SPA1-KinR517E(mSPA1) mutant compared to the wild type
SPA1-Kin domain (Fig. 1b), suggesting that the mutation affects
the kinase activity of SPA1 in vitro.
To examine whether the SPA1-Kin domain can phosphorylate
a substrate, we performed a kinase assay using myelin basic
protein (MBP), which has been widely used as a general substrate
for many kinases45. In vitro kinase assays showed that the SPA1-
Kin domain phosphorylates MBP in vitro in a concentration-
dependent manner (Fig. 1c). Notably, the SPA1-Kin auto-
phosphorylation activity reduces as the MBP phosphorylation
increases, showing a general feature of a kinase-substrate
relationship in that auto-phosphorylation of a kinase reduces as
the substrate phosphorylation increases.
SPA1 can directly phosphorylate PIF1 in vitro . Previously, we
reported that the COP1-SPA1 E3 ligase can interact with PIF1 in
a red light-induced manner and promotes its rapid degradation41.
To test whether PIF1 could be a native substrate of the SPA1
kinase, a strep-tagged full-length SPA1 protein was puri ﬁed from
a eukaryotic expression host, Pichia pastoris (Supplementary
Fig. 2a, b), and the kinase assay was performed with PIF1 as a
substrate. PIF1 was strongly phosphorylated by SPA1 in vitro
(Fig. 1d), suggesting that PIF1 might be a bona ﬁde native sub-
strate of SPA1 kinase. SPA1 also phosphorylated PIF1 in an ATP
concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1e, f). SinceSPA1 harbors a predicted ser/thr kinase domain, we further
investigated the nature of PIF1 phosphorylation by acid-base
sensitivity assays (Supplementary Fig. 2c). In the presence of
KOH, PIF1 was dephosphorylated, while PIF1 phosphorylation
was stable in HCl solution, suggesting that SPA1 is a ser/thr
kinase for PIF1.
To examine whether the conserved amino acid mutation
(R517E) on the full-length SPA1 kinase domain affects PIF1
phosphorylation, we puri ﬁed the full-length mSPA1 from Pichia
pastoris and performed the kinase assay using PIF1 as a substrate.
The mSPA1 showed signi ﬁcantly reduced PIF1 phosphorylation
compared to the wild type SPA1 (Fig. 1g). In addition, the SPA1-
Kin domain alone was able to phosphorylate PIF1, while the
mutant mSPA1-Kin exhibited reduced PIF1 phosphorylation
(Supplementary Fig. 2d). To examine if SPA1 can bind to ATP,
we performed a concentration-dependent ATP binding assay
using TNP-ATP. Results show that both wild type and mutant
form of SPA1-Kin were able to bind to TNP-ATP in a
concentration-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 2e). Both
wild type and mutant SPA1 can directly interact with PIF1
in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 2f, g), suggesting that the reduction
in PIF1 phosphorylation by the mSPA1 mutant is not due to a
reduction in physical interaction between mSPA1 and PIF1.
Taken together, these data strongly suggest that SPA1 is a bona
ﬁde ser/thr kinase that phosphorylates PIF1 in vitro.
