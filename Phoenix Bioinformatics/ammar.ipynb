      "precursor cell entry into the t cell developmental pathway can be divided into two phases by the closure of t lineage commitment as cells decide against the last alternative options to the t cell fate they turn on the transcription factor bclb and silence expression of a group of multipotent progenitor regulatory factors that include hematopoietic transcription factor pu functional perturbation tests show that bclb is needed for commitment while pu actively participates in keeping open access to alternative fates until it is silenced however pu and bclb both contribute positively to t cell development our recent work reviewed here sheds light on the transcriptional regulatory network that determines the timing and irreversibility of bclb activation the ways that notch signaling from the thymic microenvironment restricts the action of pu to prevent it from diverting cells to non t fates and the target genes that pu still regulates under the influence of notch signaling to contribute to t cell generation we argue that t cell development depends on the sequential operation of two interlaced but mutually antagonistic gene regulatory networks one initially supporting expansion before commitment and the other imposing a terminal differentiation process on committed cells \n",
