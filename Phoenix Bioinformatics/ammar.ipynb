      "the negatively photoregulated phya gene has a complex promoter structure in arabidopsis with three active transcription start sites to identify the photoreceptors responsible for regulation of this gene and to assess the relative roles of the three transcription start sites we analyzed the changes in phya transcript levels in wild type and photoreceptor mutant seedlings under various irradiation conditions continuous far red or red light exposures each induced a significant decline in transcript levels in wild type etiolated seedlings analysis of mutants specifically lacking either phya or phyb protein demonstrated that these phytochromes are required for the negative regulation induced by far red and red light respectively ribonuclease protection experiments showed further that this negative regulation is confined almost exclusively to the shortest most abundant phya transcript and occurs predominantly in shoots by contrast both of the other minor transcripts in shoots and all three transcripts in roots exhibit near constitutive expression this complex expression pattern indicates that the phya gene is subject to regulation by multiple signals including environmental developmental and organ specific signals \n",

      "as two of the most important environmental factors light and temperature regulate almost all aspects of plant growth and development under natural conditions light is accompanied by warm temperatures and darkness by cooler temperatures suggesting that light and temperature are tightly associated signals for plants indeed accumulating evidence shows that plants have evolved a wide range of mechanisms to simultaneously perceive and respond to dynamic changes in light and temperature notably the photoreceptor phytochrome b phyb was recently shown to function as a thermosensor thus reinforcing the notion that light and temperature signaling pathways are tightly associated in plants in this review we summarize and discuss the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms integrating light and temperature signaling pathways in plants with the emphasis on recent progress in temperature sensing light control of plant freezing tolerance and thermomorphogenesis we also discuss the questions that are crucial for a further understanding of the interactions between light and temperature signaling pathways in plants \n",

      "this chapter clearly demonstrates the breadth and spectrum of the processes that sumo regulates during plant development the gross phenotypes observed in mutants of the sumo conjugation and deconjugation enzymes reflect these essential roles and detailed analyses of these mutants under different growth conditions revealed roles in biotic and abiotic stress responses phosphate starvation nitrate and sulphur metabolism freezing and drought tolerance and response to excess copper sumo functions also intersect with those regulated by several hormones such as salicylic acid abscisic acid gibberellins and auxin and detailed studies provide mechanistic clues of how sumoylation may regulate these processes the regulation of cop and phyb functions by sumoylation provides very strong evidence that sumo is heavily involved in the regulation of light signaling in plants at the cellular and subcellular levels sumo regulates meristem architecture the switch from the mitotic cycle into the endocycle meiosis centromere decondensation and exit from mitosis transcriptional control and release from transcriptional silencing most of these advances in our understanding of sumo functions during plant development emerged over the past years and they may only predict a prominent rise of sumo as a major regulator of eukaryotic cellular and organismal growth and development \n",
