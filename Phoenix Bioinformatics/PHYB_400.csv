PHYTOCHROME B (phyB) regulates plant growth through perceiving both light and ambient temperature signals. However, the mechanism by which phyB mediates the plant response to cold stress remains elusive. Here, we show that the key transcription factors mediating cold acclimation, C-REPEAT BINDING FACTORs (CBFs), interact with PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 3 (PIF3) under cold stress, thus attenuating the mutually assured destruction of PIF3-phyB. Cold-stabilized phyB acts downstream of CBFs to positively regulate freezing tolerance by modulating the expression of stress-responsive and growth-related genes. Consistent with this, phyB mutants exhibited a freezing-sensitive phenotype, whereas phyB-overexpression transgenic plants displayed enhanced freezing tolerance. Further analysis showed that the PIF1, PIF4, and PIF5 proteins, all of which negatively regulate plant freezing tolerance, were destabilized by cold stress in a phytochrome-dependent manner. Collectively, our study reveals that CBFs-PIF3-phyB serves as an important regulatory module for modulating plant response to cold stress."

Auxin is a pivotal phytohormone involved in promoting hypocotyl elongation. CRY1 and phyB interact with and stabilize auxin/indole acetic acid proteins (Aux/IAAs) to inhibit auxin signaling. The present study investigated whether photoreceptors might interact directly with Auxin Response Factors (ARFs) to regulate auxin signaling. Protein-protein interaction studies demonstrated that CRY1 and phyB interact physically with ARF6 and ARF8 through their N-terminal domains in a blue and red light-dependent manner, respectively. Moreover, the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of ARF6 and ARF8 is involved in mediating their interactions with CRY1. Genetic studies showed that ARF6 and ARF8 act partially downstream from CRY1 and PHYB to regulate hypocotyl elongation under blue and red light, respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR assays demonstrated that CRY1 and phyB mediate blue and red light repression of the DNA-binding activity of ARF6 and ARF6-target gene expression, respectively. Altogether, the results herein suggest that the direct repression of auxin-responsive gene expression mediated by the interactions of CRY1 and phyB with ARFs constitutes a new layer of the regulatory mechanisms by which light inhibits auxin-induced hypocotyl elongation."

Light is a major environmental factor affecting seed germination, which is predominantly regulated by photoreceptor phytochrome B (PHYB). PHYB is activated by red light (designated as PHYB-on) whereas it is inactivated by far-red light (referred as PHYB-off). We previously reported that Arabidopsis histone deacetylase HDA15 interacts with phytochrome-interacting factor1 (PIF1) to repress seed germination under PHYB-off conditions. Here, we show that HDA15 plays a negative role in regulating seed germination under PHYB-on conditions. Overexpression of HDA15 in Arabidopsis restrains PHYB-dependent seed germination, while gibberellin (GA) relieves the repressive role of HDA15 under PHYB-off conditions. We further show that HDA15 directly binds to GA20ox1 and GA20ox2, two key GA biosynthesis genes and represses their expression by removal of histone H3 and H4 acetylation. Moreover, the levels of HDA15 transcript and HDA15 protein are up-regulated in the phyB mutant. Collectively, our work proposes that HDA15 acts as a negative regulator of PHYB-dependent seed germination by directly repressing GA20ox1/2 gene expression."

In Arabidopsis, warmer temperature accelerates flowering and increases elongation growth (thermomorphogenesis). However, the mechanisms of temperature perception are largely unknown. We describe a major thermosensory role for the phytochromes (red light receptors) during the night. Phytochrome null plants display a constitutive warm-temperature response, and consistent with this, we show in this background that the warm-temperature transcriptome becomes derepressed at low temperatures. We found that phytochrome B (phyB) directly associates with the promoters of key target genes in a temperature-dependent manner. The rate of phyB inactivation is proportional to temperature in the dark, enabling phytochromes to function as thermal timers that integrate temperature information over the course of the night."

Nonetheless, recent studies have shed light on the importance of alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) in photomorphogenesis. The splicing factors splicing factor for phytochrome signaling (SFPS) and reduced red-light responses in cry1cry2 background1 (RRC1) are involved in the phytochrome B (phyB) signaling pathway and promote photomorphogenesis by controlling pre-mRNA splicing of light- and clock-related genes. However, splicing factors that serve as repressors in phyB signaling pathway remain unreported. Here, we report that the splicing factor SWELLMAP 2 (SMP2) suppresses photomorphogenesis in the light. SMP2 physically interacts with phyB and colocalizes with phyB in photobodies after light exposure. Genetic analyses show that SMP2 antagonizes phyB signaling to promote hypocotyl elongation in the light. The homologs of SMP2 in yeast and human belong to second-step splicing factors required for proper selection of the 3' splice site (3'SS) of an intron. Notably, SMP2 reduces the abundance of the functional REVEILLE 8 a (RVE8a) form, probably by determining the 3'SS, and thereby inhibits RVE8-mediated transcriptional activation of clock genes containing evening elements (EE). Finally, SMP2-mediated reduction of functional RVE8 isoform promotes phytochrome interacting factor 4 (PIF4) expression to fine-tune hypocotyl elongation in the light. Taken together, our data unveil a phyB-interacting splicing factor that negatively regulates photomorphogenesis, providing additional information for further mechanistic investigations regarding phyB-controlled AS of light- and clock-related genes."

Shade avoidance syndrome is a strategy of major adaptive significance that includes seed germination, elongation of vegetative structures, leaf hyponasty, and acceleration of flowering. Previously, we found that the southernmost Arabidopsis accession, collected in the south of Patagonia (Pat), is hyposensitive to light and displays a reduced response to shade light. This work aimed to explore the genetic basis of the shade avoidance response (SAR) for hypocotyl growth by QTL mapping in a recently developed 162 RIL population between Col-0 and Pat. We mapped four QTL for seedling hypocotyl growth: WL1 and WL2 QTL in white light, SHADE1 QTL in shade light, and SAR1 QTL for the SAR. PHYB is the strongest candidate gene for SAR1 QTL. Here we studied the function of two polymorphic indels in the promoter region, a GGGR deletion, and three non-synonymous polymorphisms on the PHYB coding region compared with the Col-0 reference genome. To decipher the contribution and relevance of each PHYB-Pat polymorphism, we constructed transgenic lines with single or double polymorphisms by using Col-0 as a reference genome. We found that single polymorphisms in the coding region of PHYB have discrete functions in seed germination, seedling development, and shade avoidance response. These results suggest distinct functions for each PHYB polymorphism to the adjustment of plant development to variable light conditions."

In contrast, brassinosteroids (BRs) are major hypocotyl elongation-promoting hormones in plants, which could optimize photomorphogenesis concurrent with external light. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the antagonism of light and BR signaling remain largely unknown. Here we show that the Arabidopsis red light receptor phyB is involved in inhibition of BR signaling via its direct interaction with the BR transcription factor BES1. In our study, the phyB mutant displays BR hypersensitivity, which is repressed in transgenic plants overexpressing phyB, suggesting that phyB negatively regulates the BR signaling pathway. In addition, protein interaction results show that phyB directly interacts with dephosphorylated BES1, the physiologically active form of BES1 induced by BR, in a red light-dependent manner. Genetic analyses suggest that phyB may act partially through BES1 to regulate BR signaling. Transcriptomic data and quantitative real-time PCR assay further show that phyB-mediated red light inhibits BR signaling by repressing expression of BES1 target genes, including the BR biosynthesis genes DWF4, the SAUR family and the PRE family genes required for promoting cell elongation. Finally, we found that red light treatment inhibits the DNA-binding activity of BES1 and photoactivated phyB represses the transcriptional activity of BES1 under red light. Taken together, we suggest that the interaction of phyB with dephosphorylated BES1 may allow plants to balance light and BR signaling by repressing transcriptional activity of BES1 to regulate expression of its target genes."

However, the role of light signaling in plant Fe uptake remains uncharacterized. Here, we find that light-induced Fe uptake in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is largely dependent on phytochrome B (phyB). Light induces the phyB-dependent accumulation of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) protein both in the leaves and roots. HY5 movement from shoots to roots activates the expression of FER transcription factor, leading to the accumulation of transcripts involved in Fe uptake. Mutation in FER abolishes the light quality-induced changes in Fe uptake. The low Fe uptake observed in phyB, hy5, and fer mutants is accompanied by lower photosynthetic electron transport rates. Exposure to red light at night increases Fe accumulation in wild-type fruit but has little effects on fruit of phyB mutants. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Fe uptake is systemically regulated by light in a phyB-HY5-FER-dependent manner. These findings provide new insights how the manipulation of light quality could be used to improve Fe uptake and hence the nutritional quality of crops."

Increased rates of thermal reversion upon exposing Arabidopsis seedlings to warm environments reduce both the abundance of the biologically active Pfr-Pfr dimer pool of phyB and the size of the associated nuclear bodies, even in daylight. Mathematical analysis of stem growth for seedlings expressing wild-type phyB or thermally stable variants under various combinations of light and temperature revealed that phyB is physiologically responsive to both signals.

Notably, the photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB) was recently shown to function as a thermosensor, thus reinforcing the notion that light and temperature signaling pathways are tightly associated in plants. In this review, we summarize and discuss the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms integrating light and temperature signaling pathways in plants, with the emphasis on recent progress in temperature sensing, light control of plant freezing tolerance, and thermomorphogenesis.

This capacity is driven by its C terminus through self-association, whereas the intrinsically disordered N-terminal extension (NTE) functions as a biophysical modulator of phase separation. Light exposure triggers a conformational change to subsequently alter phyB condensate assembly, while temperature sensation is directly mediated by the NTE to modulate the phase behavior of phyB droplets. Multiple signaling components are selectively incorporated into phyB droplets to form concentrated microreactors, allowing switch-like control of phyB signaling activity through phase transitions. Therefore, light and temperature cues are separately read out by phyB via allosteric changes and spontaneous phase separation, respectively. We provide a conceptual framework showing how the distinct but highly correlated physical signals are interpreted and sorted by one receptor."

Here we show that SPA1 acts as a serine/threonine kinase and directly phosphorylates PIF1 in vitro and in vivo. SPAs are necessary for the light-induced phosphorylation, ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PIF1. Moreover, the red/far-red light photoreceptor phyB interacts with SPA1 through its C-terminus and enhances the recruitment of PIF1 for phosphorylation.

Despite extensive biochemical studies, full understanding of plant Phy signalling has remained unclear due to the absence of relevant 3D models. Here we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of Arabidopsis PhyB in the Pr state that reveals a topologically complex dimeric organization that is substantially distinct from its prokaryotic relatives. Instead of an anticipated parallel architecture, the C-terminal histidine-kinase-related domains (HKRDs) associate head-to-head, whereas the N-terminal photosensory regions associate head-to-tail to form a parallelogram-shaped platform with near two-fold symmetry. The platform is internally linked by the second of two internal Per/Arnt/Sim domains that binds to the photosensory module of the opposing protomer and a preceding 'modulator' loop that assembles tightly with the photosensory module of its own protomer. Both connections accelerate the thermal reversion of Pfr back to Pr, consistent with an inverse relationship between dimer assembly and Pfr stability. Lopsided contacts between the HKRDs and the platform create profound asymmetry to PhyB that might imbue distinct signalling potentials to the protomers. We propose that this unique structural dynamism creates an extensive photostate-sensitive surface for conformation-dependent interactions between plant Phy photoreceptors and their signalling partners."

We have isolated overlapping cDNA and genomic clones encoding the entire phyB polypeptide. This monocot sequence is more closely related to phyB from the dicot, Arabidopsis (73% amino acid sequence identity), than it is to the phyA gene in the rice genome (50% identity). These data support the proposal that phyA and phyB subfamilies diverged early in plant evolution and that subsequent divergence accompanied the evolution of monocots and dicots. Moreover, since rice and Arabidopsis phyB polypeptides are more closely related to one another (73% identity) than are monocot and dicot phyA sequences (63-65% identity), it appears that phyB has evolved more slowly than phyA. Sequence conservation between phyA and phyB is greatest in a central core region surrounding the chromophore attachment site, and least toward the amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal ends of the polypeptides, although hydropathy analysis suggests that the overall structure of the two phytochromes has been conserved. Gene-specific Northern blot analysis indicates that, whereas phyA is negatively regulated by phytochrome in rice seedling shoots in the manner typical of monocots, phyB is constitutively expressed irrespective of light treatment. In consequence, phyA and phyB transcripts are equally abundant in fully green tissue. Since Arabidopsis phyB mRNA levels are also unaffected by light, the present results suggest that this mode of regulation is evolutionarily conserved among phyB genes, perhaps reflecting differences in the functional roles of the different phytochrome subfamilies."

We analyzed our experimental data using a mathematical model containing multiple Pfr conformers, in accordance with previous findings.

Moench] phyB-1 mutant exhibits a constitutive shade-avoidance phenotype including excessive shoot elongation. It was previously shown that this mutant also overproduces ethylene. Although phytochrome B (phyB) is assumed to be the pigment most important in sensing and transducing shade signals, the sorghum phyB-1 mutant still responds to light signals characteristic of shade. Specifically, it was determined that the leaf blade : leaf sheath elongation of phyB-1 is responsive to red : far red (R : FR), but this response is opposite that of wild type (WT). Reducing the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) strongly reduced the leaf blade : leaf sheath of WT but did not affect phyB-1, demonstrating a role for phyB in sensing PPFD. Using light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, it was found that WT ethylene production was increased with low R : FR while PPFD had no effect. Conversely, phyB-1 ethylene production increased only with high PPFD, high R : FR which was the treatment resulting in the least ethylene production by WT. Elevated ethylene production inhibits shoot elongation, but may contribute to shade avoidance by reducing leaf blade : leaf sheath elongation. Ethylene responses to light treatments designed to promote or reduce phytochrome A (phyA) activity, and the analysis of PHYA levels in the two cultivars suggests that phyA could be involved in transducing shade signals in light-grown sorghum. Responses potentially tranduced by phyA are elevated in phyB-1 which also over-expresses PHYA."

Here, we show that epidermis-specific expression of PIF4 induces constitutive long hypocotyls, while vasculature-specific expression of PIF4 has no effect on hypocotyl growth. RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR analyses reveal that auxin-responsive genes and growth-related genes are highly activated by epidermal, but not by vascular, PIF4. Additionally, inactivation of epidermal PIF4 or auxin signaling, and overexpression of epidermal phyB suppresses thermoresponsive growth, indicating that epidermal PIF4-auxin pathways are essential for the temperature responses. Further, we show that high temperatures increase both epidermal PIF4 transcription and the epidermal PIF4 DNA-binding ability. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the epidermis regulates thermoresponsive growth through the phyB-PIF4-auxin pathway."

The response of plants to high ambient temperature, termed thermomorphogenesis, is characterized by hypocotyl and petiole elongation and hyponastic growth at the seedling stage. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanism of thermomorphogenesis is still rudimentary. Here, we show that a set of four SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 (SPA) genes is required for thermomorphogenesis. Consistently, SPAs are necessary for global changes in gene expression in response to high ambient temperature. In the spaQ mutant at high ambient temperature, the level of SPA1 is unaffected, whereas the thermosensor phytochrome B (phyB) is stabilized. Furthermore, in the absence of four SPA genes, the pivotal transcription factor PIF4 fails to accumulate, indicating a role of SPAs in regulating the phyB-PIF4 module at high ambient temperature. SPA1 directly phosphorylates PIF4 in vitro, and a mutant SPA1 affecting the kinase activity fails to rescue the PIF4 level in addition to the thermo-insensitive phenotype of spaQ, suggesting that the SPA1 kinase activity is necessary for thermomorphogenesis. Taken together, these data suggest that SPAs are new components that integrate light and temperature signaling by fine-tuning the phyB-PIF4 module."

Either its expression or its accumulation peaks in the morning and afternoon. WRKY2 and WRKY10 form heterodimers and recognize their target site in the PIF4 promoter near the MYB element that is bound by CCA1 and LHY under red and blue light. WRKY2 and WRKY10 interact directly with CCA1/LHY to enhance their targeting but interact indirectly with SHB1. The two WRKY proteins also interact with phyB, and their interaction enhances the targeting of CCA1 and LHY to the PIF4 promoter. SHB1 associates with the WRKY2 and WRKY10 loci and enhances their expression in parallel with the PIF4 expression peaks. This forward regulatory loop further sustains the accumulation of the two WRKY proteins and the targeting of CCA1/LHY to the PIF4 locus. In summary, interactions of two WRKY proteins with CCA1/LHY and phyB maintain an optimal expression level of PIF4 toward noon and afternoon, which is essential to sketch the circadian pattern of PIF4 expression."

In this study, we investigated the role of phyA and phyB in regulating leaf senescence under FR in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). FR enrichment and intermittent FR pulses promoted the senescence of Arabidopsis leaves. Additionally, phyA and phyB mutants showed enhanced and repressed senescence phenotypes in FR, respectively, indicating that phyA and phyB antagonistically regulate FR-dependent leaf senescence. Transcriptomic analysis using phyA and phyB mutants in FR identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in leaf senescence-related processes, such as responses to light, phytohormones, temperature, photosynthesis and defense, showing opposite expression patterns in phyA and phyB mutants. These contrasting expression profiles of DEGs support the antagonism between phyA and phyB in FR-dependent leaf senescence. Among the genes showing antagonistic regulation, we confirmed that the expression of WRKY6, which encodes a senescence-associated transcription factor, was negatively and positively regulated by phyA and phyB, respectively. The wrky6 mutant showed a repressed senescence phenotype compared with the wild type in FR, indicating that WRKY6 plays a positive role in FR-dependent leaf senescence.

However, the upstream guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) RopGEFs have not been revealed, and it is unclear which photoreceptor is required for the action of RopGEFs-ROPs. Here, we showed that RopGEF2 acted as a negative regulator in phytochrome B (phyB)-mediated red light-induced stomatal opening. Meanwhile, ROP7, another member of ROP family, acting redundantly with ROP2, was regulated by RopGEF2 in this process. RopGEF2 interacted with ROP7 and ROP2 and enhanced their intrinsic nucleotide exchange rates. Furthermore, the direct interactions between phyB and RopGEF2 were detected in vitro and in plants, and phyB enhanced the GEF activity of RopGEF2 toward both ROP7 and ROP2 under light. In addition, RopGEF4 functioned redundantly with RopGEF2 in red light-induced stomatal opening by activating both ROP7 and ROP2, and RopGEF2/RopGEF4 acted genetically downstream of phyB; however, the GEF activity of RopGEF4 was not directly enhanced by phyB.

Both phyA and phyB, the two best characterized phytochromes, regulate plant photomorphogenesis predominantly under far-red light and red light, respectively. It has been demonstrated that SPA1 (SUPPRESSOR OF PHYTOCHROME A 1) associates with COP1 to promote COP1 activity and suppress photomorphogenesis. Here, we report that the mechanism underlying phyB-promoted photomorphogenesis in red light involves direct physical and functional interactions between red-light-activated phyB and SPA1.

Protein interaction studies in both yeast and Arabidopsis demonstrated that the photoactivated phyB represses the association of SPA1 with COP1, which is mediated, at least in part, through red-light-dependent interaction of phyB with SPA1. Moreover, we show that phyA physically interacts with SPA1 in a Pfr-form-dependent manner, and that SPA1 acts downstream of PHYA to regulate photomorphogenesis in far-red light.

Expression analysis indicates that the PB-phyB, PB-phyD, and PB-phyE transgenes are transcriptionally and translationally active. However, whereas the PB-phyB transgene complements the phyB-1 red light hypocotyl growth phenotype completely, the PB-phyD and PB-phyE transgenes are only weakly active in restoring seedling growth regulation. Red light fluence curves indicate that this difference is not likely to be due to differences in dark reversion rates. The PB-phyD and PB-phyE transgenes also both partially restore the rosette leaf morphology phenotype of the phyB-1 mutant. However, the PB-phyD gene complements the early flowering phenotype of phyB-1 very strongly whereas PB-phyE does not.

When mobilized by the Arabidopsis thaliana β-glucosidase 1 (AtBG1), the glucose ester-conjugated inactive form of ABA has proven to be a source of the active hormone that is essential for the adaptation of the plant to water deficit, as evidenced by the impaired stomatal closure of atbg1 mutants in response to water stress. In a suppressor screen designed to identify the molecular components of AtBG1-associated physiological and developmental mechanisms, we identified the mutation variant of AtBG1 traits (vat1), a new mutant allele of the red light/far-red light photoreceptor PHYTOCHROME B (PHYB). Our study reveals that atbg1 plants harbor increased stomatal density in addition to impaired stomatal closure. We also provide evidence that the vat1/phyb mutation can restore the apparent transpiration of the atbg1 mutant by decreasing stomatal aperture and restoring a stomatal density similar to wild-type plants. Expression of key regulators of stomatal development showed a crosstalk between AtBG1-mediated ABA signaling and PHYB-mediated stomatal development.

At the mature stage, more than one lobe in the double mutant was just consisted of several cell layers. To identify genes involved in phytochrome-mediated anther development, anther transcriptomes of phyA, phyB and phyA phyB mutants were compared to that of wild-type rice respectively. Analysis of 2,241 double-mutant-specific differentially expressed transcripts revealed that the metabolic profiles, especially carbohydrate metabolism, were altered greatly, and heat-shock responses were activated in the double mutant.

This inhibition is specific to phyB in that the levels of the four other phytochromes, notably the closely related phyD and phyE phytochromes, are unaffected in the antisense lines. Antisense-induced reduction in phyB causes alterations of red light effects on seedling hypocotyl elongation, rosette leaf morphology, and chlorophyll content, similar to the phenotypic changes caused by phyB null mutations. However, unlike the phyB mutants, the antisense lines do not flower early compared to the wild type. Furthermore, unlike the phyB mutants, the antisense lines do not show a reduction in phyC level compared to the wild type, making it possible to unequivocally associate several of the photomorphogenic effects seen in phyB mutants with phytochrome B alone.

The full reversibility of the R-induced germination by subsequent FR pulses, and the observation that the response is reversible by FR, even after a 3-h R treatment, indicates that this phyX response belongs to the low-fluence-response type. Thus, this phyX response is functionally related to phyB-mediated responses. However, in contrast to phyB-controlled seed germination, this phyX-mediated response needs a prolonged imbibition period and exhibits reversibility kinetics different from that needed for phyB. Furthermore, this phyX response requires a prolonged irradiation time and shows a fluence rate response dependency, showing a similarity to the high irradiance response of photomorphogenesis.

The data indicate that regulation is at the transcriptional level. In dry seed, PHYB-GUS is expressed throughout the embryo at three-fold higher levels than PHYB-GUS, which is confined primarily to the embryonic root tip. By contrast, PHYA promoter activity, despite strong negative regulation in shoots by light, is consistently higher than PHYB (two- to 20-fold) in both the light and dark in most tissues during all subsequent developmental phases, from seedling to mature adult. At the tissue level, most cells appear to express both transgenes at some level at all stages examined, with highest apparent activity in vascular tissue and root tips. With the notable exception of pollen, where high PHYB-GUS but not PHYA-GUS expression occurs, few major differences are observed in the quantitative spatial distribution pattern between the two transgenes.

A total of 720 known miRNAs, 704 novel miRNAs and 1957 target genes were identified from the fourth leaves of wild-type (WT) and phyB mutant rice at the five-leaf stage. Among them, 135 miRNAs showed differential expression, suggesting that the expression of these miRNAs is directly or indirectly under the control of phyB. In addition, 32 out of the 135 differentially expressed miRNAs were found to slice 70 genes in the rice genome. Analysis of these target genes showed that members of various transcription factor families constituted the largest proportion, indicating miRNAs are probably involved in the phyB-mediated light signaling pathway mainly by regulating the expression of transcription factors. Our results provide new clues for functional characterization of miRNAs in the phyB-mediated light signaling pathway, which should be helpful in comprehensively uncovering the molecular mechanisms of phytochrome-mediated photomorphogenesis and stress responses in plants."

To investigate possible cross-regulation of these receptors, we have identified monoclonal antibodies that specifically detect each of the five Arabidopsis phytochromes, phyA to phyE (phytochrome A holoprotein; PHYA, phytochrome A apoprotein; PHYA, phytochrome A gene; phyA, mutant allele of phytochrome A gene), on immunoblots and have used them to analyze the effects of phyA and phyB null mutations on the levels of all five family members. In phyB mutants, but not in phyA mutants, a four- to six-fold reduction in the level of phyC is observed in tissues grown either in the dark or in the light. Coordinate expression of phyB and phyC is induced in the phyB mutant background by the presence of a complementing PHYB transgene. However, in transgenic lines that overexpress phyB 15- to 20-fold, phyC is not similarly overexpressed. In these overexpressor lines, the levels of phyA, phyC, and phyD are increased two- to four-fold over normal in light-grown but not dark-grown seedlings. These observations indicate that molecular mechanisms for coordination or cross-regulation of phytochrome levels are active in Arabidopsis and have implications for the interpretation of phytochrome mutants and overexpressor lines."

Double mutations in LHY and CCA1 (lhy;cca1) accelerated flowering under short days, mainly by the GI-CO dependent pathway. In contrast, lhy;cca1 showed delayed flowering under continuous light (LL), probably due to the GI-CO independent pathway. This late-flowering phenotype was suppressed by svp, flc, and elf3. However, how SVP, FLC, and ELF3 mediate LHY/CCA1 and flowering time is not fully understood. We found that lhy;cca1 exhibited short hypocotyls and petioles under LL, but the molecular mechanism for these effects has not been elucidated. To address these questions, we performed a screen for mutations that suppress either or both of the lhy;cca1 phenotypes under LL, using two different approaches. We identified two novel mutations, a dominant (del1) and a recessive (phyB-2511) allele of phyB. The flowering times of single mutants of three phyB alleles, hy3-1, del1, and phyB-2511, are almost the same and earlier than those of wild-type plants. A similar level of acceleration of flowering time was observed in all three phyB mutants tested when combined with the late-flowering mutations co-2 and SVPox. However, the effect of phyB-2511 on lhy;cca1 was different from those by hy3-1 or del1. svp-3 did not strongly enhance the early-flowering phenotypes of phyB-2511 or del1. These results suggest that light signaling via PhyB may affect factors downstream of the clock proteins, controlling flowering time and organ elongation. phyB mutations with different levels of effects on lhy;cca1-dependent late flowering would be useful to determine a specific role for PHYB in the flowering pathway controlled by lhy;cca1 under LL."

In dark-grown seedlings, both promoters are 4-fold more active in shoots than in roots,but the PHYA promoter is nearly 20-fold more active than that of PHYB in both organs. In shoots, white light represses the activities of the PHYA and PHYB promoters 10- and 2-fold, respectively, whereas in roots light has no effect on the PHYA promoter but increases PHYB promoter activity 2-fold. Consequently, PHYA promoter activity remains higher than that of PHYB in light in both shoots (5-fold) and roots (11-fold). Experiments with narrow-waveband light and photomorphogenic mutants suggest that no single photoreceptor is necessary for full white-light-directed PHYA repression in shoots, but that multiple, independent photoreceptor pathways are sufficient alone or in combination. In contrast, phytochrome B appears both necessary and sufficient for a light-mediated decrease in PHYB activity in shoots, and phytochrome A mediates a far-red-light-stimulated increase in PHYB promoter activity. Together, the data indicate that the PHYA and PHYB genes are regulated in divergent fashion at the transcriptional level, both developmentally and by the spectral distribution of the prevailing light, and that this regulation may be important to the photosensory function of the two photoreceptors."

Tillering is inhibited in sorghum genotypes that lack phytochrome B (58M, phyB-1) until after floral initiation. The growth of tiller buds in the first leaf axil of wild-type (100M, PHYB) and phyB-1 sorghum genotypes is similar until 6 d after planting when buds of phyB-1 arrest growth, while wild-type buds continue growing and develop into tillers. Transcriptome analysis at this early stage of bud development identified numerous genes that were up to 50-fold differentially expressed in wild-type/phyB-1 buds. Up-regulation of terminal flower1, GA2oxidase, and TPPI could protect axillary meristems in phyB-1 from precocious floral induction and decrease bud sensitivity to sugar signals. After bud growth arrest in phyB-1, expression of dormancy-associated genes such as DRM1, GT1, AF1, and CKX1 increased and ENOD93, ACCoxidase, ARR3/6/9, CGA1, and SHY2 decreased. Continued bud outgrowth in wild-type was correlated with increased expression of genes encoding a SWEET transporter and cell wall invertases. The SWEET transporter may facilitate Suc unloading from the phloem to the apoplast where cell wall invertases generate monosaccharides for uptake and utilization to sustain bud outgrowth. Elevated expression of these genes was correlated with higher levels of cytokinin/sugar signaling in growing buds of wild-type plants."

The srl1 mutant shows enhanced responsiveness to continuous red but not far-red light, in both wild-type and ABO backgrounds, consistent with involvement in the phyB-signaling pathway but not that of phyA. The hypersensitive phenotype of srl1 is not due to overexpression of endogenous phyA or phyB, and the locus maps to the center of chromosome 2, distinct from any other known photomorphogenic mutants. srl1 seedlings display enhancement of several phyB-mediated responses, including shorter hypocotyls, more expanded cotyledons, shorter petioles and modestly higher levels of CAB gene expression under red light than the wild type. Double mutant analyses show that the hypersensitive phenotype of srl1 is completely phyB-dependent.

The intracellular signaling pathway from the light-activated photoreceptor conformer (Pfr) to the transcriptional network that drives these responses involves direct, physical interaction of Pfr with a small subfamily of bHLH transcription factors, termed Phy-Interacting Factors (PIFs), which induces rapid PIF proteolytic degradation. In addition, there is evidence of further complexity in light-grown seedlings, whereby phyB-PIF interaction reciprocally induces phyB degradation, in a mutually-negative, feedback-loop configuration. Here, to assess the relative contributions of these antagonistic activities to the net phenotypic readout in light-grown seedlings, we have examined the magnitude of the light- and simulated-shade-induced responses of a pentuple phyBpif1pif3pif4pif5 (phyBpifq) mutant and various multiple pif-mutant combinations. The data (1) reaffirm that phyB is the predominant, if not exclusive, photoreceptor imposing the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in deetiolating seedlings in response to prolonged continuous R irradiation and (2) show that the PIF quartet (PIF1, PIF3, PIF4, and PIF5) retain and exert a dual capacity to modulate hypocotyl elongation under these conditions, by concomitantly promoting cell elongation through intrinsic transcriptional-regulatory activity, and reducing phyB-inhibitory capacity through feedback-loop-induced phyB degradation. In shade-exposed seedlings, immunoblot analysis shows that the shade-imposed reduction in Pfr levels induces increases in the abundance of PIF3, and mutant analysis indicates that PIF3 acts, in conjunction with PIF4 and PIF5, to promote the known shade-induced acceleration of hypocotyl elongation. Conversely, although the quadruple pifq mutant displays clearly reduced hypocotyl elongation compared to wild-type in response to prolonged shade, immunoblot analysis detects no elevation in phyB levels in the mutant seedlings compared to the wild-type during the majority of the shade-induced growth period, and phyB levels are not robustly correlated with the growth phenotype across the pif-mutant combinations compared. These results suggest that PIF feedback modulation of phyB abundance does not play a dominant role in modulating the magnitude of the PIF-promoted, shade-responsive phenotype under these conditions. In seedlings grown under diurnal light-dark cycles, the data show that FR-pulse-induced removal of Pfr at the beginning of the dark period (End-of-Day-FR (EOD-FR) treatment) results in longer hypocotyls relative to no EOD-FR treatment and that this effect is attenuated in the pif-mutant combinations tested. This result similarly indicates that the PIF quartet members are capable of intrinsically promoting hypocotyl cell elongation in light-grown plants, independently of the effects of PIF feedback modulation of photoactivated-phyB abundance."

Distinct metabolic profiles between phyA phyB phyC triple mutants and the wild type (WT), as well as those between young and mature leaf blades, could be clearly observed by principal component analysis (PCA). The metabolite profiles indicated high accumulation of amino acids, organic acids, sugars, sugar phosphates, and nucleotides in the leaf blades of phyA phyB phyC triple mutants, especially in the young leaves, compared with those in the WT. Remarkable overaccumulation of monosaccharide, such as glucose (53.4-fold), fructose (42.5-fold), and galactose (24.5-fold), was observed in young leaves of phyA phyB phyC triple mutants. These metabolic phenotypes suggest that sugar metabolism, carbon partitioning, sugar transport, or some combination of these is impaired in the phyA phyB phyC triple mutants, and conversely, that phytochromes have crucial roles in sugar metabolism."

Analysis of mutants specifically lacking either phyA or phyB protein demonstrated that these phytochromes are required for the negative regulation induced by far-red and red light, respectively.

The cryptochrome and phytochrome signaling mechanisms interact directly with CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1), a RING motif-containing E3 ligase that acts to negatively regulate photomorphogenesis. COP1 interacts with and ubiquitinates the transcription factors that promote photomorphogenesis, such as ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 and LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED1 (HFR1), to inhibit photomorphogenic development. Here, we show that COP1 physically interacts with PIF3-LIKE1 (PIL1) and promotes PIL1 degradation via the 26S proteasome. We further demonstrate that phyB physically interacts with PIL1 and enhances PIL1 protein accumulation upon red light irradiation, probably through suppressing the COP1-PIL1 association. Biochemical and genetic studies indicate that PIL1 and HFR1 form heterodimers and promote photomorphogenesis cooperatively. Moreover, we demonstrate that PIL1 interacts with PIF1, 3, 4, and 5, resulting in the inhibition of the transcription of PIF direct-target genes. Our results reveal that PIL1 stability is regulated by phyB and COP1, likely through physical interactions, and that PIL1 coordinates with HFR1 to inhibit the transcriptional activity of PIFs, suggesting that PIL1, HFR1, and PIFs constitute a subset of antagonistic basic helix-loop-helix factors acting downstream of phyB and COP1 to regulate photomorphogenic development."

Examination of fluence-rate response dependencies in phot1 and phot2 mutants revealed that although both photoreceptors are capable of inducing chloroplast accumulation under low-light conditions, the signals from these photoreceptors appear to be antagonistic. Chloroplast movements in wild-type plants were intermediate between those of the single phot mutants, consistent with each operating through separate signalling cascades. Mutants in phot2 showed transient chloroplast avoidance responses upon exposure to intense blue light, and slow but sustained chloroplast avoidance under intense white light, indicating that in the absence of phot2, phot1 is capable of generating both a low and a high-light response signal. Mutations in phytochrome B (phyB) caused an enhanced avoidance response at intermediate and high light intensities. Examination of phyB, phot1phyB, and phot2phyB mutants indicated that this enhancement is caused by PhyB inhibition of the high-light avoidance response in wild-type plants.

Here, we demonstrate that SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1 (SMAX1), known as a karrikin signaling repressor, enhances the thermosensitivity of hypocotyl morphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Hypocotyl thermomorphogenesis was largely disrupted in SMAX1-deficient mutants. SMAX1 interacts with phyB to alleviate its suppressive effects on the transcription factor activity of PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4), promoting hypocotyl thermomorphogenesis.

To gain insight into the molecular mechanism underlying this complex phenotype, we generated transgenic lines expressing the mutant and wild-type phyB in phyB-9 background. Analysis of these transgenic lines demonstrated that the mutant photoreceptor displays a reduced rate of dark-reversion but normal P(fr) to P(r) photoconversion in vivo and shows an altered pattern of association/dissociation with nuclear bodies compared to wild-type phyB. In addition we show (i) an enhanced responsiveness to far-red light for hypocotyl growth inhibition and CAB2 expression and (ii) that far-red light mediated photoreversibility of red light induced responses, including inhibition of hypocotyl growth, formation of nuclear bodies and induction of CAB2 expression is reduced in these transgenic lines. We hypothesize that the incomplete photoreversibility of signalling is due to the fact that far-red light induced photoconversion of the chromophore is at least partially uncoupled from the P(fr) to P(r) conformation change of the protein. It follows that the phyB-401 photoreceptor retains a P(fr)-like structure (P(r) (*)) for a few hours after the far-red light treatment.

Under conditions deficient for cry1 (short exposures to blue light) or phyB (far-red background), these photoreceptors acted synergistically: Under short exposures to blue light (3 h/d) added to a red-light background, cry1 activity required phyB (e.g. the hy4 mutant was taller than the wild type but the phyBhy4 mutant was not taller than the phyB mutant).

To localize the sequence determinants of these functional differences, chimeric proteins were constructed by shuffling amino-terminal, central, and carboxy-terminal regions of phyB and phyD. Overexpression analysis of the phyB/D chimeras shows that it is the central region of these proteins that is most critical in determining their respective activities."

Similar to PIF3, upon light exposure, PIF7 rapidly migrates to intranuclear speckles, where it colocalizes with phyB. However, in striking contrast to PIF3, this process is not accompanied by detectable light-induced phosphorylation or degradation of PIF7, suggesting that the consequences of interaction with photoactivated phyB may differ among PIFs. Nevertheless, PIF7 acts similarly to PIF3 in prolonged red light as a weak negative regulator of phyB-mediated seedling deetiolation. Examination of pif3, pif4, and pif7 double mutant combinations shows that their moderate hypersensitivity to extended red light is additive. We provide evidence that the mechanism by which these PIFs operate on the phyB signaling pathway under prolonged red light is through maintaining low phyB protein levels, in an additive or synergistic manner, via a process likely involving the proteasome pathway. These data suggest that the role of these phyB-interacting bHLH factors in modulating seedling deetiolation in prolonged red light may not be as phy-activated signaling intermediates, as proposed previously, but as direct modulators of the abundance of the photoreceptor."

The recessive srr1 null allele and phyB mutants display a number of similar phenotypes indicating that SRR1 is required for normal phyB signaling. Genetic analysis suggests that SRR1 works both in the phyB pathway but also independently of phyB. srr1 mutants are affected in multiple outputs of the circadian clock in continuous light conditions, including leaf movement and expression of the clock components, CCA1 and TOC1. Clock-regulated gene expression is also impaired during day-night cycles and in constant darkness. The circadian phenotypes of srr1 mutants in all three conditions suggest that SRR1 activity is required for normal oscillator function. The SRR1 gene was identified and shown to code for a protein conserved in numerous eukaryotes including mammals and flies, implicating a conserved role for this protein in both the animal and plant kingdoms."

Further analysis showed that PhyB interacts with phytochrome-interacting factor-like 15 (PIL15), brassinazole resistant 1 (BZR1), and vascular plant one-zinc-finger 2 (VOZ2). Plants overexpressing PIL15 were more susceptible to ShB in contrast to bzr1-D-overexpressing plants compared with the wild-type, suggesting that PhyB may inhibit BZR1 to negatively regulate rice resistance to ShB. Although BZR1 is known to regulate brassinosteroid (BR) signalling, the observation that BR signalling negatively regulated resistance to ShB indicated an independent role for BZR1 in controlling rice resistance. It was also found that the BZR1 ligand NAC028 positively regulated resistance to ShB. RNA sequencing showed that cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 8B (CAD8B), involved in lignin biosynthesis was upregulated in both bzr1-D- and NAC028-overexpressing plants compared with the wild-type. Yeast-one hybrid, ChIP, and transactivation assays demonstrated that BZR1 and NAC028 activate CAD8B directly.

Comparison of the observed expression patterns with those induced by continuous monochromatic far-red light (FRc; perceived exclusively by phyA) in WT and phyA null-mutant seedlings suggests early convergence of the FRc and Rc photosensory pathways to control a largely common transcriptional network. phyB mutant seedlings retain a surprisingly high level of responsiveness to Rc for the majority of Rc-regulated genes on the microarray, indicating that one or more other phys have a major role in regulating their expression. Combined with the robust visible morphogenic phenotype of the phyB mutant in Rc, these data suggest that different members of the phy family act in organ-specific fashion in regulating seedling de-etiolation. Specifically, phyB appears to be the dominant, if not exclusive, photoreceptor in regulating a minority population of genes involved in suppression of hypocotyl cell elongation in response to Rc signals. By contrast, this sensory function is apparently shared by one or more other phys in regulating the majority Rc-responsive gene set involved in other important facets of the de-etiolation process in the apical region, such as cotyledon cell expansion."

However, we have shown that the production of chromophores used in Phytochrome B (PhyB) optogenetics is greatly enhanced in mammalian cells by expressing bacterial and plant Fds with ferredoxin-NADP+ reductases (FNR). We delineated the rate limiting factors and found that the main metabolic precursor, heme, was not the primary limiting factor for producing either the cyanobacterial or plant chromophores, phycocyanobilin or phytochromobilin, respectively. In fact, Fd is limiting, followed by Fd+FNR and finally heme. Using these findings, we optimized the PCB production system and combined it with a tissue penetrating red/far-red sensing PhyB optogenetic gene switch in animal cells. We further characterized this system in several mammalian cell lines using red and far-red light. Importantly, we found that the light-switchable gene system remains active for several hours upon illumination, even with a short light pulse, and requires very small amounts of light for maximal activation. Boosting chromophore production by matching metabolic pathways with specific ferredoxin systems will enable the unparalleled use of the many PhyB optogenetic tools and has broader implications for optimizing synthetic metabolic pathways."

In some species, phyB perceives seasonal daylength cues. phyB affects the activity of several transcriptional regulators either by direct physical interaction or indirectly by physical interaction with proteins involved in the turnover of transcriptional regulators. Typically, interaction of a protein with phyB has either negative or positive effects on the interaction of the latter with a third party, this being another protein or DNA. Thus, phyB mediates the context-dependent modulation of the transcriptome underlying changes in plant morphology, physiology, and susceptibility to biotic and abiotic stress. phyB operates as a dynamic switch that improves carbon balance, prioritizing light interception and photosynthetic capacity in open places and the projection of the shoot towards light in the soil, under shade and in warm conditions."

Presence of the mPHYB transgene in a wild-type genetic background causes exaggeration of this same set of phenotypic characteristics, indicating that these diverse photo-morphogenic responses are sensitive to the copy number of the PHYB gene. The transgene inserts in the Bo64(mPHYB) and WT(mPHYB) lines are shown to be single locus and single copy and the immunologically detectable level of phytochrome B is shown to vary linearly with PHYB gene copy number.

In maize (Zea mays), TB1 is a dosage-dependent inhibitor of axillary meristem progression, and the expression level of TB1 is a sensitive measure of axillary branch development. To further explore the mechanistic basis of branching, the expression of branching and cell cycle-related genes were examined in phyB-1 and wild-type sorghum axillary buds following treatment with low-red : far-red light and defoliation. Although defoliation inhibited bud outgrowth, it did not influence the expression of sorghum TB1 (SbTB1), whereas changes in SbMAX2 expression, a homolog of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) branching inhibitor MAX2, were associated with the regulation of bud outgrowth by both light and defoliation. The expression of several cell cycle-related genes was also decreased dramatically in buds repressed by defoliation, but not by phyB deficiency. The data suggest that there are at least two distinct molecular pathways that respond to light and endogenous signals to regulate axillary bud outgrowth."

Northern and southern ecotypes of black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa Torr. & Gray), for example, exhibit marked differences in the timing of short-day-induced bud set and growth cessation, and these responses are controlled by phytochrome. Therefore, as a first step toward determining the molecular genetic basis of photoperiodic ecotypes in trees, we characterized the phytochrome gene (PHY) family in black cottonwood. We recovered fragments of one PHYA and two PHYB using PCR-based cloning and by screening a genomic library. Results from Southern analyses confirmed that black cottonwood has one PHYA locus and two PHYB loci, which we arbitrarily designated PHYB1 and PHYB2. Phylogenetic analyses which included PHY from black cottonwood, Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) suggest that the PHYB/D duplications in these species occurred independently. When Southern blots were probed with PHYC, PHYE, and PHYE heterologous probes, the strongest bands that we detected were those of black cottonwood PHYA and/or PHYB. These results suggest that black cottonwood lacks members of the PHYC/F and PHYE subfamilies. Although black cottonwood could contain additional PHY that are distantly related to known angiosperm PHY, our results imply that the PHY family of black cottonwood is less complex than that of other well-characterized dicot species such as Arabidopsis and tomato. Based on Southern analyses of five black cottonwood genotypes representing three photoperiodic ecotypes, substantial polymorphism was detected for at least one of the PHYB loci but not for the PHYA locus. The novel character of the PHY family in black cottonwood, as well as the differences in polymorphism we observed between the PHYA and PHYB subfamilies, indicates that a number of fundamental macro- and microevolutionary questions remain to be answered about the PHY family in dicots."

The results show that shoot phytochrome B (phyB) triggers shoot-derived mobile ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) protein accumulation in roots, and HY5 further positively regulates transcription of strigolactone (SL) synthetic genes, thus forming a shoot phyB-dependent systemic signaling pathway that regulates the synthesis and accumulation of SLs in roots. Further experiments with carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 7 mutants and supplementary red light confirm that SLs are indispensable in the red-light-regulated mycorrhizal symbiosis in roots.

Formation of the EC depends on ELF3, a scaffold protein that recruits the other components of the EC and chromatin remodeling enzymes to repress gene expression. Regulating the cellular distribution of ELF3 is thus an important mechanism in controlling its activity. Here, we determined that the cellular and sub-nuclear localization of ELF3 is responsive to red (RL) and blue light and that these two wavelengths have apparently competitive effects on where in the cell ELF3 localizes. We further characterized the RL response, revealing that at least two RL pathways influence the cellular localization of ELF3. One of these depends on the RL photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB), while the second is at least partially independent of phyB activity. Finally, we investigated how changes in the cellular localization of ELF3 are associated with repression of EC target-gene expression.

Under red light, phyA and phyB are antagonistic, but under far-red light, followed by brief red light, phyA and phyB are synergistic in the control of seedling morphology and the expression of some genes during de-etiolation. Under short photoperiods of red and blue light, cry1 and phyB are synergistic, but under continuous exposure to the same light field the actions of phyB and cry1 become independent and additive. Phototropic bending of the shoot toward unilateral blue light is mediated by phototropin, but cry1, cry2, phyA and phyB positively regulate the response. Finally, cry2 and phyB are antagonistic in the induction of flowering. At least some of these interactions are likely to result from cross talk of the photoreceptor signaling pathways and uncover new avenues to approach signal transduction.

Little is known about the regulation of thermal reversion and how it affects plants' light sensitivity. In this study we identified several serine/threonine residues on the N-terminal extension (NTE) of Arabidopsis thaliana phyB that are differentially phosphorylated in response to light and temperature, and examined transgenic plants expressing nonphosphorylatable and phosphomimic phyB mutants. The NTE of phyB is essential for thermal stability of the Pfr form, and phosphorylation of S86 particularly enhances the thermal reversion rate of the phyB Pfr-Pr heterodimer in vivo. We demonstrate that S86 phosphorylation is especially critical for phyB signaling compared with phosphorylation of the more N-terminal residues. Interestingly, S86 phosphorylation is reduced in light, paralleled by a progressive Pfr stabilization under prolonged irradiation. By investigating other phytochromes (phyD and phyE) we provide evidence that acceleration of thermal reversion by phosphorylation represents a general mechanism for attenuating phytochrome signaling."

Upon exposure to light illumination, plants trigger a burst of molecular and physiological signaling cascades that induces not only photomorphogenic responses but also diverse adaptive behaviors. Notably, light responses and photomorphogenic traits are often associated with plant responses to other environmental cues, such as heat, cold, drought, and herbivore and pathogen attack. Growing evidence in recent years demonstrate that the red/far-red light-absorbing phytochrome (phy) photoreceptors, in particular phyB, play an essential role in plant adaptation responses to abiotic and biotic tensions by serving as a key mediator of information flow. It is also remarkable that phyB mediates the plant priming responses to numerous environmental challenges. In this minireview, we highlight recent advances on the multifaceted role of phyB during plant environmental adaptation. We also discuss the biological relevance and efficiency of the phy-mediated adaptive behaviors in potentially reducing fitness costs under unfavorable environments."

Here we show that nighttime temperatures affect the growth of the hypocotyl of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings not only during the night but also during the subsequent photoperiod. Active phytochrome B (phyB) represses nighttime growth and warm temperatures reduce active phyB via thermal reversion. The function of PHOTOPERIODIC CONTROL OF HYPOCOTYL1 (PCH1) is to stabilise active phyB in nuclear bodies but, surprisingly, warmth reduces PCH1 gene expression and PCH1 stability. When phyB was active at the beginning of the night, warm night temperatures enhanced the levels of nuclear phyB and reduced hypocotyl growth rate during the following day. However, when end-of-day far-red light minimised phyB activity, warm night temperatures reduced the levels of nuclear phyB and enhanced the hypocotyl growth rate during the following day. This complex growth pattern was absent in the phyB mutant. We propose that temperature-induced changes in the levels of PCH1 and in the size of the physiologically relevant nuclear pool of phyB amplify the impact of phyB-mediated temperature sensing."

There are five distinct phytochromes in Arabidopsis thaliana, designated phytochrome A (phyA) to phyE. phyA is light-labile and is the primary photoreceptor responsible for mediating photomorphogenic responses in FR light, whereas phyB-phyE are light stable, and phyB is the predominant phytochrome regulating de-etiolation responses in R light. Phytochromes are synthesized in the cytosol in their inactive Pr form. Upon light irradiation, phytochromes are converted to the biologically active Pfr form, and translocate into the nucleus. phyB can enter the nucleus by itself in response to R light, whereas phyA nuclear import depends on two small plant-specific proteins FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 1 (FHY1) and FHY1-LIKE (FHL). Phytochromes may function as light-regulated serine/threonine kinases, and can phosphorylate several substrates, including themselves in vitro. Phytochromes are phosphoproteins, and can be dephosphorylated by a few protein phosphatases. Photoactivated phytochromes rapidly change the expression of light-responsive genes by repressing the activity of CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting several photomorphogenesis-promoting transcription factors for degradation, and by inducing rapid phosphorylation and degradation of Phytochrome-Interacting Factors (PIFs), a group of bHLH transcription factors repressing photomorphogenesis.

This can be accounted for by the decreased response to red light (R) of the hypocotyl elongation rate in these mutants. Responses to other wavelengths are unaffected in the mutants. When grown in white light, mature hlg mutants are not elongated with respect to the wild-type; they also bolt and flower later. The shade-avoidance responses to red/far red ratio (R:FR) are intact in these mutants. Both mutants are deficient in phyB-like polypeptide that is immunodetectable in the wild-type; both have wild-type levels of a phyA-like polypeptide. These alleles are inherited in a partially dominant manner, and correspond to single-base missense mutations in a gene highly homologous to N. tabacum PHYB, which codes for a phytochrome B-type photoreceptor. One allele, hlg-1, has an introduced amino acid substitution; this may define a residue essential for phytochrome protein stability. The other allele, hlg-2, has a stop codon introduced C-terminal to the chromophore binding domain. As these phyB mutants are unaffected in shade-avoidance responses, but deficient in perception of R, it is concluded that the phyB absent in these mutants is responsible for R perception in the N. plumbaginifolia seedling, but is not a R:FR sensor in light-grown plants."

Despite the apparent association between photosynthesis and virus infection, little is known about whether there are also interplays between photomorphogenesis and plant virus resistance. Recent research suggests that plant-virus interactions are potentially regulated by several photoreceptors and photomorphogenesis regulators, including phytochromes A and B (PHYA and PHYB), cryptochromes 2 (CRY2), phototropin 2 (PHOT2), the photomorphogenesis repressor constitutive photomorphogenesis 1 (COP1), the NAM, ATAF, and CUC (NAC)-family TF ATAF2, the Aux/IAA protein phytochrome-associated protein 1 (PAP1), the homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) TF HAT1, and the core circadian clock component circadian clock associated 1 (CCA1).

Recently, the 651-amino acid photosensory domain of phytochrome B (phyB) has been shown to act as a functional photoreceptor in the nucleus. The phytochrome (PHY) domain, which is located at the C-terminal end of the photosensory domain, is required for the spectral integrity of phytochrome; however, little is known about the signal transduction activity of this domain. Here, we have established transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing an N-terminal 450-amino acid fragment of phyB (N450) lacking the PHY domain on a phyB-deficient background. Analysis of these plants revealed that N450 can act as an active photoreceptor when attached to a short nuclear localization signal and beta-glucuronidase. In vitro spectral analysis of reconstituted chromopeptides further indicated that the stability of the N450 Pfr form, an active form of phytochrome, is markedly reduced in comparison with the Pfr form of full-length phyB. Consistent with this, plants expressing N450 failed to respond to intermittent light applied at long intervals, indicating that N450 Pfr is short-lived in vivo. Taken together, our findings show that the PHY domain is dispensable for phyB signal transduction but is required for stabilizing the Pfr form of phyB."

However, the mechanisms underlying the signal-relay process are still not fully understood. Here, using mass spectrometry, we identify multiple, in vivo, light-induced Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites in PIF3. Using transgenic expression of site-directed mutants of PIF3, we provide evidence that a set of these phosphorylation events acts collectively to trigger rapid degradation of the PIF3 protein in response to initial exposure of dark-grown seedlings to light. In addition, we show that phyB-induced PIF3 phosphorylation is also required for the known negative feedback modulation of phyB levels in prolonged light, potentially through codegradation of phyB and PIF3. This mutually regulatory intermolecular transaction thus provides a mechanism with the dual capacity to promote early, graded, or threshold regulation of the primary, PIF3-controlled transcriptional network in response to initial light exposure, and later, to attenuate global sensitivity to the light signal through reductions in photoreceptor levels upon prolonged exposure."

It includes the phytochrome system comprising phytochromes A and B (phyA and phyB) as the major components. phyA differs from phyB by several properties, including its ability to mediate all three photoresponse modes - the very low and low fluence responses (VLFR and LFR respectively) and the high irradiance responses (HIR), whereas phyB is responsible for LFR. This review discusses the uniqueness of phyA in terms of its structural and functional heterogeneity. The photoreceptor is presented in monocots and dicots by two native molecular species, phyA' and phyA'', differing by spectroscopic, photochemical and phenomenological properties. phyA differentiation into substates includes post-translational phosphorylation of a serine residue(s) at the N-terminal extension of the molecule with phyA' being the phosphorylated species and phyA'', dephosphorylated. They differ also by their mode of action, which depends on the cellular context. The current working hypothesis is that phyA' mediates VLFR and phyA'', HIR and LFR. The content and functional activity of the two pools are regulated by light and by phosphatase/kinase equilibrium and pH in darkness, what contributes to the fine-tuning of the phytochrome system. Detection of the native pools of the cryptogamic plant fern Adiantum capillus-veneris phy1 (phy1' and phy1'') similar to those of phyA suggests that the structural and functional heterogeneity of phyA is not a unique phenomenon and may have arisen earlier in the molecular evolution of the phytochrome system than the appearance of the angiosperm phytochromes."

To identify SFPS-interacting proteins, we performed an immunoprecipitation followed by a mass spectrometry and identified the Ser/Arg-like protein REDUCED RED-LIGHT RESPONSES IN CRY1CRY2 BACKGROUND1 (RRC1).

Although crosstalk between light signaling and ER stress response has been reported in plants, the molecular mechanisms underlying this crosstalk are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB) induces the expression of ER luminal protein chaperones as well as that of unfolded protein response (UPR) genes. The phyB-5 mutant was less sensitive to tunicamycin (TM)-induced ER stress than were the wild-type plants, whereas phyB-overexpressing plants displayed a more sensitive phenotype under white light conditions. ER stress response genes (BiP2 and BiP3), UPR-related bZIP transcription factors (bZIP17, bZIP28, and bZIP60), and programmed cell death (PCD)-associated genes (OXI1, NRP1, and MC8) were upregulated in phyB-overexpressing plants, but not in phyB-5, under ER stress conditions. The ER stress-sensitive phenotype of phyB-5 under red light conditions was eliminated with a reduction in photo-equilibrium by far-red light and darkness. The N-terminal domain of phyB is essential for signal transduction of the ER stress response in the nucleus, which is similar to light signaling.

This phyA specificity is determined at the level of (i) intramolecular events, (ii) turnover, phyA being light-labile, and (iii) nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning and interaction with partner proteins. A unique feature of phyA is that two native isoforms, phyA' and phyA'', comprise it, distinguished by spectroscopic and photochemical properties, localization and abundance in plant tissues, light stability, and other properties. They differ by the post-translational modification at the 6 kDa N-terminus, possibly phosphorylation, phyA' being phosphorylated and phyA'' dephosphorylated. Both species participate in the light-induced nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning. The light-labile phyA' is responsible for de-etiolation (VLFR and HIR modes), whereas the relatively more light-stable phyA'' could be active throughout the whole life cycle. PhyA'' interferes with the action of phyA' and this interaction may be part of the fine tuning mechanism of the phyA function. Finally, within the phyA' pool there are different conformers in thermal equilibrium, that differ by the activation and kinetic parameters of the Pr-->lumi-R photoreaction.

Downstream of phyB, the signalling core comprises two branches, one involving PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) and the other CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5). The dynamics of accumulation and/or localization of each of these core signalling components depend on light and temperature conditions. These pathways are connected through COP1, which enhances the activity of PIF4. The circadian clock modulates this circuit, since EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3), an essential component of the evening complex (EC), represses expression of the PIF4 gene and PIF4 transcriptional activity. Phytochromes are probably not the only entry point of temperature into this network, but other sensors remain to be established. The sharing of mechanisms of action for two distinct environmental cues is to some extent unexpected, as it renders these responses mutually dependent. There are nonetheless many ecological contexts in which such a mutual influence could be beneficial."

In our experiments, red light treatment led to nuclear translocation of phyA-GFP and phyB-GFP, albeit with different kinetics. Red light-induced nuclear import of phyB-GFP, but not that of phyA-GFP, was inhibited by far-red light. Far-red light alone only induced nuclear translocation of phyA-GFP. These observations indicate that nuclear import of phyA-GFP is controlled by a very low fluence response, whereas translocation of phyB-GFP is regulated by a low fluence response of phytochrome.

Plant immune responses are orchestrated by two key hormones: jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA). Recent work has demonstrated that for plants of shade-intolerant species, which include the majority of those grown as grain crops, light is a major modulator of defense responses. Light signals that indicate proximity of competitors, such as a low red to far-red (R:FR) ratio, down-regulate the expression of JA- and SA-induced immune responses against pests and pathogens. This down-regulation of defense under low R:FR ratios, which is caused by the photoconversion of the photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB) to an inactive state, is likely to help the plant to efficiently redirect resources to rapid growth when the competition threat posed by neighboring plants is high. This review is focused on the molecular mechanisms that link phyB with defense signaling. In particular, we discuss novel signaling players that are likely to play a role in the repression of defense responses under low R:FR ratios. A better understanding of the molecular connections between photoreceptors and the hormonal regulation of plant immunity will provide a functional framework to understand the mechanisms used by plants to deal with fundamental resource allocation trade-offs under dynamic conditions of biotic stress."

Phytochromes are synthesized in the cytoplasm, and light induces translocation of the Pfr conformer into the nucleus. Nuclear import of phytochromes is a highly regulated process and is fine-tuned by the quality and quantity of light. It appears that phytochrome A (phyA) and phytochrome B (phyB) do not possess active endogenous nuclear import signals (NLSs), thus light-induced translocation of these photoreceptors into the nucleus requires direct protein–protein interactions with their NLS-containing signaling partners. Sub-cellular partitioning of the various phytochrome species is mediated by different molecular machineries. Translocation of phyA into the nucleus is promoted by FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 1 (FHY1) and FHY1-LIKE (FHL), but the identity of nuclear transport facilitators mediating the import of phyB-E into the nucleus remains elusive. Phytochromes localized in the nucleus are associated with specific protein complexes, termed photobodies. The size and distribution of these structures are regulated by the intensity and duration of irradiation, and circumstantial evidence indicates that they are involved in fine-tuning phytochrome signaling."

Here we report temperature-dependent photobody localization of fluorescent protein-tagged phyB (phyB-FP) in the epidermal cells of Arabidopsis hypocotyl and cotyledon. Our results demonstrate that warm temperature elicits different photobody dynamics than those by shade. Increases in temperature from 12 °C to 27 °C incrementally reduce photobody number by stimulating phyB-FP disassembly from selective thermo-unstable photobodies. The thermostability of photobodies relies on phyB's photosensory module. Surprisingly, elevated temperatures inflict opposite effects on phyB's functions in the hypocotyl and cotyledon despite inducing similar photobody dynamics, indicative of tissue/organ-specific temperature signaling circuitry either downstream of photobody dynamics or independent of phyB. Our results thus provide direct cell biology evidence supporting an early temperature signaling mechanism via dynamic assembly/disassembly of individual photobodies possessing distinct thermostabilities."

At the molecular level, phyB interacts in a conformation-dependent fashion with a battery of downstream regulatory proteins, including PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR transcription factors, and by modulating their activity/abundance, it alters expression patterns of genes underlying photomorphogenesis. Here we report that the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is conjugated (SUMOylation) to the C terminus of phyB; the accumulation of SUMOylated phyB is enhanced by red light and displays a diurnal pattern in plants grown under light/dark cycles. Our data demonstrate that (i) transgenic plants expressing the mutant phyB(Lys996Arg)-YFP photoreceptor are hypersensitive to red light, (ii) light-induced SUMOylation of the mutant phyB is drastically decreased compared with phyB-YFP, and (iii) SUMOylation of phyB inhibits binding of PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 5 to phyB Pfr. In addition, we show that OVERLY TOLERANT TO SALT 1 (OTS1) de-SUMOylates phyB in vitro, it interacts with phyB in vivo, and the ots1/ots2 mutant is hyposensitive to red light.

While phyC, D, and E are absent from at least some taxa, phyA and phyB are present in all sampled seed plants and are the principal mediators of red/far-red-induced responses.

Endodermis-specific expression of PIF1 rescues gravitropism in pifQ mutant seedlings. Since phytochromes induce light responses by inhibiting PIFs and the COP1-SPA ubiquitin E3 ligase complex in the nucleus, we asked whether phyB can cell autonomously inhibit hypocotyl negative gravitropism in the endodermis. We found that while epidermis-specific expression of PHYB rescues hypocotyl negative gravitropism and all other phyB mutant phenotypes, endodermis-specific expression of PHYB does not. Epidermal phyB induces the phosphorylation and degradation of endodermal PIFs in response to red light. This induces a global gene expression pattern similar to that induced by red light treatment of seedlings expressing PHYB under the control of its own endogenous promoter.

The gross phenotypes observed in mutants of the SUMO conjugation and deconjugation enzymes reflect these essential roles, and detailed analyses of these mutants under different growth conditions revealed roles in biotic and abiotic stress responses, phosphate starvation, nitrate and sulphur metabolism, freezing and drought tolerance and response to excess copper. SUMO functions also intersect with those regulated by several hormones such as salicylic acid , abscisic acid , gibberellins and auxin, and detailed studies provide mechanistic clues of how sumoylation may regulate these processes. The regulation of COP1 and PhyB functions by sumoylation provides very strong evidence that SUMO is heavily involved in the regulation of light signaling in plants. At the cellular and subcellular levels, SUMO regulates meristem architecture, the switch from the mitotic cycle into the endocycle, meiosis, centromere decondensation and exit from mitosis, transcriptional control, and release from transcriptional silencing. Most of these advances in our understanding of SUMO functions during plant development emerged over the past 6-7 years, and they may only predict a prominent rise of SUMO as a major regulator of eukaryotic cellular and organismal growth and development."

Our objective was to determine if the pH optima of PhyB could be broadened to a more characteristic pH range in the stomach of young animals through site-directed mutagenesis. We created two mutants, E272K and E272Q, each with a single amino acid substitution of the same residue in the substrate specificity site. Mutants were designed to replace an acidic amino acid, with either a neutral amino acid (E272Q) or basic amino acid (E272K), and were overexpressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. While the wild-type (WT) pH optimum was 2.5, mutant E272K shifted to a new optimum of pH 3.2. E272K had a concomitant reduction in K (m) of 36-fold at pH 2.5 and 6-fold at pH 3.2 compared to the WT.

The onset of leaf senescence is coordinately modulated by intrinsic aging programs and environmental conditions, such as prolonged darkness and temperature extremes. Seedlings growing under light deprivation, as often experienced in severe shading or night darkening, exhibit an accelerated senescing process, which is mediated by a complex signaling network that includes sugar starvation responses and light signaling events via the phytochrome B (phyB)-PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR (PIF) signaling routes. Notably, recent studies indicate that nonstressful ambient temperatures profoundly influence the onset and progression of leaf senescence in darkness, presumably mediated by the phyB-PIF4 signaling pathways. However, it is not fully understood how temperature signals regulate leaf senescence at the molecular level. Here, we demonstrated that low ambient temperatures repress the nuclear export of phyB and the nuclear phyB suppresses the transcriptional activation activity of ethylene signaling mediator ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3), thus delaying leaf senescence. Accordingly, leaf senescence was insensitive to low ambient temperatures in transgenic plants overexpressing a constitutively nuclear phyB form, as observed in ein3 eil1 mutants. In contrast, leaf senescence was significantly promoted in phyB-deficient mutants under identical temperature conditions. Our data indicate that phyB coordinately integrates light and temperature cues into the EIN3-mediated ethylene signaling pathway that regulates leaf senescence under light deprivation, which would enhance plant fitness under fluctuating natural environments."

Genetic combinations of idd10 and phy mutants demonstrated that phyB, but not phyA or phyC, suppressed NH4 + -sensitive root growth of idd10. PhyB mutants and PhyB overexpressors (PhyB OXs) accumulated more and less NH4 + , respectively, compared with wild-type plants.

AMT1 RNAi plants with suppressed AMT1;1, AMT1;2, and AMT1;3 expression exhibited shorter primary roots under NH4 + conditions. This suggested that NH4 + uptake might be positively associated with root growth. Further, PhyB interacted with and inhibited IDD10 and brassinazole-resistant 1 (BZR1). IDD10 interacted with BZR1 to activate AMT1;2. NH4 + uptake is known to promote resistance of rice (Oryza sativa) to sheath blight (ShB) and saline-alkaline stress. Inoculation of Rhizoctonia solani demonstrated that PhyB and IDD10 negatively regulated and AMT1 and BZR1 positively regulated resistance of rice to ShB. In addition, PhyB negatively regulated and IDD10 and AMT1 positively regulated resistance of rice to saline-alkaline stress. This suggested that PhyB-IDD10-AMT1;2 signaling regulates the saline-alkaline response, whereas the PhyB-BZR1-AMT1;2 pathway modulates ShB resistance.

The activity of phytochrome in the field has typically been described by its photoequilibrium, defined by the photochemical properties of the pigment in combination with the spectral distribution of the light. This approach represents an oversimplification because phytochrome B (phyB) activity depends not only on its photochemical reactions but also on its rates of synthesis, degradation, translocation to the nucleus, and thermal reversion. To account for these complex cellular reactions, we used a model to simulate phyB activity under a range of field conditions. The model provided values of phyB activity that in turn predicted hypocotyl growth in the field with reasonable accuracy. On the basis of these observations, we define two scenarios, one is under shade, in cloudy weather, at the extremes of the photoperiod or in the presence of rapid fluctuations of the light environment caused by wind-induced movements of the foliage, where phyB activity departs from photoequilibrium and becomes affected by irradiance and temperature in addition to the spectral distribution. The other scenario is under full sunlight, where phyB activity responds mainly to the spectral distribution of the light."

The phyB polypeptide is folded into two domains, the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain covalently binds to the chromophore via a particular cysteine residue, which allows the holoprotein to absorb light and undergo a photoreversible conformational change. The N-terminal domain of phyB interacts with transcription factors, such as PIF3 (PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 3), to transduce the light signal to downstream components. Since substitution of the chromophore attachment site, Cys357, with alanine (C357A) abolishes the biological activity of Arabidopsis phyB, the covalent attachment with the chromophore is widely assumed to be necessary for phyB signal transduction. In this study, we show that Arabidopsis phyB is capable of transducing signals with a non-covalently retained chromophore. Substituting the Tyr276 residue of phyB with histidine (Y276H) is known to confer constitutive phyB signaling. PhyB containing both Y276H and C357A substitutions exhibited light-independent biological activity in transgenic Arabidopsis plants in a chromophore-dependent manner. Spectrophotometric analysis showed that the N-terminal domain of phyB containing just the C357A substitution could retain the chromophore non-covalently. The N-terminal domain containing both the Y276H and C357A substitutions interacted with PIF3 in a light-independent but chromophore-dependent fashion in yeast two-hybrid assays. From these results, we conclude that the constitutive phyB signaling conferred by Y276H requires the chromophore, but that the chromophore does not need to be covalently bonded to phyB."

Here, we show that the transposase-derived transcription factor FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL3 (FHY3) inhibits seed dormancy and promotes phyB-mediated seed germination in Arabidopsis thaliana. FHY3 physically interacts with phyB in vitro and in vivo. RNA-sequencing and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that FHY3 regulates multiple downstream genes, including REVEILLE2 (RVE2), RVE7, and SPATULA (SPT). Yeast one-hybrid, electrophoresis mobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that FHY3 directly binds these genes via a conserved FBS cis-element in their promoters. Furthermore, RVE2, RVE7, and GIBBERELLIN 3-OXIDASE 2 (GA3ox2) genetically act downstream of FHY3. Strikingly, light and phyB promote FHY3 protein accumulation.

PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR3 (PIF3) is an extensively studied transcription factor repressing photomorphogenesis, and it is well-established that upon red (R) light exposure, photo-activated phytochrome B (phyB) interacts with PIF3 and induces its rapid phosphorylation and degradation.

In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), neighbour cues reduce the activity of the photo-sensory receptors phytochrome B (phyB) and cryptochrome 1 (cry1), releasing photoreceptor repression imposed on PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs) and leading to transcriptional reprogramming. The phyB-PIF hub is at the core of all shade-avoidance responses, whilst other photo-sensory receptors and transcription factors contribute in a context-specific manner. CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) is a master regulator of this hub, indirectly stabilising PIFs and targeting negative regulators of shade avoidance for degradation. Warm temperatures reduce the activity of phyB, which operates as a temperature sensor, and further increases the activities of PIF4 and PIF7 by independent temperature sensing mechanisms. The signalling network controlling shade avoidance is not buffered against climate change; rather, it integrates information about shade, temperature, salinity, drought, and likely flooding. We therefore predict that climate change will exacerbate shade-induced growth responses in some regions of the planet while limiting the growth potential in others."

In Arabidopsis, phytochrome B (phyB); phyA; cryptochrome 2; and flavin-binding, KELCH repeat, F-BOX 1 are major photoreceptors that regulate flowering. Unlike phyA; cryptochrome 2; and flavin-binding, KELCH repeat, F-BOX 1, phyB delays flowering mainly by destabilizing the CONSTANS (CO) protein, whose reduction leads to decreased expression of a florigen gene, flowering locus T. However, it remains unclear how the phyB-mediated CO destabilization is mechanistically regulated. Here, we identify a unique phytochrome-dependent late-flowering (PHL) gene, which is mainly involved in the phyB-dependent regulation of flowering. Plants with mutant phl exhibited a late-flowering phenotype, especially under long-day conditions. The late-flowering phenotype of the phl mutant was completely overridden by a phyB mutation, indicating that PHL normally accelerates flowering by countering the inhibitory effect of phyB on flowering. Accordingly, PHL physically interacted with phyB both in vitro and in vivo in a red light-dependent manner. Furthermore, in the presence of phyB under red light, PHL interacted with CO as well. Taken together, we propose that PHL regulates photoperiodic flowering by forming a phyB-PHL-CO tripartite complex."

First, four genes responsible for PCB synthesis, namely, PcyA, HO1, Fd, and Fnr, were replaced with their counterparts derived from thermophilic cyanobacteria. Second, Fnr was truncated, followed by fusion with Fd to generate a chimeric protein, tFnr-Fd. Third, these genes were concatenated with P2A peptide cDNAs for polycistronic expression, resulting in an approximately 4-fold increase in PCB synthesis compared with the previous version. Finally, we incorporated the PhyB, PIF, and SynPCB system into drug inducible lentiviral and transposon vectors, which enabled us to induce PCB synthesis and the PhyB-PIF LID system by doxycycline treatment.

HT suppresses seed germination and triggers protein S-nitrosylation. Here, we find that HT suppresses seed germination by inducing the S-nitrosylation of HFR1 at C164, resulting in its degradation, the release of PIF1, and the activation of PIF1-targeted SOMNUS (SOM) expression to alter gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) metabolism. Active phyB (phyBY276H ) antagonizes HFR1 S-nitrosylation and degradation by increasing S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) activity. In line with this, substituting cysteine-164 of HFR1 with serine (HFR1C164S ) abolishes the S-nitrosylation of HFR1 and decreases the HT-induced degradation of HFR1. Taken together, our study suggests that HT and phyB antagonistically modulate the S-nitrosylation level of HFR1 to coordinate seed germination, and provides the possibility to enhance seed thermotolerance through gene-editing of HFR1."

Transgenic Arabidopsis plants were produced with expressed a fusion protein consisting of GUS and C-terminal fragments of phyB. GUS staining from the fusion protein in these transgenic plants was observed in the nucleus, which suggests that the nuclear localization signal of the fragment is functional. Next, it was examined whether the endogenous phyB was detected in the nucleus. Nuclei were isolated from the light-grown wild-type Arabidopsis leaves and subjected to the immunoblot analysis. The result indicated that a substantial fraction of total phyB was recovered in the isolated nuclei. This result was further confirmed by the immunocytochemical analysis of the protoplasts. Finally, the effects of light treatments on the levels of phyB in the isolated nuclei were examined. Dark adaptation of the plants before the nuclear isolation reduced the levels of phyB. The reduction was accelerated by irradiation of plants with far-red light before the transfer to darkness. Thus, nuclear localization of phyB was suggested to be light-dependent."

Endogenous phyB, but not phytochrome D (phyD), partly suppressed phytochrome A (phyA)-dependent inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in far-red light (FR). Dichromatic irradiation demonstrated that the negative effect of phyB was largely independent of the photoequilibrium, i.e. far-red light absorbing form of phytochrome formation. Moreover, phyB-4, a mutant impaired in signal transduction, did not show a loss of inhibition of phyA by phyB. Overexpression of phyB, conversely, resulted in an enhanced inhibition of phyA function, even in the absence of supplementary carbohydrates. However, overexpression of a mutated phyB, which cannot incorporate the chromophore, had no detectable effect on phyA action. In addition to seedling growth, accumulation of anthocyanins in FR, another manifestation of the high irradiance response, was strongly influenced by phyB holoprotein. Induction of seed germination by FR, a very low fluence response, was suppressed by both endogenous phyB and phyD. In conclusion, we show that both classical response modes of phyA, high irradiance response, and very low fluence response are subject to an inhibitory action of phyB-like phytochromes.

However, whether phytochrome B (phyB) is involved in red light regulation of stomatal opening remains largely unclear.

In addition, stomata of the cry1 cry2 phyB, phot1 phot2 phyB, and cry1 phyA phyB triple mutant plants showed more reduced light response than those of the single or double mutant plants under white light, implying that phyB acts in concert with phyA, CRY, and PHOT in light regulation of stomatal opening. Stomata of phyB cop1 mutant opened less wide than those of the cop1 mutant, and stomata of the pif3 pif4 mutant opened wider than those of the wild-type, indicating that COP1, together with the PIFs (phytochrome interacting factors), may act downstream of PHYB in regulating stomatal opening.

Vegetation-induced reduction in the red light:far-red light ratio provides a competition signal sensed by phytochromes. Plants deficient in phytochrome B (phyB) exhibit a constitutive shade avoidance syndrome including reduced branching. Because auxin in the polar auxin transport stream (PATS) inhibits axillary bud outgrowth, its role in regulating the phyB branching phenotype was tested. Removing the main shoot PATS auxin source by decapitation or chemically inhibiting the PATS strongly stimulated branching in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) deficient in phyB, but had a modest effect in the wild type. Whereas indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels were elevated in young phyB seedlings, there was less IAA in mature stems compared with the wild type. A split plate assay of bud outgrowth kinetics indicated that low auxin levels inhibited phyB buds more than the wild type. Because the auxin response could be a result of either the auxin signaling status or the bud's ability to export auxin into the main shoot PATS, both parameters were assessed. Main shoots of phyB had less absolute auxin transport capacity compared with the wild type, but equal or greater capacity when based on the relative amounts of native IAA in the stems. Thus, auxin transport capacity was unlikely to restrict branching. Both shoots of young phyB seedlings and mature stem segments showed elevated expression of auxin-responsive genes and expression was further increased by auxin treatment, suggesting that phyB suppresses auxin signaling to promote branching."

Nipponbare). To understand the underlying mechanism by which phyB regulates drought tolerance, we analyzed root growth and water loss from the leaves of phyB mutants. The root system showed no significant difference between the phyB mutants and WT, suggesting that improved drought tolerance has little relation to root growth. However, phyB mutants exhibited reduced total leaf area per plant, which was probably due to a reduction in the total number of cells per leaf caused by enhanced expression of Orysa;KRP1 and Orysa;KRP4 (encoding inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase complex activity) in the phyB mutants. In addition, the developed leaves of phyB mutants displayed larger epidermal cells than WT leaves, resulting in reduced stomatal density. phyB deficiency promoted the expression of both putative ERECTA family genes and EXPANSIN family genes involved in cell expansion in leaves, thus causing greater epidermal cell expansion in the phyB mutants. Reduced stomatal density resulted in reduced transpiration per unit leaf area in the phyB mutants. Considering all these findings, we propose that phyB deficiency causes both reduced total leaf area and reduced transpiration per unit leaf area, which explains the reduced water loss and improved drought tolerance of phyB mutants."

Light also regulates stomatal development systemically, with the irradiance perceived by mature leaves modulating stomatal development in young leaves [6, 7].

Activated phyB inhibits PIF3 by rapid protein degradation and decreased transcription. PIF3 protein degradation is mediated by EIN3-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (EBF) and LIGHT-RESPONSE BTB (LRB) E3 ligases, the latter of which simultaneously targets phyB for degradation. In this study, we show that PIF3 levels are additionally regulated by alternative splicing and protein translation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Overaccumulation of photo-activated phyB, which occurs in the mutant defective for LRB genes under continuous red light, induces a specific alternative splicing of PIF3 that results in retention of an intron in the 5' untranslated region of PIF3 mRNA. In turn, the upstream open reading frames contained within this intron inhibit PIF3 protein synthesis. The phyB-dependent alternative splicing of PIF3 is diurnally regulated under the short-day light cycle. We hypothesize that this reversible regulatory mechanism may be utilized to fine tune the level of PIF3 protein in light-grown plants and may contribute to the oscillation of PIF3 protein abundance under the short-day environment."

The interaction between PIF3 and photoactivated phyB leads to the rapid phosphorylation and degradation of PIF3 and also to the degradation of phyB, events which are required for proper photomorphogenesis. Here we report that PIF3 is SUMOylated at the Lys13 (K13) residue and that we could detect this posttranslational modification in a heterologous experimental system and also in planta. We also found that the SUMO acceptor site mutant PIF3(K13R) binds more strongly to the target promoters than its SUMOylated, wild-type counterpart. Seedlings expressing PIF3(K13R) show an elongated hypocotyl response, elevated photoprotection and higher transcriptional induction of red-light responsive genes compared with plantlets expressing wild-type PIF3. These observations are supported by the lower level of phyB in plants which possess only PIF3(K13R), indicating that SUMOylation of PIF3 also alters photomorphogenesis via the regulation of phyB levels. In conclusion, whereas SUMOylation is generally connected to different stress responses, it also fine-tunes light signalling by reducing the biological activity of PIF3, thus promoting photomorphogenesis."

This behaviour alleviates stressful conditions generated by an excess of light, but increases the chances of desiccation. Here we evaluated how phyB modulates this drought-tolerance response by comparing wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana adult plants to the null phyB in response to water shortage. phyB wilted before the wild type, and this was due to phyB maintaining open stomata under a reduction in soil water availability. Although phyB presented enhanced ABA levels under well-watered conditions, this mutant was less sensitive than the wild type in diminishing stomatal conductance in response to exogenous ABA application. Reduced sensitivity to ABA in phyB correlated with a lower expression of ABCG22, which encodes a putative ABA influx transporter, and PYL5, which encodes a soluble ABA receptor. Furthermore, the expression of RAB18 and RD29A, both typical ABA-induced genes, was lower in phyB than the wild type after ABA treatment. We propose that phyB contributes to the acclimation of plants to open environments by enhancing ABA sensitivity when soil water becomes limiting."

H2A.Z is an evolutionarily conserved H2A variant which plays essential roles in transcriptional regulation. The replacement of H2A with H2A.Z is catalyzed by the SWR1 complex. Here, we show that the Pfr form of phyB physically interacts with the SWR1 complex subunits SWC6 and ARP6. phyB and ARP6 co-regulate numerous genes in the same direction, some of which are associated with auxin biosynthesis and response including YUC9, which encodes a rate-limiting enzyme in the tryptophan-dependent auxin biosynthesis pathway. Moreover, phyB and HY5/HYH act to inhibit hypocotyl elongation partially through repression of auxin biosynthesis. Based on our findings and previous studies, we propose that phyB promotes H2A.Z deposition at YUC9 to inhibit its expression through direct phyB-SWC6/ARP6 interactions, leading to repression of auxin biosynthesis, and thus inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in red light."

Here, we demonstrate that HLS1 protein is present as an oligomer in the nucleus of dark-grown seedlings. Oligomerization is required for HLS1 activation, as the mutated HLS1 protein abolishing self-association exists as nonfunctional monomers. Upon light exposure, photoreceptor phyB translocates into the nucleus and interacts with HLS1, disrupting the self-association and oligomerization of HLS1 to initiate hook unfolding. Remarkably, genetic expression of nuclear-localized phyB is sufficient to inactivate HLS1, resulting in compromised hook curvature in etiolated seedlings. Together, we conclude that HLS1 protein is active as oligomeric form in darkness and achieves allosteric photo-deactivation upon light, providing intriguing mechanistic insight into the molecular switch for developmental transition."

We also identified a point mutation in the phyB C-terminal domain, which, when combined with a deletion of the C-terminal end (phyB990G767R), does the opposite; it blocks PIF degradation without affecting PIF sequestration. The resulting phyB proteins, phyB990G767R and phyBG111D, are equally capable of inducing light responses under continuous red light. However, phyBG111D, which exhibits only the PIF degradation activity, induces stronger light responses than phyB990G767R under white light with prolonged dark periods (i.e., diurnal cycles). In contrast, phyB990G767R, which exhibits only the PIF sequestration activity, induces stronger light responses in flickering light (a condition that mimics sunflecks).

Analysis of phyB-9 transgenic plants expressing phospho-mimic and nonphosphorylatable phyB-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusions demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser-86 negatively regulates all physiological responses tested. The Ser86Asp and Ser86Ala substitutions do not affect stability, photoconversion, and spectral properties of the photoreceptor, but light-independent relaxation of the phyB(Ser86Asp) Pfr into Pr, also termed dark reversion, is strongly enhanced both in vivo and in vitro. Faster dark reversion attenuates red light-induced nuclear import and interaction of phyB(Ser86Asp)-YFP Pfr with the negative regulator PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3 compared with phyB-green fluorescent protein.

However, the role of phyB in FR light signaling and the regulatory pathway from light-activated phytochromes to the COP1-SPA1 complex are largely unknown. Here, we confirm that PHYB overexpression causes an etiolation response with reduced ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) accumulation under FR light. Notably, phyB exerts its nuclear activities and promotes seedling etiolation in both the presence and absence of phyA in response to FR light. PhyB acts upstream of SPA1 and is functionally dependent on it in FR light signaling. PhyB interacts and forms a protein complex with SPA1, enhancing its nuclear accumulation under FR light. During the dark-to-FR transition, phyB is rapidly imported into the nucleus and facilitates nuclear SPA1 accumulation.

Toward this goal, photoregulating the cargo integration and release in bacteriabots using red and far-red light, which are noninvasive stimuli with good tissue penetration and provide high spatiotemporal control, is proposed. In the bacteriabot design, the surfaces of E. coli and microsized model cargo particles with the proteins PhyB and PIF6, which bind to each other under red light and dissociate from each other under far-red light are functionalized.

Surprisingly, the interaction is light-dissociated; CRY1 interacts specifically with the dark/far-red (Pr) state of phyB, but not with the red light-activated (Pfr) or the chromophore unconjugated form of the enzyme. The interaction is also regulated by light activation of CRY1; phyB Pr interacts only with the unstimulated form of CRY1 but not with the photostimulated protein.

Here, we report the molecular structure of Arabidopsis thaliana phyB in Pr form and the molecular properties of the Pfr form determined by small-angle X-ray scattering coupled with size-exclusion chromatography. In solution, the Pr form associated as a dimer with a radius of gyration of 50 Å. The molecular shape was a crossed shape, in which the orientation of the photosensory modules differed from that in the crystal structure of dimeric photosensory module. PhyB exhibited structural reversibility in the Pfr-to-Pr phototransformation and thermal reversion from Pfr to Pr in the dark. In addition, Pfr only exhibited nonspecific association, which distinguished molecular properties of Pfr form from those of the inactive Pr form."

This temporal organization enhances the fitness of plants only if it corresponds to the natural day/night cycles. Light, absorbed by photoreceptors, is the most effective signal in synchronizing the oscillator to environmental cycles. Phytochrome B (PHYB) is the major red/far-red light-absorbing phytochrome receptor in light-grown plants. Besides modulating the pace and phase of the circadian clock, PHYB controls photomorphogenesis and delays flowering. It has been demonstrated that the nuclear-localized amino-terminal domain of PHYB is capable of controlling photomorphogenesis and, partly, flowering. Here, we show (1) that PHYB derivatives containing 651 or 450 amino acid residues of the amino-terminal domains are functional in mediating red light signaling to the clock, (2) that circadian entrainment is a nuclear function of PHYB, and (3) that a 410-amino acid amino-terminal fragment does not possess any functions of PHYB due to impaired chromophore binding. However, we provide evidence that the carboxyl-terminal domain is required to mediate entrainment in white light, suggesting a role for this domain in integrating red and blue light signaling to the clock. Moreover, careful analysis of the circadian phenotype of phyB-9 indicates that PHYB provides light signaling for different regulatory loops of the circadian oscillator in a different manner, which results in an apparent decoupling of the loops in the absence of PHYB under specific light conditions."

While the initial steps in Pfr signaling are unclear, an early event for the phyB isoform after photoconversion is its redistribution from the cytoplasm into subnuclear foci known as photobodies (PBs), which dissipate after Pfr reverts back to Pr by far-red irradiation or by temperature-dependent nonphotochemical reversion. Here we present evidence that PHOTOPERIODIC CONTROL OF HYPOCOTYL 1 (PCH1) functions both as an essential structural component of phyB-containing PBs and as a direct regulator of thermal reversion that is sufficient to stabilize phyB as Pfr in vitro. By examining the genetic interaction between a constitutively active phyBY276H-YFP allele (YHB-YFP) and PCH1, we show that the loss of PCH1 prevents YHB from coalescing into PBs without affecting its nuclear localization, whereas overexpression of PCH1 dramatically increases PB levels. Loss of PCH1, presumably by impacting phyB-PB assembly, compromises a number of events elicited in YHB-YFP plants, including their constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype, red light-regulated thermomorphogenesis, and input of phyB into the circadian clock. Conversely, elevated levels of both phyB and PCH1 generate stable, yet far-red light-reversible PBs that persisted for days. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the assembly of PCH1-containing PBs is critical for phyB signaling to multiple outputs and suggest that altering PB dynamics could be exploited to modulate plant responses to light and temperature."

As the primary photosynthetic organs, leaves have a laminar structure in many dicotyledonous plants. The regulation of leaf flatness is a key mechanism for the efficient absorption of light under low light conditions. In the present study, we demonstrated that phytochrome B (phyB) promoted the development of curled leaves. Wild-type leaves gently curled downwards under white light, whereas the phyB-deficient mutant (phyB) constitutively exhibited flatter leaves. In the wild type, leaf flattening was promoted by end-of-day far-red light (EODFR) treatment, which rapidly eliminates the active Pfr phytochrome. Interestingly, the curled-leaf phenotype in a phototropin-deficient mutant was almost completely suppressed by the phyB mutation as well as by EODFR. Thus, phototropin promotes leaf flattening by suppressing the leaf-curling activity of phyB. We examined the downstream components of phyB and phototropin to assess their antagonistic regulation of leaf flatness further. Consequently, we found that a phototropin signaling transducer, NON-PHOTOTROPIC HYPOCOTYL 3 (NPH3), was required to promote leaf flattening in phyB. The present study provides new insights into a mechanism in which leaf flatness is regulated in response to different light environmental cues."

In Arabidopsis, light-dependent stabilization of the rhythmically expressed CONSTANS (CO) is required for the activation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), resulting in the initiation of flowering. Phytochrome A and cryptochrome photoreceptors stabilize CO in the evening by attenuating the activity of the CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1-SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 1 (COP1-SPA1) ubiquitin ligase complex, which promotes turnover of CO. In contrast, phytochrome B (phyB) facilitates degradation of CO in the morning and delays flowering. Accordingly, flowering is accelerated in phyB mutants. Paradoxically, plants overexpressing phyB also show early flowering, which may arise from an early phase of rhythmic CO expression. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of phyB induces FT transcription at dusk and in the night without affecting the phase or level of CO transcription. This response depends on the light-activated Pfr form of phyB that inhibits the function of the COP1-SPA1 complex by direct interactions. Our data suggest that attenuation of COP1 activity results in the accumulation of CO protein and subsequent induction of FT. We show that phosphorylation of Ser-86 inhibits this function of phyB by accelerating dark reversion and thus depletion of Pfr forms in the night. Our results explain the early flowering phenotype of phyB overexpression and reveal additional features of the molecular machinery by which photoreceptors mediate photoperiodism."

Although the two major plant phytochromes A (phyA) and B (phyB) share similar absorption properties, they exhibit dramatic differences in their action spectra. Since both phytochromes antagonistically regulate seedling development under vegetative shade, it is essential for plants to clearly distinguish between phyA and phyB action. This discrimination is not comprehensible solely by the molecular properties of the phytochromes, but is evidently due to the dynamics of the phytochrome system. Using an integrated experimental and mathematical modelling approach we show that phytochrome dimerization is an essential element for phyB function. Our findings reveal that light-independent Pfr to Pr relaxation (dark reversion) and association/dissociation to nuclear bodies (NBs) severely depend on the conformational state of the phyB dimer.

Recent findings suggest that some zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) are involved in plant light-modulated morphogenesis. However, the interaction(s) between phyA, phyB and ZFP homologs potentially involved in photomorphogenesis, as well as their phenotypic and molecular effects in Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to R and FR light remain to be elucidated fully. Prior analyses with phytochrome chromophore deficient lines indicated that ZFP6 expression is misregulated compared to levels in Col-0 wild type (WT). Here, we used plants with phytochrome chromophore or apoprotein (specifically phyA and phyB) deficiencies, lines with mutations in ZFP6 and ZFP6 HOMOLOG (ZFPH) genes, and plants overexpressing ZFP6 to examine regulatory interactions between phytochromes, ZFP6, and ZFPH. Our results indicate that phytochromes are required for downregulation of ZFP6 and ZFPH and suggest a role for light-regulated control of ZFP levels in phytochrome-dependent photomorphogenesis. Conversely, PHYB is downregulated in zfp6 mutants under R light. Analyses of a zfp6zfph double mutant confirmed disruption in photomorphogenic phenotypes, including the regulation of hypocotyl elongation in seedlings grown under FR light. In addition, PIF3 and PIF4 levels are transcriptionally regulated by ZFP6 and ZFPH in a gibberellic acid-dependent manner. ZFP6 overexpression resulted in opposite phenotypic responses to those observed in the zfp6 and zfph mutants grown in FR and R light, as well as a reduction in the rosette size of mature ZFP6 OX plants relative to WT under white light.

Upon light stimulation, phyA and phyB interact with the phytochrome kinase substrate (PKS1) in the cytoplasm. In this study, we investigated the role of PKS1, along with phyA and phyB, in the positive phototropic responses to RL in roots. Using a high-resolution feedback system, we studied the phenotypic responses of roots of phyA, phyB, pks1, phyA pks1 and phyB pks1 null mutants as well as the PKS1-overexpressing line in response to RL. PKS1 emerged as an intermediary in the signalling pathways and appears to promote a negative curvature to RL in roots. In addition, phyA and phyB were both essential for a positive response to RL and act in a complementary fashion. However, either photoreceptor acting without the other results in negative curvature in response to red illumination so that the mode of action differs depending on whether phyA and phyB act independently or together.

However, our understanding of the phytochrome signaling network is incomplete, and little is known about the individual roles of phytochromes and how they function cooperatively to mediate light responses. Here, we used a bottom-up approach to study the phytochrome network. We added each of the five phytochromes to a phytochrome-less background to study their individual roles and then added the phytochromes by pairs to study their interactions. By analyzing the 16 resulting genotypes, we revealed unique roles for each phytochrome and identified novel phytochrome interactions that regulate germination and the onset of flowering. Furthermore, we found that ambient temperature has both phytochrome-dependent and -independent effects, suggesting that multiple pathways integrate temperature and light signaling. Surprisingly, none of the phytochromes alone conferred a photoperiodic response. Although phyE and phyB were the strongest repressors of flowering, both phyB and phyC were needed to confer a flowering response to photoperiod. Thus, a specific combination of phytochromes is required to detect changes in photoperiod, whereas single phytochromes are sufficient to respond to light quality, indicating how phytochromes signal different light cues."

HOS1 inhibits the transcriptional activation activity of PIF4 by forming protein complexes. Notably, phyB-mediated light signals induce HOS1 activity, thus promoting hypocotyl photomorphogenesis.

Later in the life cycle of the plant, PHYB and GAs have opposite effects on flowering. PHYB delays flowering, while GAs promote flowering, particularly under noninductive photoperiods. To learn how PHYB and GAs interact in the control of flowering, we have analyzed the effect of a phyB mutation on flowering time and on the expression of the floral meristem-identity gene LFY (LEAFY). We show that the early flowering caused by phyB correlated with an increase in LFY expression, which complements our previous finding that GAs are required for activation of LFY under noninductive photoperiods (M.A. Blázquez, R. Green, O. Nilsson, M.R. Sussman, D. Weigel [1998] Plant Cell 10: 791-800). Since phyB did not change the GA responsiveness of the LFY promoter and suppressed the lack of flowering of severe GA-deficient mutants under short days, we propose that PHYB modulates flowering time at least partially through a GA-independent pathway. Interestingly, the effects of PHYB on flowering do not seem to be mediated by transcriptional up-regulation of genes such as CO (CONSTANS) and FT (Flowering locus T), which are known to mediate the effects of the photoperiod-dependent floral-induction pathway."

The addition of NPA to hypocotyls grown in R- and FR-enriched light inhibited hypocotyl gravitropism to a greater extent in both abp1 mutants and in phyB-9 and phyA-211 than the wild-type hypocotyl, arguing for decreased phytochrome action in conjunction with auxin transport in abp1 mutants. Transcription of FR-enriched light-induced genes, including several genes regulated by auxin and shade, was reduced 3-5-fold in abp1-5 compared with Col and was very low in abp1/ABP1. In the phyB-9 mutant the expression of these reporter genes was 5-15-fold lower than in Col. In tir1-1 and the phyA-211 mutants shade-induced gene expression was greatly attenuated.

The photon fluence required for induction and photoreversible inhibition of germination was examined using the Okazaki large spectrograph. At the wavelengths of 400-710 nm, the ABO seeds required significantly less photon fluence than wild-type seeds for induction of germination, whereas the RBO seeds required similar fluence to wild-type seeds. A critical threshold wavelength for either induction or inhibition of germination of ABO seeds shifted towards the longer wavelengths relative to wild-type seeds. By assuming that PhyA and PhyB are similar in their photochemical parameters, amounts of Pfr at each wavelength were calculated. The photon fluence required for 50% germination was equivalent to the fluence generating a Pfr/Ptot ratio of 0.21-0.43 in wild-type seeds, and of 0.035-0.056 in ABO seeds.

But mutation of SPT in the background of phyb-1 rescues the phenotype of spt-2. The flowering time of double mutant of spt-2/phyb-1 is similar with the wild type. These results indicate that SPT promotes the transition from vegetative stage to floral stage and it regulates this transition in a PHYB-dependent manner. With qRT-PCR analysis, it is found that SPT regulates flowering time via FLC, SVP, FT and SOC1. Furthermore, SPT also controls photomorphogenesis. spt-2 displays shortened hypocotyls and increased chlorophylls contents compared with the wild type. These phenotypes are also rescued in the double mutant of spt-2/phyb-1. These results indicate that SPT is also involved in photomorphogenic development in Arabidopsis and SPT regulates photomorphogenesis in a PHYB-dependent manner. Collectively, SPT is not only a temperature responder but it is also an important light regulator during plant growth and development."

We now report the isolation of multiple phyC mutant alleles using reverse-genetics strategies. Molecular analysis shows that these mutants have undetectable levels of phyC protein, suggesting that they are null for the photoreceptor. phyC mutant seedlings were indistinguishable from wild-type seedlings under constant far-red light (FRc), and phyC deficiency had no effect in the phyA mutant background under FRc, suggesting that phyC does not participate in the control of seedling deetiolation under FRc. However, when grown under constant red light (Rc), phyC seedlings exhibited a partial loss of sensitivity, observable as longer hypocotyls and smaller cotyledons than those seen in the wild type. Although less severe, this phenotype resembles the effect of phyB mutations on photoresponsiveness, indicating that both photoreceptors function in regulating seedling deetiolation in response to Rc. On the other hand, phyB phyC double mutants did not show any apparent decrease in sensitivity to Rc compared with phyB seedlings, indicating that the phyC mutation in the phyB-deficient background does not have an additive effect. These results suggest that phyB is necessary for phyC function. This functional dependence correlates with constitutively lower levels of phyC observed in the phyB mutant compared with the wild type, a decrease that seems to be regulated post-transcriptionally. phyC mutants flowered early when grown in short-day photoperiods, indicating that phyC plays a role in the perception of daylength. phyB phyC double mutant plants flowered similarly to phyB plants, indicating that in the phyB background, phyC deficiency does not further accelerate flowering. Under long-day photoperiods, phyA phyC double mutant plants flowered later than phyA plants, suggesting that phyC is able to promote flowering in the absence of phyA. Together, these results suggest that phyC is involved in photomorphogenesis throughout the life cycle of the plant, with a photosensory specificity similar to that of phyB/D/E and with a complex pattern of differential crosstalk with phyA and phyB in the photoregulation of multiple developmental processes."

However, whether phyB-RVE1 coordinates with GA signaling in controlling seed dormancy and germination remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that RVE1 regulation of seed dormancy and germination requires a DELLA repressor, REPRESSOR OF GA-LIKE2 (RGL2), in Arabidopsis thaliana. RVE1 interacts with both RGL2 and its E3 ubiquitin ligase SLEEPY1 (SLY1) and promotes RGL2 stability by restraining the RGL2-SLY1 interaction. Furthermore, RVE1 and RGL2 synergistically regulate global transcriptome changes; RGL2 enhances the DNA-binding capacity and transcriptional activity of RVE1 in regulating downstream gene expression. Moreover, RGL2 expression is repressed by phyB. Our study reveals a novel regulatory mechanism in which the RVE1-RGL2 module coordinately controls seed dormancy and germination by integrating light perception, GA metabolism and GA signaling pathways."

The ubiquitous nature of the phototropic response in the plant kingdom implies that it provides some adaptive evolutionary advantage. Upon visual inspection it is tempting to surmise that phototropic curvatures result from a relatively simple growth response to a directional stimulus. However, detailed photophysiological, and more recently genetic and molecular, studies have demonstrated that phototropism is in fact regulated by complex interactions among several photosensory systems. At least two receptors, phototropin and a presently unidentified receptor, appear to mediate the primary photoreception of directional blue light cues in dark-grown plants. PhyB may also function as a primary receptor to detect lateral increases in far-red light in neighbor-avoidance responses of light-grown plants. Phytochromes (phyA and phyB at a minimum) also appear to function as secondary receptors to regulate adaptation processes that ultimately modulate the magnitude of curvature induced by primary photoperception. As a result of the interactions of these multiple photosensory systems plants are able to maximize the adaptive advantage of the phototropic response in ever changing light environments."

In particular, we demonstrate that phyB-101 Pfr exhibits rapid nonphotochemical (dark) reversion to Pr that results in a lower photoequilibrium level of the active Pfr form. We conclude that this occurs in vivo as well because phyB-101 mutants are shown to lack an end-of-day-far-red hypocotyl elongation response that requires a stable Pfr species. We propose that this Pfr instability may be the primary molecular mechanism underlying the phyB-101 mutant phenotype."

The phyB mutant elongates more than the wild type in response to the same exogenous concentrations of GA3 or GA4, showing that the mutation causes an increase in responsiveness to GAs. Among GAs that we were able to detect, we found no significant difference in endogenous levels between wild-type and phyB mutant seedlings. However, GA4 levels were below our limit of detectability, and the concentration of that active GA could have varied between wild-type and phyB mutant seedlings.

PP7L, PP7, and PP7-long constitute a subfamily of phosphoprotein phosphatases. PP7 is thought to transduce a blue-light signal perceived by crys and phy a that induces expression of SIGMA FACTOR5 (SIG5). We observed that, like PP7, PP7L was predominantly localized to the nucleus in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and the pp7l phenotype was similar to that of the sig6 mutant. However, SIG6 expression was unaltered in pp7l mutants. Instead, loss of PP7L compromised translation and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) maturation in chloroplasts, pointing to a distinct mechanism influencing chloroplast development. Promoters of genes deregulated in pp7l-1 were enriched in PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR (PIF)-binding motifs and the transcriptome of pp7l-1 resembled those of pif and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS1 (COP1) signalosome complex (csn) mutants.

The lack of PP7L increased susceptibility to salt and high-light stress, whereas PP7L overexpression conferred resistance to high-light stress. Strikingly, PP7L was specifically recruited to Brassicales for the regulation of chloroplast development. This study adds another player involved in chloroplast biogenesis."

The responsiveness to the inductive red pulses is primarily mediated by phyB which is rather stable in its far-red-absorbing form as demonstrated by a very slow loss of reversibility. Without preirradiation the red pulses had an impact on hypocotyl elongation only in PHYA mutants but not in the wild type. This indicates a suppression of phyB function by the presence of phyA. Preirradiation with either far-red or blue light resulted in an inhibition of hypocotyl elongation by red pulses in the wild type. Responsiveness amplification by far-red light is mediated by phyA and disappears slowly in the dark. The extent of responsiveness amplification by blue light was identical in the wild type and in the absence of phyA, or the cryptochromes cryl (hy4-2.23n) or cry2 (fha-1). Therefore, we conclude that stimulation of phyB by blue light preirradiation is either mediated by an additional still-unidentified blue-light-absorbing pigment or that phyA, cry1 and cry2 substitute for each other completely. Both blue and red preirradiation established responsiveness to red pulses in phyA-201/phyB-5 double mutants.

High red to far-red ratios increase the proportion of phytochrome B (phyB) in its active form and the phyB mutant exhibited a constitutively low stomata density. phyB increased the stomata index (the ratio between stomata and epidermal cells number) and the level of anphistomy (by increasing stomata density more intensively in the adaxial than in the abaxial face). phyB promoted the expression of FAMA and TOO MANY MOUTHS genes involved in the regulation of stomata development in young leaves. Increased stomata density resulted in increased transpiration per unit leaf area. However, phyB promoted photosynthesis rates only at high fluence rates of photosynthetically active radiation. In accordance to these observations, phyB reduced long-term water-use efficiency estimated by the analysis of isotopic discrimination against (13)CO(2).

Analysis of epistatic interactions between jazQ and phyB reveal that growth inhibition associated with enhanced anti-insect resistance is likely not caused by diversion of photoassimilates from growth to defense but rather by a conserved transcriptional network that is hardwired to attenuate growth upon activation of jasmonate signalling.

We have found that both phyA and phyB mutants have a deficiency in germination, the phyA mutant in far-red light and the phyB mutant in the dark. Furthermore, the germination defect caused by the phyA mutation in far- red light could be suppressed by a phyB mutation, suggesting that phytochrome B (PHYB) can have an inhibitory as well as a stimulatory effect on germination. In red light, the phyA phyB double mutant, but neither single mutant, had poorly developed cotyledons, as well as reduced red-light induction of CAB gene expression and potentiation of chlorophyll induction. The phyA mutant was deficient in sensing a flowering response inductive photoperiod, suggesting that PHYA participates in sensing daylength.

Genetic suppressor screens for mutations that uncouple growth-defense tradeoffs in the jazD mutant identified nine independent causal mutations in the red-light receptor phytochrome B (phyB). Unlike the ability of the phyB mutations to completely uncouple the mild growth-defense phenotypes in a jaz mutant (jazQ) defective in JAZ1, JAZ3, JAZ4, JAZ9, and JAZ10, phyB null alleles only weakly alleviated the growth and reproductive defects in the jazD mutant. phyB-independent growth restriction of the jazD mutant was tightly correlated with upregulation of the Trp biosynthetic pathway but not with changes in central carbon metabolism. Interestingly, jazD and jazD phyB plants were insensitive to a chemical inhibitor of Trp biosynthesis, which is a phenotype previously observed in plants expressing hyperactive MYC transcription factors that cannot bind JAZ repressors.

These phyB missense mutants fall into two general classes: Class I (eleven mutants) containing those defective in light signal perception, due to aberrant chromophore attachment or photoconversion, and Class II (four mutants) containing those normal in signal perception, but defective in the capacity to transduce this signal to PIF3. By generating a homology model for the three-dimensional structure of the Arabidopsis phyB chromophore-binding region, based on the crystal structure of Deinococcus radiodurans phytochrome, we predict that three of the four Class II mutated phyB residues are solvent exposed in a cleft between the presumptive PAS and GAF domains. This deduction suggests that these residues could be directly required for the physical interaction of phyB with PIF3. Because these three residues are also necessary for phyB-imposed inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in response to red light, they are functionally necessary for signal transfer from photoactivated phyB, not only to PIF3 and other related bHLH transcription factors tested here, but also to other downstream signaling components involved in regulating seedling deetiolation."

This gene may have evolved from gymnosperms and expanded in angiosperms with highly conserved expression patterns in seeds. WOX11 and its homolog WOX12 were highly expressed from 2 days after pollination, and mRNA abundance was highly increased in the seed dormancy induction and release stages. We further demonstrated that WOX11 plays a role in the regulation of seed dormancy downstream of PHYB-mediated red light signaling during the seed dormancy accumulation stage, which indicates that WOX11/12 are newly identified components of red light signaling transduction and have roles in seed dormancy regulation. Altogether, our results suggested that WOX11/12-mediated PHYB signaling regulates seed dormancy in Arabidopsis, providing insight into the developmental regulation and evolutionary adaptation of plants to light environment changes."

Here we show that PHYB plays an equally critical role in temperature sensing during the daytime. In daytime thermosensing, PHYB signals primarily through the temperature-responsive transcriptional regulator PIF4, which requires the transcriptional activator HEMERA (HMR). HMR does not regulate PIF4 transcription, instead, it interacts directly with PIF4, to activate the thermoresponsive growth-relevant genes and promote warm-temperature-dependent PIF4 accumulation. A missense allele hmr-22, which carries a loss-of-function D516N mutation in HMR's transcriptional activation domain, fails to induce the thermoresponsive genes and PIF4 accumulation. Both defects of hmr-22 could be rescued by expressing a HMR22 mutant protein fused with the transcriptional activation domain of VP16, suggesting a causal relationship between HMR-mediated activation of PIF4 target-genes and PIF4 accumulation. Together, this study reveals a daytime PHYB-mediated thermosensing mechanism, in which HMR acts as a necessary activator for PIF4-dependent induction of temperature-responsive genes and PIF4 accumulation."

We have characterized this typical photomorphogenetic response of rice using mutants deficient in phytochrome A (phyA) and phytochrome B (phyB) and with respect to age-dependency and action spectra. Seedlings were irradiated with a pulse of light 40 h or 80 h after germination (i.e. at an early or late developmental stage) and the final coleoptile length of these seedlings was determined. A saturating pulse of red light (R) had a stronger effect when it was given in the late stage than in the early stage. It was found that the photoinhibition is mediated by both the phyA and the phyB in the late stage but predominantly by phyB in the early stage. Consistent with many other reported responses, the photo-inhibition in the phyA mutant, which was observed in the early and late developmental stages and is thought to be mediated mainly by phyB, occurred in the low-fluence range (10(1)-10(3) micromol m(-2)) of R and was far-red-light (FR)-reversible; the photo-inhibition in the phyB mutant, which was observed in the late developmental stage and is thought to be mediated mainly by phyA, occurred in the very-low-fluence range (10(-2)-10(0) micromol m(-2)) and was FR-irreversible. The action spectra (350-800 nm at 50 nm intervals) obtained at the two developmental stages using phyA and phyB mutants indicated that both the phyB-mediated low-fluence response and the phyA-mediated very-low-fluence response have a major peak at 650 nm and a minor peak at 400 nm."

Light is one of the most important environmental factors involved in the relief of dormancy to promote seed germination. In Arabidopsis thaliana seeds, phytochrome photoreceptors tightly regulate gene expression at different levels. The contribution of alternative splicing (AS) regulation in the photocontrol of seed germination is still unknown. The aim of this work is to study gene expression modulated by light during germination of A. thaliana seeds, with focus on AS changes. Hence, we evaluated transcriptome-wide changes in stratified seeds irradiated with a pulse of red (Rp) or far-red (FRp) by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Our results show that the Rp changes the expression of ∼20% of the transcriptome and modifies the AS pattern of 226 genes associated with mRNA processing, RNA splicing, and mRNA metabolic processes. We further confirmed these effects for some of the affected AS events. Interestingly, the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses show that the Rp modulates the AS of splicing-related factors (At-SR30, At-RS31a, At-RS31, and At-U2AF65A), a light-signaling component (At-PIF6), and a dormancy-related gene (At-DRM1). Furthermore, while the phytochrome B (phyB) is responsible for the AS pattern changes of At-U2AF65A and At-PIF6, the regulation of the other AS events is independent of this photoreceptor. We conclude that (i) Rp triggers AS changes in some splicing factors, light-signaling components, and dormancy/germination regulators; (ii) phyB modulates only some of these AS events; and (iii) AS events are regulated by R and FR light, but this regulation is not directly associated with the intensity of germination response. These data will help in boosting research in the splicing field and our understanding about the role of this mechanism during the photocontrol of seed germination."

Thus far, several negative regulators of seed germination that act when PHYB is inactive have been reported. However, neither positive regulators of seed germination downstream of PHYB nor a direct mechanism for regulation of the hormone levels has been elucidated. Here, we show that the histone arginine demethylases, JMJ20 and JMJ22, act redundantly as positive regulators of seed germination. When PHYB is inactive, JMJ20/JMJ22 are directly repressed by the zinc-finger protein SOMNUS. However, upon PHYB activation, JMJ20/JMJ22 are derepressed, resulting in increased gibberellic acid levels through the removal of repressive histone arginine methylations at GA3ox1/GA3ox2, which in turn promotes seed germination."

The phytochrome photoreceptors are able to detect a reduction in the red:far red ratio in incident light, the result of selective absorption of red and blue wavelengths by proximal vegetation. A shade-responsive luciferase reporter line (PHYB::LUC) was used to carry out a high-throughput screen to identify novel SAS mutants. The dracula 1 (dra1) mutant, that showed no avoidance of shade for the PHYB::LUC response, was the result of a mutation in the PHYA gene. Like previously characterized phyA mutants, dra1 showed a long hypocotyl in far red light and an enhanced hypocotyl elongation response to shade. However, dra1 additionally showed a long hypocotyl in red light. Since phyB levels are relatively unaffected in dra1, this gain-of-function red light phenotype strongly suggests a disruption of phyB signalling. The dra1 mutation, G773E within the phyA PAS2 domain, occurs at a residue absolutely conserved among phyA sequences. The equivalent residue in phyB is absolutely conserved as a threonine. PAS domains are structurally conserved domains involved in molecular interaction. Structural modelling of the dra1 mutation within the phyA PAS2 domain shows some similarity with the structure of the phyB PAS2 domain, suggesting that the interference with phyB signalling may be the result of non-functional mimicry. Hence, it was hypothesized that this PAS2 residue forms a key distinction between the phyA and phyB phytochrome species."

In the wild type and the phyB mutant, PhyA photoirreversibly induced CAB expression upon irradiation with very-low-fluence light of 350 to 750 nm. In contrast, using the phyA mutant, PhyB photoreversibly induced CAB expression with low-fluence red light. The threshold fluences of red light for PhyA- and PhyB-specific induction were about 10 nmol m-2 and 10 mumol m-2, respectively. In addition, CAB expression was photoreversibly induced with low-fluence red light in the phyA/phyB double mutant, revealing that another phytochrome(s) (PhyX) regulated CAB expression in a manner similar to PhyB.

The fluence rate response of hypocotyl elongation was examined and showed a biphasic response. Whereas photomorphogenic responses were observed at low doses, higher fluences resulted in damage symptoms. In support of our theory that photomorphogenesis, but not damage, occurs at low doses of UV-B, photomorphogenic responses of UV-B sensitive mutants were indistinguishable from wild-type plants at the low dose. This allowed us to examine UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis in photoreceptor deficient plants and constitutive photomorphogenic mutants. The cry1 cryptochrome structural gene mutant, and phytochrome deficient hy1, phyA and phyB mutant seedlings resembled wild-type seedlings, while phyA/phyB double mutants were less sensitive to the photomorphogenic effects of UV-B. These results suggest that either phyA or phyB is required for UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis. The constitutive photomorphogenic mutants cop1 and det1 did not show significant inhibition of hypocotyl growth in response to UV-B, while det2 was strongly affected by UV-B irradiation. This suggests that COP1 and DET1 work downstream of the UV-B signaling pathway."

In this study, we identified rrc1 (reduced red-light responses in cry1cry2 background 1), an Arabidopsis mutant that is impaired in phyB-mediated light responses. A genetic analysis demonstrated that RRC1 affected light signaling in a phyB-dependent manner. RRC1 encodes an ortholog of the human potential splicing factor SR140. The RRC1 polypeptide contains a C-terminal arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain that is important for the regulation of alternative splicing. Although the complete loss of RRC1 caused pleiotropic developmental abnormalities, the deletion of the RS domain specifically reduced phyB signaling and caused aberrant alternative splicing of several SR protein genes. Moreover, semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the alternative splicing patterns of some of the SR protein genes were altered in a red-light-dependent manner, and that these responses were reduced in both phyB and rrc1 mutants. These findings suggest that the regulation of alternative splicing by the RS domain of RRC1 plays an important role in phyB signal transduction."

The results indicate that the seed germination is regulated by PhyA and PhyB but not by other phytochromes, and the effects of PhyA and PhyB are separable in this assay. We determined action spectra separately for PhyA- and PhyB-specific induction of seed germination at Okazaki large spectrograph. Action spectra for the PhyA response show that monochromatic 300-780 nm lights of very low fluence induced the germination, and this induction was not photoreversible in the range examined. Action spectra for the PhyB response show that germination was photoreversibly regulated by alternate irradiations with light of 0.01-1 mmol m-2 at wavelengths of 540-690 nm and 695-780 nm.

To investigate to what level a rice phyA can complement for Arabidopsis phyA or phyB function and to evaluate the role of the serine residues in the first 20 amino acids of the N-terminus of phyA, we examined VLFR, LFR, and HIR responses in phyB and phyAphyB mutant plants transformed with rice PHYA cDNA or a mutant rice PHYA cDNA in which the first 10 serine residues were mutated to alanines (phyA SA). Utilizing mutants without endogenous phyB allowed the evaluation of red-light-derived responses sensed by the rice phyA. In summary, the WT rice phyA could complement VLFR and LFR responses such as inhibition of hypocotyl elongation under pulses of FR or continuous R light, induction of flowering and leaf expansion, whereas the phyA SA was more specific for HIR responses (e.g. inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and anthocyanin accumulation under continuous far-red light). As the N-terminal serines can no longer be phosphorylated in the phyA SA mutant, this suggests a role for phosphorylation discriminating between the different phyA-dependent responses.

As a small molecular signal, carbon monoxide (CO) has been reported to regulate seed germination under environmental stress, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we first found that CO enhanced PHYB-dependent seed germination, and red light irradiation increased the transcriptional level of gene encoding Heme oxygenase 1(HY1) for CO production, this process required PHYB. Pharmacological and genetic analyses revealed that CO signals repressed the transcriptional level of SOM to alter downstream GA/ABA metabolism related genes expression, ultimately relieving the inhibitory effect of SOM on seed germination. Furthermore, CO signals possibly recruited histone deacetylase 6 (HDA6) to the promoter region of SOM to decrease its expression by diminishing histone H3 acetylation levels at this locus. Taken together, our results propose a novel mechanism for CO signals in promoting light-initiated seed germination via recruiting HDA6 to epigenetically regulate SOM expression."

However, it remains unknown whether phyB mediates the temperature signal that regulates leaf senescence. We found the light-activated form of phyB (Pfr) remains active at least four days after a transfer to darkness at 20°C but is inactivated more rapidly at 28°C. This faster inactivation of Pfr further increases PIF4 protein levels at the higher ambient temperature. In addition, PIF4 mRNA levels rise faster after the transfer to darkness at high ambient temperature via a mechanism that depends on ELF3 but not phyB. Increased PIF4 protein then binds to the ORE1 promoter and activates its expression together with ABA and ethylene signaling, accelerating leaf senescence at high ambient temperature.

Light-saturated photosynthesis and the response of net CO2 exchange to low and high internal CO2 concentrations suggest that the levels or activity of the components of the Calvin cycle and electron transport might be reduced in the quadruple mutant. Most of the under-expressed proteins in the phyA phyB cry1 cry2 quadruple mutant consistently showed a chloroplastic localization, whereas components of the Calvin cycle and light reaction centers were overrepresented. Additionally, Rubisco expression was reduced threefold in the phyA phyB cry1 cry2 quadruple mutant. Together, these results highlight the importance of the phytochrome and cryptochrome families in proper autotrophy establishment in plants. They also suggest that an overall limitation in the chlorophyll levels, expression of Rubisco, and enzymes of the Calvin Cycle and electron transport that affect ribulose-1,5-biphosphate (RuBP) regeneration reduced photosynthetic capacity in the phyA phyB cry1 cry2 quadruple mutant."

The HKRD is a dimerization domain for PHYB homo and heterodimerization. A D1040V mutation, which disrupts the dimerization of HKRD and the interaction between C-terminal module and PIF3, abrogates PHYB nuclear accumulation, photobody biogenesis, and PIF3 degradation. By contrast, disrupting the interaction between PIF3 and PHYB's N-terminal module has little effect on PIF3 degradation. Together, this study demonstrates that the dimeric form of the C-terminal module plays important signaling roles by targeting PHYB to subnuclear photobodies and interacting with PIF3 to trigger its degradation."

The phyB mutant of Arabidopsis is constitutively elongated and early flowering and displays attenuated responses to both reduced R/FR and end-of-day far-red light, conditions that induce strong shade-avoidance reactions in wild-type plants. This indicates that phyB plays an important role in the control of shade avoidance. In Arabidopsis phyB and phyD are the products of a recently duplicated gene and share approximately 80% identity. We investigated the role played by phyD in shade avoidance by analyzing the responses of phyD-deficient mutants. Compared with the monogenic phyB mutant, the phyB-phyD double mutant flowers early and has a smaller leaf area, phenotypes that are characteristic of shade avoidance. Furthermore, compared with the monogenic phyB mutant, the phyB-phyD double mutant shows a more attenuated response to a reduced R/FR for these responses. Compared with the phyA-phyB double mutant, the phyA-phyB-phyD triple mutant has elongated petioles and displays an enhanced elongation of internodes in response to end-of-day far-red light.

After simulated shade, the normally induced transcript levels of the SAS marker gene, ATHB2 are attenuated in ZTL-silenced plants. The auxin signaling pathway, known to be involved in SAS, was also significantly attenuated. Furthermore, NaZTL directly interacts with NaPHYBs, and regulates the transcript levels of PHYBs, PIF3a, PIF7 and PIF8 under shade.

PIF8 is one of the less-characterized Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) PIFs, whose putative orthologs are conserved in other plant species. PIF8 possesses a bHLH motif and an active phytochrome B motif but not an active phytochrome A motif. Consistent with this motif composition, PIF8 binds to G-box elements and interacts with the Pfr form of phyB but only very weakly, if at all, with that of phyA. PIF8 differs, however, from other PIFs in its protein accumulation pattern and functional roles in different light conditions. First, PIF8 inhibits phyA-induced seed germination, suppression of hypocotyl elongation, and randomization of hypocotyl growth orientation in far-red light, but it does not inhibit phyB-induced red light responses. Second, PIF8 protein accumulates more in far-red light than in darkness or red light. This is distinct from the pattern observed with PIF3, which accumulates more in darkness. This PIF8 accumulation pattern requires degradation of PIF8 by CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) in darkness, inhibition of COP1 by phyA in far-red light, and promotion of PIF8 degradation by phyB in red light. Together, our results indicate that PIF8 is a genuine PIF that represses phyA-mediated light responses."

Photoreceptor phytochrome B (PHYB) plays a predominant role in promoting seed germination in the initial phase after imbibition, partially by repressing phytochrome-interacting factor1 (PIF1). However, the mechanism underlying the PHYB-PIF1-mediated transcription regulation remains largely unclear. Here, we identified that histone deacetylase15 (HDA15) is a negative component of PHYB-dependent seed germination. Overexpression of HDA15 in Arabidopsis inhibits PHYB-dependent seed germination, whereas loss of function of HDA15 increases PHYB-dependent seed germination. Genetic evidence indicated that HDA15 acts downstream of PHYB and represses seed germination dependent on PIF1. Furthermore, HDA15 interacts with PIF1 both in vitro and in vivo. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis revealed that HDA15 and PIF1 co-regulate the transcription of the light-responsive genes involved in multiple hormonal signaling pathways and cellular processes in germinating seeds in the dark. In addition, PIF1 recruits HDA15 to the promoter regions of target genes and represses their expression by decreasing the histone H3 acetylation levels in the dark.

Using activation-tagging mutagenesis to identify novel light-signaling components, we have isolated a gain-of-function mutant, sob1-D (suppressor of phytochrome B-4 [phyB-4] dominant), which suppresses the long-hypocotyl phenotype of the phyB missense allele, phyB-4. The sob1-D mutant phenotype is caused by the overexpression of a Dof (DNA binding with one finger) transcription factor, OBF4 Binding Protein 3 (OBP3). A translational fusion between OBP3 and green fluorescent protein is nuclear localized in onion (Allium cepa) cells. Tissue-specific accumulation of an OBP3:OBP3-beta-glucuronidase translational fusion is regulated by light in Arabidopsis thaliana. Hypocotyls of transgenic lines with reduced OBP3 expression are less responsive to red light. This aberrant phenotype in red light requires functional phyB, suggesting that OBP3 is a positive regulator of phyB-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. Furthermore, these partial-loss-of-function lines have larger cotyledons. This light-dependent cotyledon phenotype is most dramatic in blue light and requires functional cryptochrome 1 (cry1), indicating that OBP3 is a negative regulator of cry1-mediated cotyledon expansion. These results suggest a model where OBP3 is a component in both phyB and cry1 signaling pathways, acting as a positive and negative regulator, respectively. An alternate, though not mutually exclusive, model places OBP3 as a general inhibitor of tissue expansion with phyB and cry1, differentially modulating OBP3's role in this response."

Immunoblot analysis showed that the phyE protein was undetectable in the phyE-1 mutant. In the phyA- and phyB-deficient background, phyE deficiency led to early flowering, elongation of internodes between adjacent rosette leaves, and reduced petiole elongation. This is a phenocopy of the response of phyA phyB seedlings to end-of-day far-red light treatments. Furthermore, a phyE deficiency attenuated the responses of phyA phyB seedlings to end-of-day far-red light treatments. Monogenic phyE mutants were indistinguishable from wild-type seedlings. However, phyB phyE double mutants flowered earlier and had longer petioles than did phyB mutants. The elongation and flowering responses conferred by phyE deficiency are typical of shade avoidance responses to the low red/far-red ratio.

While the roots are also known to respond to aboveground light through multiple routes of light signal transduction, root photomorphogenesis has been less highlighted until recently. A long-standing, critical question was how the underground roots are capable of sensing aerial light and how the root-sensed light signals trigger root photomorphogenesis. When the roots are directly exposed to light, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are rapidly produced to promote primary root elongation, which helps the roots to escape from the abnormal growth conditions. However, severe or long-term exposure of the roots to light causes ROS burst, which impose oxidative damages, leading to a reduction of root growth. We have recently found that phytochrome B (phyB) promotes abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis in the shoots and the shoot-derived ABA signals mediate ROS detoxification in the roots, lessening the detrimental effects of light on root growth. On the basis of these observations we propose that the phyB-mediated ABA signaling contributes to the shoot-root synchronization that is essential for optimal growth and performance in plants."

Wild type plants show more pronounced epinasty of the blade edges, while this is not the case in uvr8 mutant plants. The UVR8 effect thus mimics the effect of phytochrome (phy) B in red light. In addition, a meta-analysis of transcriptome data indicates that the UVR8 and phyB signaling pathways have over 70% of gene regulation in common. Moreover, in low levels of supplementary UV-B light, mutant analysis revealed that phyB signaling is necessary for epinasty of the blade edges.

While phyB deficiency decreased branching when the PPFD was low, the effect was suppressed by high PPFD and some branching aspects were actually promoted. Photosynthesis measurements showed that PPFD may influence branching in phyB-deficient plants at least partially through a specific signalling pathway rather than directly through energy effects on the shoot. The expression of various genes in unelongated buds of phyB-deficient and phyB-sufficient plants grown under high and low PPFD demonstrated potential roles for several hormones, including auxin, cytokinins and ABA, and also showed imperfect correlation between expression of the branching regulators BRC1 and BRC2 and bud fate.

Protein interaction assays and phosphorylation studies demonstrate that TOPP4 interacts directly with PIF5 and dephosphorylates it. Furthermore, TOPP4 inhibits the red light-induced ubiquitination and degradation of PIF5. These findings demonstrate that dephosphorylation of PIF5 by TOPP4 inhibits its ubiquitin-mediated degradation during photomorphogenesis.

We previously identified a class of SINA RING-type E3 ligases of Arabidopsis thaliana (SINATs), whose protein levels decrease in the dark and increase in red and blue light, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. In this study, we created transgenic lines carrying point mutations in SINAT genes and photoreceptors-NLS or -NES transgenic plants to investigate the regulatory mechanism of SINAT protein stability. We demonstrated that the degradation of SINATs is self-regulated, and SINATs interact with photoreceptors phytochrome B (phyB) and cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) in the cytoplasm, which leads to the degradation of SINATs in the dark. Furthermore, we observed that the red light-induced subcellular localization change of phyB and blue light-induced the dissociation of CRY1 from SINATs and was the major determinant for the light-promoted SINATs accumulation. Our findings provide a novel mechanism of how the stability and degradation of the E3 ligase SINATs are regulated by an association and dissociation mechanism through the red light-induced subcellular movement of phyB and the blue light-induced dissociation of CRY1 from SINATs."

We have previously hypothesized that phyB mediates a red-light inhibition of floral initiation and cry2 mediates a blue-light inhibition of the phyB function. Studies of the cry2/phyB double mutant provide direct evidence in support of this hypothesis. The function of cryptochromes in floral induction was further investigated using the cry2/cry1 double mutants. The cry2/cry1 double mutants showed delayed flowering in monochromatic blue light, whereas neither monogenic cry1 nor cry2 mutant exhibited late flowering in blue light. This result suggests that, in addition to the phyB-dependent function, cry2 also acts redundantly with cry1 to promote floral initiation in a phyB-independent manner. To understand how photoreceptors regulate the transition from vegetative growth to reproductive development, we examined the effect of sequential illumination by blue light and red light on the flowering time of plants. We found that there was a light-quality-sensitive phase of plant development, during which the quality of light exerts a profound influence on flowering time. After this developmental stage, which is between approximately day-1 to day-7 post germination, plants are committed to floral initiation and the quality of light has little effect on the flowering time. Mutations in either the PHYB gene or both the CRY1 and CRY2 genes resulted in the loss of the light-quality-sensitive phase manifested during floral development. The commitment time of floral transition, defined by a plant's sensitivity to light quality, coincides with the commitment time of inflorescence development revealed previously by a plant's sensitivity to light quantity - the photoperiod. Therefore, the developmental mechanism resulting in the commitment to flowering appears to be the direct target of the antagonistic actions of the photoreceptors."

It is challenging to test KPR as the available experimental systems fall short of only altering the binding half-lives and keeping other parameters of the interaction unchanged. We engineered an optogenetic system using the plant photoreceptor phytochrome B (PhyB) as a ligand to selectively control the dynamics of ligand binding to the TCR by light. This opto-ligand-TCR system was combined with the unique property of PhyB to continuously cycle between the binding and non-binding states under red light, with the light intensity determining the cycling rate and thus the binding duration. Mathematical modeling of our experimental datasets showed that indeed the ligand-TCR interaction half-life is the decisive factor for activating downstream TCR signaling, substantiating KPR."

All carry single amino acid substitutions in the transgene-encoded phyB that reduce activity by 40- to 1000-fold compared to the nonmutagenized parent.

Little is known about the effects of phyB on emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which play a major role as informational cues in indirect defense. We investigated the effects of phyB on direct and indirect defenses in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) using two complementary approaches to inactivate phyB: illumination with a low red to far-red ratio, simulating competition, and mutation of the two PHYB genes present in the tomato genome. Inactivation of phyB resulted in low levels of constitutive defenses and down-regulation of direct defenses induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Interestingly, phyB inactivation also had large effects on the blends of VOCs induced by MeJA. Moreover, in two-choice bioassays using MeJA-induced plants, the predatory mirid bug Macrolophus pygmaeus preferred VOCs from plants in which phyB was inactivated over VOCs from control plants. These results suggest that, in addition to repressing direct defense, phyB inactivation has consequences for VOC-mediated tritrophic interactions in canopies, presumably attracting predators to less defended plants, where they are likely to find more abundant prey."

In this study, we examined the role of phytochrome B (phyB) in the regulation of chlorophyll synthesis in rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.) through the characterization of a pale-green phenotype observed in the phyB mutant grown under continuous red light (Rc) irradiation. Our results show that the Rc-induced chlorophyll accumulation can be divided into two components--a phyB-dependent and a phyB-independent component, and that the pale-green phenotype is caused by the absence of the phyB-dependent component. To elucidate the role of the missing component we established an Rc-induced greening experiment, the results of which revealed that several genes encoding proteins on the chlorophyll branch were repressed in the phyB mutant. Notable among them were ChlH and GUN4 genes, which encode subunit H and an activating factor of magnesium chelatase (Mg-chelatase), respectively, that were largely repressed in the mutant. Moreover, the kinetic profiles of chlorophyll precursors suggested that Mg-chelatase activity simultaneously decreased with the reduction in the transcript levels of ChlH and GUN4. These results suggest that phyB mediates the regulation of chlorophyll synthesis through transcriptional regulation of these two genes, whose products exert their action at the branching point of the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway. Reduction of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) synthesis could be detected in the mutant, but the kinetic profiles of chlorophyll precursors indicated that it was an event posterior to the reduction of the Mg-chelatase activity. It means that the repression of 5-ALA synthesis should not be a triggering event for the appearance of the pale-green phenotype. Instead, the repression of 5-ALA synthesis might be important for the subsequent stabilization of the pale-green phenotype for preventing excessive accumulation of hazardous chlorophyll precursors, which is an inevitable consequence of the reduction of Mg-chelatase activity."

The phytochrome genes PHYA and PHYB showed distinct patterns of tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression in rice. The PHYA promoter-GUS was expressed in all leaf tissues in etiolated seedlings, while its expression was restricted to vascular bundles in expanded leaves of light-grown seedlings. These observations suggest that light represses the expression of the PHYA gene in all cells except vascular bundle cells in rice seedlings.

No interaction of the epitope-tagged proteins with type I phyA was detected. Gel filtration chromatography shows that all five of the Arabidopsis phytochromes are present in seedlings as dimers, and that the heteromeric type II phytochrome complexes migrate at molecular masses characteristic of heterodimers. Similar levels of heterodimer formation are observed in extracts of dark-grown seedlings, where the phytochromes are cytosolic, and light-grown seedlings, where they are predominantly nuclear. These findings indicate that Arabidopsis, which until now has been thought to contain five homodimeric forms of phytochrome, in fact contains multiple species of both homodimeric and heterodimeric phytochromes. The conservation of the phytochrome family throughout angiosperms suggests that heterodimeric red/far-red receptors may be present in many flowering plants."

Molecular mechanisms regulating shoot branching by light signals have not been investigated in detail. Analyses of light signaling mutants defective in branching provide insight into the molecular events associated with the phenomenon. It is well documented that phytochrome B (phyB) mutant plants display constitutive shade avoidance responses, including increased plant height and enhanced apical dominance. We investigated the phyB-1 mutant sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and analyzed the expression of the sorghum Teosinte Branched1 gene (SbTB1), which encodes a putative transcription factor that suppresses bud outgrowth, and the sorghum dormancy-associated gene (SbDRM1), a marker of bud dormancy. Buds are formed in the leaf axils of phyB-1; however, they enter into dormancy soon after their formation. The dormant state of phyB-1 buds is confirmed by the high level of expression of the SbDRM1 gene. The level of SbTB1 mRNA is higher in the buds of phyB-1 compared to wild type, suggesting that phyB mediates the growth of axillary shoots in response to light signals in part by regulating the mRNA abundance of SbTB1. These results are confirmed by growing wild-type seedlings with supplemental far-red light that induces shade avoidance responses. We hypothesize that active phyB (Pfr) suppresses the expression of the SbTB1 gene, thereby inducing bud outgrowth, whereas environmental conditions that inactivate phyB allow increased expression of SbTB1, thereby suppressing bud outgrowth."

Loss of function of SUVH5 leads to decreased PHYB-dependent seed germination. RNA-sequencing analysis displayed that SUVH5 regulates 24.6% of light-responsive transcriptome in imbibed seeds, which mainly related to hormonal signaling pathways and developmental processes. Furthermore, SUVH5 represses the transcription of ABA biosynthesis and signal transduction-related genes, as well as a family of DELAY OF GERMINATION (DOG) genes via dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2) in imbibed seeds.

Upon cadmium treatment, peak melatonin production was observed under combined red and blue (R + B) light, followed by red (R) and blue light (B).

Here we show a role for the red/far-red light photoreceptor PHYTOCHROME B (PHYB) in the regulation of cellulose synthesis in the growing Arabidopsis hypocotyl. In this organ, CSCs contains three distinct cellulose synthase (CESA) isoform classes: nonredundant CESA1 and CESA3 and a third class represented by partially redundant CESA2, CESA5, and CESA6. Interestingly, in the dark, depending on which CESA subunits occupy the third position, CSC velocity is more or less inhibited through an interaction with microtubules. Activation of PHYB overrules this inhibition. The analysis of cesa5 mutants shows a role for phosphorylation in the control of CSC velocity. These results, combined with the cesa5 mutant phenotype, suggest that cellulose synthesis is fine tuned through the regulated interaction of CSCs with microtubules and that PHYB signaling impinges on this process to maintain cell wall strength and growth in changing environments."

Because PHYB has been proposed as a candidate gene for several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting light response, we have investigated sequence and functional variation in Arabidopsis PHYB. We examined PHYB sequences in 33 A. thaliana individuals and in the close relative Arabidopsis lyrata. From 14 nonsynonymous polymorphisms, we chose 5 for further study based on previous QTL studies. In a larger collection of A. thaliana accessions, one of these five polymorphisms, I143L, was associated with variation in red light response. We used transgenic analysis to test this association and confirmed experimentally that natural PHYB polymorphisms cause differential plant responses to light. Furthermore, our results show that allelic variation of PHYB activity is due to amino acid rather than regulatory changes. Together with earlier studies linking variation in light sensitivity to photoreceptor genes, our work suggests that photoreceptors may be a common target of natural selection."

Silver ions, an ethylene receptor blocker, rescued the triple-response phenotype, and we show that PIF5-OX seedlings express enhanced levels of key ethylene biosynthesis enzymes and produce elevated ethylene levels. Exposure of PIF5-OX seedlings to prolonged continuous red light (Rc) promotes hypocotyl elongation relative to dark controls, the reciprocal of the Rc-imposed hypocotyl inhibition displayed by wild-type seedlings. In contrast with this PIF5-OX hyposensitivity to Rc, pif5 mutant seedlings are hypersensitive relative to wild-type seedlings. We show that this contrast is due to reciprocal changes in phyB protein levels in prolonged Rc. Compared with wild-type seedlings, PIF5-OX seedlings have reduced, whereas pif5 mutants have increased, phyB (and phyC) levels in Rc. The phyB degradation in the overexpressors depends on a functional phyB binding motif in PIF5 and involves the 26S proteasome pathway. Our data thus indicate that overexpressed PIF5 causes altered ethylene levels, which promote the triple response in darkness, whereas in the light, the interaction of photoactivated phyB with PIF5 causes degradation of the photoreceptor protein. The evidence suggests that endogenous PIF5 negatively regulates phyB-imposed hypocotyl inhibition in prolonged Rc by reducing photoreceptor abundance, and thereby photosensory capacity, rather than functioning as a signaling intermediate."

In addition to its effect on R:FRs, shade also reduces irradiance, but whether shade-induced drops in irradiance affect phyB activity has not been demonstrated. To address this issue, we investigated whether irradiance and R:FRs have similar effects on the nuclear distribution of phyB in petiole cells of light-grown plants. Under high-irradiance white light, phyB formed large nuclear bodies. Lowering irradiance without changing R:FRs or lowering R:FRs by adding far-red light led to the appearance of small nuclear bodies containing phyB. Large nuclear bodies remained but with some concomitant reduction in diameter. The appearance of small nuclear bodies was rapid, stable, and reversible upon the return to high irradiance and high R:FRs. High levels of red light but not of blue light were enough to restrain the formation of small phyB nuclear bodies. Irradiance was effective within the range found in natural canopies and even under relatively low R:FRs. The promotion of leaf hyponasty by lowering irradiance was impaired in phyB and pif mutants, as previously reported for the response to R:FRs. The expression of auxin-related genes showed a similar hierarchy of response to low R:FRs and low irradiance. We propose that phyB is able to perceive not only the low R:FRs, but also the low irradiance of shade."

The sob3-4 esc-8 double mutant had a long hypocotyl in multiple fluence rates of continuous white, far-red, red and blue light. sob3-4 esc-8 phyB-9 and sob3-4 esc-8 cry-103 triple mutants also had longer hypocotyls than photoreceptor single mutants. In contrast, the sob3-4 esc-8 phyA-211 triple mutant was the same length as phyA-211 single mutants. Taken together, these data indicate that SOB3 and ESC act redundantly to modulate hypocotyl growth inhibition in response to light."

Much remains to be learned about the mechanisms by which the phytochromes carry out their distinct and diverse functions. It is hoped that information concerning the localization of phytochromes, at the whole plant and subcellular levels, will aid in elucidating the mechanism of phytochrome function. This review, which summarizes information about phytochrome distribution, has an emphasis on recent reports in which the molecular species of phytochrome are differentiated. However, classical data are also included and reinterpreted using knowledge of the phytochrome family."

Plants actively monitor surrounding environments by sensing changes in light wavelength and intensity. Therefore, plants have evolved a series of photoreceptors to perceive a broad wavelength range of light. Phytochrome photoreceptors sense red and far-red light, which serves as a major photomorphogenic signal in shoot growth and morphogenesis. Notably, plants also express phytochromes in the roots, obscuring whether and how they perceive light in the soil. We have recently demonstrated that plants directly channel light to the roots through plant body to activate root phytochrome B (phyB). Stem light facilitates the nuclear import of phyB in the roots, and the photoactivated phyB triggers the accumulation of the photomorphogenic regulator ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 in modulating root growth and gravitropism. Optical experiments revealed that red to far-red light is efficiently transduced through plant body. Our findings provide physical and molecular evidence, supporting that photoreceptors expressed in the underground roots directly sense light. We propose that the roots are not a passive organ but a central organ that actively monitors changes in the aboveground environment by perceiving light information from the shoots."

PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR1 (PIF1) is a key transcription factor repressing phyB-mediated seed germination, while REVEILLE1 (RVE1) factor functions as a curial regulator in controlling both seed dormancy and germination. However, the relationship between the PIF1- and RVE1-modulated signaling pathways remains mostly unknown. Here, we find that PIF1 physically interacts with RVE1. Genetic analysis indicates that RVE1 inhibition on seed germination requires PIF1; reciprocally, the repressive effect of PIF1 is partially dependent on RVE1. Strikingly, PIF1 and RVE1 directly bind to the promoter and activate the expression of each other. Furthermore, PIF1 and RVE1 coordinately regulate the transcription of many downstream genes involved in abscisic acid and gibberellin pathways. Moreover, PIF1 enhances the DNA-binding ability and transcriptional repression activity of RVE1 in regulating GIBBERELLIN 3-OXIDASE2, and RVE1 promotes PIF1's DNA-binding ability in modulating ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE3 expression. Thus, this study demonstrates that PIF1 and RVE1 form a transcriptional feedback loop that coordinately inhibits seed germination, providing a mechanistic understanding of how phyB-mediated light signal is transduced to the seeds."

Tiller angle of cereal crops is a key agronomic trait that contributes to grain production. An understanding of how tiller angle is controlled is helpful for achieving ideal plant architecture to improve grain yield. Phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs) are known to regulate seed germination, seedling skotomorphogenesis, shade avoidance, and flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we report that OsPIL15 is, indeed, a rice PIF that negatively regulates tiller angle. Dominant-negative OsPIL15 plants displayed a larger tiller angle, which was associated with reduced shoot gravitropism. Phytochrome B (phyB) is the main photoreceptor perceiving the low red:far-red ratio of shade light. Compared with wild-type rice plants, loss-of-function phyB plants and OsPIL15-overexpressing plants showed smaller tiller angles and enhanced shoot gravitropism. In addition, more OsPIL15 protein accumulated in phyB plants than in wild-type plants. Light regulates the level of the OsPIL15 protein negatively, depending on phyB partially. We propose that OsPIL15 integrates light and gravity signals to regulate tiller angle in rice."

PCH1 peaks at dusk, binds phytochrome B (phyB) in a red light-dependent manner, and co-localizes with phyB into photobodies. PCH1 is necessary and sufficient to promote the biogenesis of large photobodies to maintain an active phyB pool after light exposure, potentiating red-light signaling and prolonging memory of prior illumination. Manipulating PCH1 alters PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 levels and regulates light-responsive gene expression.

We conclude that subfunctionalization at the protein-protein interaction level has altered the role of phyB2 relative to that of phyB1 in maize. Since the phyB2 mutant shows photomorphogenic defects, we conclude that maize phyB2 is an active photoreceptor, without the binding of PIF3 seen in other phyB family proteins."

The response to red pulses, enabled by the pre-irradiation of white light, was completely reversible by far-red light. Loss of reversibility occurred with an apparent half-life of 2 h, similar to the half-life of 3 h observed for the effect mediated by phyB.

We show that abc1k1 mutants display significantly short hypocotyls specifically under continuous red light and this effect is more apparent under higher red light fluence rates. The expression of PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs), transcription factors in red light signaling, is repressed in abc1k1 mutants under continuous red light. The expression pattern of ABC1K1 is independent of light conditions. Furthermore, genetic analysis indicates that abc1k1 almost completely suppresses the long hypocotyl phenotype of phyB and hy5. However, the mutation of ABC1K3, one homolog of ABC1K1, reverses the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in phyB and hy5 by abc1k1.

Closed expressions of the phyB and PIF3 concentrations after light exposure are derived, which capture the relevant timescales in the response of genes regulated by PIF3. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the promoters of the nuclear genes encoding sigma factors (SIGs) and polymerase-associated proteins (PAPs) required for expression of plastid encoded genes, contain the cis-elements for binding of PIF3. The model suggests a direct link between light inputs via PhyB-PIF3 to the plastid transcription machinery and control over the expression of photosynthesis components both in the nucleus and in the plastids.

As a result, light rapidly and efficiently represses ethylene actions. Specifically, phyB directly interacts with EIN3 in a light-dependent manner and also physically associates with F box protein EBFs. The light-activated association of phyB, EIN3, and EBF1/EBF2 proteins stimulates robust EIN3 degradation by SCFEBF1/EBF2 E3 ligases.

It is not clear whether reduced stomatal opening in a phytochrome B (phyB) mutant line, is due to phytochrome acting as a direct photosensor or an indirect growth effect. The exact tissue localization of the phytochrome photoreceptor important for stomatal opening is also not known. We studied differences in stomatal opening in an Arabidopsis phyB mutant, and lines showing mesophyll cell-specific or guard cell-specific inactivation of phytochromes. Stomatal conductance (gs) of intact leaves was measured under red, blue, and blue + far-red light. Lines exhibiting guard cell-specific inactivation of phytochrome did not show a change in gs under blue or red light compared to Col-0. phyB consistently exhibited a reduction in gs under both blue and red light. Addition of far-red light did not have a significant impact on the blue- or red-light-mediated stomatal response. Treatment of leaves with DCMU (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea), a photosynthetic electron transport (PET) inhibitor, eliminated the response to red light in all lines, indicating that stomatal opening under red light is controlled by PET, and not directly by phytochrome. Similar to previous studies, leaves of the phyB mutant line had fewer stomata. Overall, phytochrome does not appear have a predominant direct sensory role in stomatal opening under red or blue light.

Plants overexpressing HSFA9 increased accumulation of carotenoids, chlorophyllide, and chlorophyll, and displayed earlier unfolding of the cotyledons. HSFA9 enhanced phytochrome-dependent light responses, as shown by an intensified hypocotyl length reduction after treatments with continuous far-red or red light. This observation indicated the involvement of at least two phytochromes: PHYA and PHYB. Reduced hypocotyl length under darkness did not depend on phytochrome photo-activation; this was inferred from the lack of effect observed using far-red light pulses applied before the dark treatment. HSFA9 increased the expression of genes that activate photomorphogenesis, including PHYA, PHYB, and HY5. HSFA9 might directly upregulate PHYA and indirectly affect PHYB transcription, as suggested by transient expression assays. Converse effects on gene expression, greening, and cotyledon unfolding were observed using a dominant-negative form of HSFA9, which was overexpressed under a seed-specific promoter.

However, whether they act in the same tuberization pathway is unknown. Here we show the effect of a microRNA, miR172, on this developmental event. miR172 levels are higher under tuber-inducing short days than under non-inductive long days and are upregulated in stolons at the onset of tuberization. Overexpression of this microRNA in potato promotes flowering, accelerates tuberization under moderately inductive photoperiods and triggers tuber formation under long days. In plants with a reduced abundance of PHYB, which tuberize under long days, both BEL5 mRNA and miR172 levels are reduced in leaves and increased in stolons. This, together with the presence of miR172 in vascular bundles and the graft transmissibility of its effect on tuberization, indicates that either miR172 might be mobile or it regulates long-distance signals to induce tuberization. Consistent with this, plants overexpressing miR172 show increased levels of BEL5 mRNA, which has been reported to be transmissible through grafts. Furthermore, we identify an APETALA2-like mRNA containing a miR172 binding site, which is downregulated in plants overexpressing miR172 and plants in which PHYB is silenced.

Moreover, these synergistic responses do not require phyA or phyB. Phytochrome is a positive regulator of the cry1 inductive pathway, mediating distinct potentiation and coaction effects. A red light pretreatment enhances subsequent cry1-mediated CHS induction. This potentiation is unaltered in phyA and phyB mutants but much reduced in a phyA phyB double mutant, indicating that it requires principally phyA or phyB. In contrast, the cry1-mediated induction of CHS, without pretreatment, is much reduced in phyB but not phyA mutants, indicating coaction between cry1 and phyB. Further experiments with phy-deficient mutants demonstrate that phyB is a negative regulator of the UV-B inductive pathway. We further show that phyB acts upstream of the points of interaction of the UV-A and blue synergism pathways with the UV-B pathway. We propose that phyB functions to balance flux through the cry1 and UV-B signalling pathways."

We engineered a truncated variant of PIF6 comprising only 22 amino acids that can be genetically fused to the POI as an affinity tag. Thereby the POI can be purified with PhyB-functionalized resin material using 660 nm light for binding and washing, and 740 nm light for elution.

Although previous data have shown that the NH2-terminal halves of phyA and phyB each separately lack normal activity, fusion of the NH2-terminal half of phyA to the COOH-terminal half of phyB (phyAB) and the reciprocal fusion (phyBA) resulted in biologically active phytochromes. The behavior of these two chimeras in red and far-red light indicates: (i) that the NH2-terminal halves of phyA and phyB determine their respective photosensory specificities; (ii) that the COOH-terminal halves of the two photoreceptors are necessary for regulatory activity but are reciprocally inter-changeable and thus carry functionally equivalent determinants; and (iii) that the NH2-terminal halves of phyA and phyB carry determinants that direct the differential light lability of the two molecules. The present findings suggest that the contrasting photosensory information gathered by phyA and phyB through their NH2-terminal halves may be transduced to downstream signaling components through a common biochemical mechanism involving the regulatory activity of the COOH-terminal domains of the photoreceptors."

However, they are often exposed to ambient light that penetrates through cracks in the soil layers which can occur due to wind, heavy rain or temperature extremes. In response to light exposure, roots produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) which promote root growth. It is known that ROS-induced growth promotion facilitates rapid escape of the roots from non-natural light. Meanwhile, long-term exposure of the roots to light elicits a ROS burst, which causes oxidative damage to cellular components, necessitating that cellular levels of ROS should be tightly regulated in the roots. Here we demonstrate that the red/far-red light photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB) stimulates the biosynthesis of abscisic acid (ABA) in the shoots, and notably the shoot-derived ABA signals induce a peroxidase-mediated ROS detoxification reaction in the roots. Accordingly, while ROS accumulate in the roots of the phyb mutant that exhibits reduced primary root growth in the light, such an accumulation of ROS did not occur in the dark-grown phyb roots that exhibited normal growth. These observations indicate that mobile shoot-to-root ABA signaling links shoot phyB-mediated light perception with root ROS homeostasis to help roots adapt to unfavorable light exposure. We propose that ABA-mediated shoot-to-root phyB signaling contributes to the synchronization of shoot and root growth for optimal propagation and performance in plants."

Using a seed coat bedding assay where the growth of dissected embryos is monitored under the influence of dissected endosperm, allowing combinatorial use of mutant embryos and endosperm, we show that canopy light specifically inactivates phyB activity in the endosperm to override phyA-dependent signaling in the embryo. This interference involves abscisic acid (ABA) release from the endosperm and distinct spatial activities of phytochrome signaling components. Under the canopy, endospermic ABA opposes phyA signaling through the transcription factor (TF) ABI5, which shares with the TF PIF1 several target genes that negatively regulate germination in the embryo. ABI5 enhances the expression of phytochrome signaling genes PIF1, SOMNUS, GAI, and RGA, but also of ABA and gibberellic acid (GA) metabolic genes. Over time, weaker ABA-dependent responses eventually enable phyA-dependent germination, a distinct type of germination driven solely by embryonic growth."

A low R:FR indicative of competition induces the shade avoidance syndrome and suppresses branching by incompletely understood mechanisms. Phytochrome interacting factors (PIFs) are transcription factors targeted by phytochromes to evoke photomorphogenic responses. PIF4 and PIF5 promote shade avoidance responses and become inactivated by direct interaction with active phyB in the nucleus. Here, genetic and physiological assays show that PIF4 and PIF5 contribute to the suppression of branching resulting from phyB loss of function and a low R:FR, although roles for other PIFs or pathways may exist. The suppression of branching is associated with PIF4/PIF5 promotion of the expression of the branching inhibitor BRANCHED 1 and abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation in axillary buds and is dependent on the function of the key ABA biosynthetic enzyme Nine-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 3. However, PIF4/PIF5 function is not confined to a single hormonal pathway, as they also promote stem indole-3-acetic acid accumulation and stimulate systemic auxin signalling, which contribute to the suppression of bud growth when phyB is inactive."

Two red/far-red (R/FR) light photoreceptors, PHYB and PHYA, were reported to be key negative regulators of the SARs. PHYB represses the SARs under normal light conditions; however, the role of PHYA in the SARs remains elusive. We set up two shade conditions: Shade and strong Shade (s-Shade) with different R/FR ratios (0.7 and 0.1), which allowed us to observe phenotypes dominated by PHYB- and PHYA-mediated pathway, respectively. By comparing the hypocotyl growth under these two conditions with time, we found PHYA was predominantly activated in the s-Shade after prolonged shade treatment. We further showed that under s-Shade, PHYA inhibits hypocotyl elongation partially through repressing the brassinosteroid (BR) pathway. COP1 and PIF4,5 act downstream of PHYA. After prolonged shade treatment, the nuclear localization of COP1 was reduced, while the PIF4 protein level was much lower in the s-Shade than that in Shade. Both changes occurred in a PHYA-dependent manner. We propose that under deep canopy, the R/FR ratio is extremely low, which promotes the nuclear accumulation of PHYA. Activated PHYA reduces COP1 nuclear speckle, which may lead to changes of downstream targets, such as PIF4,5 and HY5. Together, these proteins regulate the BR pathway through modulating BES1/BZR1 and the expression of BR biosynthesis and BR target genes."

Here, we report that phytochrome B (phyB) mutants exhibit improved cold tolerance compared with wild type (WT) rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare). The phyB mutants had a lower electrolyte leakage index and malondialdehyde concentration than the WT, suggesting that they had greater cell membrane integrity and less lipid peroxidation. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the expression levels of dehydration-responsive element binding protein 1 (OsDREB1) family genes, which functions in the cold stress response in rice, were increased in the phyB mutant under normal and cold stress conditions. PIFs are central players in phytochrome-mediated light signaling networks. To explore the relationship between rice PIFs and OsDREB1 gene expression, we produced overexpression lines of rice PIF genes. OsDREB1 family genes were up-regulated in OsPIL16-overexpression lines, which had improved cold tolerance relative to the WT. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR assay revealed that OsPIL16 can bind to the N-box region of OsDREB1B promoter. Expression pattern analyses revealed that OsPIL16 transcripts were induced by cold stress and was significantly higher in the phyB mutant than in the WT. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid assay showed that OsPIL16 can bind to rice PHYB. Based on these results, we propose that phyB deficiency positively regulates OsDREB1 expression through OsPIL16 to enhance cell membrane integrity and to reduce the malondialdehyde concentration, resulting in the improved cold tolerance of the phyB mutants."

RRC1 has a C-terminal arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain that is generally important for the regulation of alternative splicing. Whereas rrc1 hypomorphic mutant alleles produce truncated RRC1 proteins that lack the C-terminal region, including the RS domain, and exhibit splicing defects and reduced phyB signaling, the rrc1-4 null allele additionally displays pleiotropic developmental abnormalities with more severe splicing defects. Here, we show that transgenic Arabidopsis plants that express truncated RRC1 lacking the RS domain in the rrc1-4 null allele background exhibited the same phenotype as the hypomorphic alleles. Hence, we conclude that deletion of the RS domain of RRC1 reduces phyB signaling, probably due to aberrant regulation of alternative splicing of target genes."

A genetic screen identified polyamine uptake transporter 2 (put2) mutants that overaccumulate polyamines, a class of antioxidant polycations implicated in numerous cellular functions, which we found promote phyA-mediated germination. In WT seeds, our data suggest that canopy light represses polyamines accumulation through PIF1 while red light promotes polyamines accumulation. We show that canopy light also downregulates PIF1 levels, through phyA; however, PIF1 reaccumulates rapidly, which limits phyA-mediated germination.

Plants synthesize a small family of Phy isoforms (PhyA to PhyE) that collectively regulate photomorphogenesis and temperature perception through redundant and unique actions. While the selective roles of these isoforms have been partially attributed to their differing abundances, expression patterns, affinities for downstream partners, and turnover rates, we show here from analysis of recombinant Arabidopsis chromoproteins that the Phy isoforms also display distinct biophysical properties. Included are a hypsochromic shift in the Pr absorption for PhyC and varying rates of Pfr to Pr thermal reversion, part of which can be attributed to the core photosensory module in each. Most strikingly, PhyB combines strong temperature dependence of thermal reversion with an order-of-magnitude faster rate to likely serve as the main physiological thermosensor, whereby thermal reversion competes with photoconversion. In addition, comparisons of Pfr occupancies for PhyA and PhyB under a range of red- and white-light fluence rates imply that low-light environments are effectively sensed by PhyA, while high-light environments, such as full sun, are effectively sensed by PhyB. Parallel analyses of the Phy isoforms from potato and maize showed that the unique features within the Arabidopsis family are conserved, thus indicating that the distinct biophysical properties among plant Phy isoforms emerged early in Phy evolution, likely to enable full interrogation of their light and temperature environments."

The phyB apoprotein present in the lv-1 mutant was undetectable in all three new lv mutants. The identification of allelic mutants with and without phyB apoprotein suggests that Lv may be a structural gene for a B-type phytochrome. Furthermore, it indicates that the lv-1 mutation results specifically in the loss of normal biological activity of this phytochrome. Red-light-pulse and fluence-rate-response experiments suggest that lv plants are deficient in the low-fluence response (LFR) but retain a normal very-low-fluence-rate-dependent response for leaflet expansion and inhibition of stem elongation. Comparison of lv alleles of differing severity indicates that the LFR for stem elongation can be mediated by a lower level of phyB than the LFR for leaflet expansion. The retention of a strong response to continuous low-fluence-rate R in all four lv mutants suggests that there may be an additional phytochrome controlling responses to R in pea. The kinetics of phytochrome destruction and reaccumulation in the lv mutant indicate that phyB may be involved in the light regulation of phyA levels."

Expression of the chromophore-bearing N-terminal domain of phyB alone resulted in a fully photoactive, monomeric molecule lacking normal regulatory activity. Expression of the C-terminal domain alone resulted in a photoinactive, dimeric molecule, also lacking normal activity. Thus, both domains are necessary, but neither is sufficient for phyB activity. Deletion of a small region on each major domain (residues 6 to 57 and 652 to 712, respectively) was shown to compromise phyB activity differentially without interfering with spectral activity or dimerization. Deletion of residues 6 to 57 caused a large increase in the fluence rate of continuous red light (Rc) required for maximal seedling responsiveness, indicating a marked decrease in efficiency of light signal perception or processing per mole of mutant phyB. In contrast, deletion of residues 652 to 712 resulted in a photoreceptor that retained saturation of seedling responsiveness to Rc at low fluence rates but at a response level much below the maximal response elicited by the parent molecule. This deletion apparently reduces the maximal biological activity per mole of phyB without a major decrease in efficiency of signal perception, thus suggesting disruption of a process downstream of signal perception. In addition, certain phyB constructs caused dominant negative interference with endogenous phyA activity in continuous far-red light, suggesting that the two photoreceptors may share reaction partners."

Evidence from phyB in Arabidopsis together with published evidence from CRY2 in tomato also supports the participation of both photoreceptor families in the global modulation of the plastome genes. To begin addressing how these light-sensors orchestrate changes in an organellar genome, we evaluated their effect over genes with potential functions in plastid gene-expression regulation based on their TAIR annotation. Results indicate that both crys and phys modulate 'plastome-regulatory genes' with enrichment in the contribution of crys to all processes and of phys to post-transcription and transcription.

Hypocotyl elongation was effectively inhibited when Arabidopsis and lettuce seedlings were irradiated with red R-CPL than with red L-CPL.

White R-CPL induced greater biomass production by adult Arabidopsis plants, as determined by their fresh shoot weight, than white L-CPL. To determine the molecular basis of these CPL effects, CD spectra and the effect of CPL on the photoreaction of a sensory module of Arabidopsis phyB were measured. The red light-absorbing form of phyB showed a negative CD in the red light-absorbing region, consistent with the results of germination, inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and biomass production. L-CPL and R-CPL, however, did not differ in their ability to induce the interconversion of the red light-absorbing and far-red light-absorbing forms of phyB.

The BBX transcription factors which responded to BL were also identified. The result showed that the FaBBX29, one of strawberry's BBX family genes, may play an important role in flowering regulation.

We have previously reported that the greening of Arabidopsis thaliana roots is regulated synergistically by phytochromes and cryptochromes. In the present study, we investigated the functions of the N- and C-terminal domains of phytochrome B (phyB) in the interactions between phyB and cryptochrome signaling cascades. Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing the phyB N-terminal domain fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), beta-glucuronidase (GUS) and the nuclear localization signal (NLS) showed intense root greening under blue light, indicating that the C-terminal domain was dispensable for the synergistic interaction in the induction of root greening. However, root greening under red light was substantially reduced in the absence of the C-terminal domain. This effect was opposite to the previous observation that removal of the C-terminal domain enhanced the signaling activity of phyB in the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. In addition, we found that overexpression of the isolated C-terminal domain of phyB enhanced the blue light response not only for root greening but also for the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. Analysis of this activity on various photoreceptor mutant backgrounds demonstrated that the isolated C-terminal domain enhanced cryptochrome signaling. In summary, these results demonstrate that different domains of phyB can play various roles which are dependent on light conditions as well as on the specific physiological response."

Phototransduction mediated by this light sensor has been shown to include light-dependent nuclear import and interaction of phyB with transcription factor-like proteins in the nucleus. Here we report that nuclear import of phyB and physiological responses regulated by this photoreceptor exhibit very similar wavelength- and fluence rate-dependence. Nuclear import of phyB is insensitive to single red, blue and far-red light pulses. It is induced by continuous red light and to a lesser extent by continuous blue light, whereas far-red light is completely ineffective.

Here, we show that inactivation of the gene PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3-LIKE 5 (PIL5) results in down-regulation of DAG1. Inactivation of PIL5 in the dag1 mutant background further increased the germination potential of dag1 mutant seeds, supporting the suggestion that DAG1 is under the positive control of PIL5. Germination of dag1phyB seeds showed a reduced requirement of gibberellins as compared with phyB mutant seeds, both in the presence and in the absence of GA biosynthesis. Furthermore, the GA biosynthetic gene AtGA3ox1 is upregulated in dag1 seeds as compared with the WT, and DAG1 actually binds to the AtGA3ox1 promoter, as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Expression analysis at different time points confirms that AtGA3ox1 is directly regulated by DAG1, while suggesting that DAG1 is not a direct regulatory target of PIL5. Our data indicate that in the phyB pathway leading to seed germination, DAG1 negatively regulates GA biosynthesis and suggest that DAG1 acts downstream of PIL5. In addition, the analysis of hypocotyls of dag1 and phyB mutant plantlets, of plantlets overexpressing phyB in the dag1 mutant, as well as of dag1phyB double mutant suggests that DAG1 may act as a negative regulatory element downstream of phyB also in hypocotyl elongation."

We explored the redundancy and diversity functions of the phytochrome family in the control of seed responsiveness to light and gibberellins (GA) by using a set of phytochrome mutants of Arabidopsis. Our data show that, in addition to the well-known role of phyB in the promotion of germination in response to high red to far-red ratios (R/FR), phyE and phyD stimulate germination at very low R/FR ratios, probably by promoting the action of phyA. Further, we show that phyC regulates negatively the seed responsiveness to light, unravelling unexpected functions for phyC in seed germination. Finally, we find that seed responsiveness to GA is mainly controlled by phyB, with phyC, phyD and phyE having relevant roles when acting in a phyB-deficient background.

Here, we identify a positive regulator of phyB-dependent seed germination, long hypocotyl in far-red1 (HFR1). HFR1 blocks PIF1 transcriptional activity by forming a heterodimer with PIF1 that prevents PIF1 from binding to DNA. Our whole-genomic analysis shows that HFR1 and PIF1 oppositely mediate the light-regulated transcriptome in imbibed seeds. Through the HFR1-PIF1 module, light regulates expression of numerous genes involved in cell wall loosening, cell division, and hormone pathways to initiate seed germination. The functionally antagonistic HFR1-PIF1 pair constructs a fail-safe mechanism for fine-tuning seed germination during low-level illumination, ensuring a rapid response to favorable environmental changes. This study identifies the HFR1-PIF1 pair as a central module directing the whole genomic transcriptional network to rapidly initiate light-induced seed germination."

During shade avoidance, stems elongate at the expense of leaf expansion, and flowering is accelerated. Of the five phytochromes-a family of red/far-red light photoreceptors-in Arabidopsis, phytochrome B (phyB) has the most significant role in shade-avoidance responses, but the mechanisms by which phyB regulates flowering in response to altered ratios of red to far-red light are largely unknown. Here we identify PFT1 (PHYTOCHROME AND FLOWERING TIME 1), a nuclear protein that acts in a phyB pathway and induces flowering in response to suboptimal light conditions.

Whereas phytochromes in the Pr form localize in the cytoplasm, phytochromes in the Pfr form accumulate in the nucleus, where they interact with transcription factors to regulate gene expression. The molecular details of the regulation of phytochrome translocation by light are poorly understood. Using Arabidopsis phyB as a model, we demonstrate that the C-terminal PAS-related domain (PRD) is both necessary and sufficient for phyB nuclear import and that the entire C terminus is required for nuclear-body (NB) localization. We also show that phyB's N-terminal bilin lyase domain (BLD) and PHY domain interact directly with the PRD in a light-dependent manner. In vivo localization studies indicate that BLD-PHY is sufficient to regulate phyB's nuclear accumulation.

Here, we describe the influence of phyA on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis seeds when germination is induced by a far-red (FR) pulse. The expression of 11% of the genome was significantly regulated by phyA. Most of the genes were up-regulated and the changes noted late (i.e. 5 h after a FR pulse), whereas changes in down-regulated genes were more abundant earlier (i.e. 0.5 h after a FR pulse). Auxin- and GA-associated elements were overrepresented in the genes that were modified by phyA. A significant number of genes whose expression was affected by phyA had not been previously reported to be dependent on PIL5. Among them, homozygotic mutant seeds of MYB66, a SAUR-like protein, PIN7, and GASA4 showed an impaired promotion of germination by phyA. Natural variation at the transcriptional level was found in early signaling and GA metabolic genes, but not in ABA metabolic and expansin genes between Columbia and Landsberg erecta accessions.

These fluence-response relationships demonstrate the existence of two response in enhancement, a response in the very-low-to-low-fluence range, and a response in the high-fluence range. Only the response in the high-fluence range is present in the phyA null mutant. In contrast, the phyB-deficient mutant is indistinguishable from the wild-type parent in red-light responsiveness. These data indiacate that phyA is necessary for the very-low-to-low but not the high-influence response, and that phyB is not necessary for either response range. Based on these results, the high-fluence response, if controlled by a single phytochrome, must be controlled by aphytochorme other than phyA of phyB. Overexpression of phyA has a negative effect and overexpression of phyB has an enhancing effect in the high-fluence range. These results suggest that overexpression of either phytochrome perturbs the function of the endogenous photoreceptor system in an unpredictable fashion."

Here, we present the crystal structure of the photosensing module (PSM) from a seed plant Phy in the Pr state using the PhyB isoform from Arabidopsis thaliana.

However, its Per/Arnt/Sim (PAS) domain, knot region, and helical spine show distinct structural differences potentially important to signaling. Included is an elongated helical spine, an extended β-sheet connecting the GAF domain and hairpin stem, and unique interactions between the region upstream of the PAS domain knot and the bilin A and B pyrrole rings. Comparisons of this structure with those from bacterial Phys combined with mutagenic studies support a toggle model for photoconversion that engages multiple features within the PSM to stabilize the Pr and Pfr end states after rotation of the D pyrrole ring. Taken together, this Arabidopsis PhyB structure should enable molecular insights into plant Phy signaling and provide an essential scaffold to redesign their activities for agricultural benefit and as optogenetic reagents."

Instead, this analysis indicates that following the divergence of the Solanaceae and Brassicaceae from one another, a PHYB gene duplicated independently in each lineage. Consequently, Arabidopsis PHYB mutants cannot be considered strictly equivalent to the tomato tri mutants, which appear to be mutated at the PHYB1 locus.

The RT-qPCR analysis revealed that several senescence-associated genes, including OsORE1 and OsEIN3, were significantly up-regulated in osphyB-2 mutants, indicating that OsPhyB also inhibits leaf senescence, like Arabidopsis PhyB. We also found that leaf segments of osphyB-2 senesced faster even under light conditions.

To sense changes in the light environment, plants have developed various photoreceptors, including the red/far-red light-absorbing phytochromes and blue light-absorbing cryptochromes. A wide variety of physiological responses, including most light responses, also are modulated by circadian rhythms that are generated by an endogenous oscillator, the circadian clock. To provide information on local time, circadian clocks are synchronized and entrained by environmental time cues, of which light is among the most important. Light-driven entrainment of the Arabidopsis circadian clock has been shown to be mediated by phytochrome A (phyA), phytochrome B (phyB), and cryptochromes 1 and 2, thus affirming the roles of these photoreceptors as input regulators to the plant circadian clock. Here we show that the expression of PHYB::LUC reporter genes containing the promoter and 5' untranslated region of the tobacco NtPHYB1 or Arabidopsis AtPHYB genes fused to the luciferase (LUC) gene exhibit robust circadian oscillations in transgenic plants. We demonstrate that the abundance of PHYB RNA retains this circadian regulation and use a PHYB::Luc fusion protein to show that the rate of PHYB synthesis is also rhythmic. The abundance of bulk PHYB protein, however, exhibits only weak circadian rhythmicity, if any. These data suggest that photoreceptor gene expression patterns may be significant in the daily regulation of plant physiology and indicate an unexpectedly intimate relationship between the components of the input pathway and the putative circadian clock mechanism in higher plants."

We found that red light inhibits root elongation approximately 35% in etiolated seedlings and that this response is controlled by phytochromes. Roots from dark- and light-grown double mutants (phyAB) and light-grown phyB seedlings have reduced elongation rates compared with wild type. In addition, roots from these seedlings (dark/light-grown phyAB and light-grown phyB) have reduced rates of gravitropic curvature compared with wild type.

Under RL, the lsd1 mutant released more ROS and SA and displayed a stronger cell death rate than the hy5 mutant. It was shown that active LSD1 converted into inactive form by changing the redox status of the plastoquinone pool, and HY5 interacted with phytochrome B (phyB) to promote PCD in response to RL.

Neighboring plants compete for limited light resources, and their presence is detected by the phytochrome photoreceptors as a reduced ratio of red: far-red light. One common response to shade is increased elongation of petioles and internodes to compete with their neighbors. While the phytochrome family, phyB in particular, has been well studied in Arabidopsis, information about the other phytochrome family members is limited, especially in sympodial crop plants such as tomato, that have a very different architecture from that of the model plant. To study the tomato phytochrome family we took advantage of several existing mutants and generated an artificial miRNA (amiRNA) line to target SlPHYE, the remaining phytochrome B subfamily member with no currently available mutant line. Here, we characterize internode elongation and shade avoidance phenotypes of the SlPHYE amiRNA line (PHYE amiRNA). In addition, higher order phytochrome subfamily B mutants were generated with the PHYE amiRNA line to investigate the role of SlphyE within the phyB subfamily. We find that the PHYE amiRNA line has no detectable phenotype on its own, however in higher order combinations with SlphyB1 and/or SlphyB2 there are notable defects in shade avoidance. Most notably, we find that the triple mutant combination of SlPHYE amiRNA, SlphyB1, and SlphyB2 has a phenotype that is much stronger than the SlphyB1 SlphyB2 double, showing constitutive shade avoidance and little to no response to shade. This indicates that SlphyE is required for the shade avoidance response in the absence of SlphyB1 and SlphyB2."

Evidence for a relatively direct pathway has been provided by the binding of one member of the family, phyB, to a promoter-element-bound, basic helix-loop-helix protein, PIF3, specifically upon light-induced conversion of the photoreceptor molecule to its biologically active conformer (Pfr). Here, we show that phyA also binds selectively and reversibly to PIF3 upon photoconversion to Pfr, but that the apparent affinity of PIF3 for phyA is 10-fold lower than for phyB. This result is consistent with previous in vivo data from PIF3-deficient Arabidopsis, indicating that PIF3 has a major role in phyB signaling, but a more minor role in phyA signaling. We also show that phyB binds stoichiometrically to PIF3 at an equimolar ratio, suggesting that the resultant complex is the unit active in transcriptional regulation at target promoters. Deletion mapping suggests that a 37-aa segment present at the N terminus of phyB, but absent from phyA, contributes strongly to the high binding affinity of phyB for PIF3. Conversely, deletion mapping and point mutation analysis of PIF3 for determinants involved in recognition of phyB indicates that the PAS domain of PIF3 is a major contributor to this interaction, but that a second determinant in the C-terminal domain is also necessary."

The phytochrome polypeptide has two domains: the amino-terminal photosensory domain with a chromophore and the carboxy-terminal domain which contains signalling motifs such as a kinase domain. The latter is widely believed to transduce the signal to downstream components. Here we show that the C-terminal domain of Arabidopsis phytochrome B (phyB), which is known as the most important member of the phytochrome family, is not directly involved in signal transduction. The N-terminal domain isolated from phyB, when dimerized and localized in the nucleus, triggered full phyB responses with much higher photosensitivity than the full-length phyB.

Early phytochrome signaling events include the translocation of phytochromes from the cytoplasm to subnuclear domains called photobodies and the degradation of antagonistically acting phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs). We recently identified a key phytochrome signaling component, HEMERA (HMR), that is essential for both phytochrome B (phyB) localization to photobodies and PIF degradation. However, the signaling mechanism linking phytochromes and HMR is unknown. Here we show that phytochromes directly interact with HMR to promote HMR protein accumulation in the light. HMR binds more strongly to the active form of phytochromes. This interaction is mediated by the photosensory domains of phytochromes and two phytochrome-interacting regions in HMR. Missense mutations in either HMR or phyB that alter the phytochrome/HMR interaction can also change HMR levels and photomorphogenetic responses. HMR accumulation in a constitutively active phyB mutant (YHB) is required for YHB-dependent PIF3 degradation in the dark. Our genetic and biochemical studies strongly support a novel phytochrome signaling mechanism in which photoactivated phytochromes directly interact with HMR and promote HMR accumulation, which in turn mediates the formation of photobodies and the degradation of PIFs to establish photomorphogenesis."

The ability of seeds to accurately respond to light is vital for plant survival. However, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. In this study, we reveal a circuit of triple feed-forward loops adopted by Arabidopsis seeds to exclusively repress germination in dark conditions and precisely initiate germination under diverse light conditions. We identify that de-etiolated 1 (DET1), an evolutionarily conserved protein, is a central repressor of light-induced seed germination. Genetic analysis demonstrates that DET1 functions upstream of long hypocotyl in far-red 1 (HFR1) and phytochrome interacting factor 1 (PIF1), the key positive and negative transcription regulators in seed germination. We further find that DET1 and constitutive photomorphogenic 10 (COP10) target HFR1 for protein degradation by assembling a COP10-DET1-damaged DNA binding protein 1-cullin4 E3 ligase complex. Moreover, DET1 and COP10 directly interact with and promote the protein stability of PIF1. Computational modeling reveals that phytochrome B (phyB)-DET1-HFR1-PIF1 and phyB-DET1-Protease-PIF1 are new signaling pathways, independent of the previously identified phyB-PIF1 pathway, respectively mediating the rapid and time-lapse responses to light irradiation. The model-simulated results are highly consistent with their experimental validations, suggesting that our mathematical model captures the essence of Arabidopsis seed germination networks.

To answer this question, we established transgenic Arabidopsis lines in which the cry2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion was expressed under the control of organ/tissue-specific promoters in a cry2-deficient mutant background. Analysis of these lines revealed that expression of cry2-GFP in vascular bundles, but not in epidermis or mesophyll, rescued the late flowering phenotype.

In response to light, SFPS-RFP (red fluorescent protein) colocalizes with phyB-GFP in photobodies. sfps loss-of-function plants are hyposensitive to red, far-red, and blue light, and flower precociously. SFPS colocalizes with U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated factors including U2AF65B, U2A', and U2AF35A in nuclear speckles, suggesting SFPS might be involved in the 3' splice site determination. SFPS regulates pre-mRNA splicing of a large number of genes, of which many are involved in regulating light signaling, photosynthesis, and the circadian clock under both dark and light conditions. In vivo RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays revealed that SFPS associates with EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) mRNA, a critical link between light signaling and the circadian clock. Moreover, PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) transcription factor genes act downstream of SFPS, as the quadruple pif mutant pifq suppresses defects of sfps mutants.

This finding is consistent with increased glyphosate sensitivity and glyphosate-induced shikimate accumulation in low R:FR light, and the induction of genes encoding enzymes of the shikimate pathway in high R:FR light. Expression of the shikimate pathway genes exhibited diurnal oscillation and this oscillation was altered in the phyB mutant. Furthermore, transcript analysis suggested that this diurnal oscillation was not only dependent on phyB but was also due to circadian regulatory mechanisms.

Electron microscopic in situ localizations and in vitro sequestering experiments showed that phytochrome A was able to sequester in yeast. On the electron microscopic level, the sequestered areas of phytochrome from etiolated plants and yeast are indistinguishable. The sequestering reaction in yeast is independent of the formation of the far-red light absorbing form of phytochrome. Therefore, we discuss a new model for this reaction in plants.

However, the mechanisms by which the phytochromes regulate vegetative development in more mature plants are less well understood. Pea (Pisum sativum) mutant plants lacking phytochromes A and B, the two phytochromes present in this species, develop severe defects later in development, including short, thick, distorted internodes and reduced leaf expansion, chlorophyll content and CAB gene transcript level. Studies presented here indicate that many of these defects in phyA phyB mutant plants appear to be due to elevated ethylene production, and suggest that an important role of the phytochromes in pea is to restrict ethylene production to a level that does not inhibit vegetative growth. Mutant phyA phyB plants produce significantly more ethylene than WT plants, and application of an ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor rescued many aspects of the phyA phyB mutant phenotype. This deregulation of ethylene production in phy-deficient plants appears likely to be due, at least in part, to the elevated transcript levels of key ethylene-biosynthesis genes. The phytochrome A photoreceptor appears to play a prominent role in the regulation of ethylene production, as phyA, but not phyB, single-mutant plants also exhibit a phenotype consistent with elevated ethylene production. Potential interactions between ethylene and secondary plant hormones in the control of the phy-deficient mutant phenotype were explored, revealing that ethylene may inhibit stem elongation in part by reducing gibberellin levels."

In response to vegetational shading shade-intolerant plants such as Arabidopsis display a suite of developmental responses known as the shade-avoidance syndrome (SAS). The phytochrome B (phyB) photoreceptor is the major light sensor to mediate this adaptive response. Control of the SAS occurs in part with phyB, which controls protein abundance of phytochrome-interacting factors 4 and 5 (PIF4 and PIF5) directly. The shade-avoidance response also requires rapid biosynthesis of auxin and its transport to promote elongation growth. The identification of genome-wide PIF5-binding sites during shade avoidance revealed that this bHLH transcription factor regulates the expression of a subset of previously identified SAS genes. Moreover our study suggests that PIF4 and PIF5 regulate elongation growth by controlling directly the expression of genes that code for auxin biosynthesis and auxin signaling components."

This interaction is required to precisely modulate the timing of CO accumulation and, consequently, to maintain low levels of FLOWERING LOCUS T expression during the first part of the day. The data presented here demonstrate that HOS1 is involved in the red light-mediated degradation of CO that takes place in the early stages of the daylight period. Our results show that phytochrome B (phyB) is able to regulate flowering time, acting in the phloem companion cells, as previously described for CO and HOS1.

Chory [1993] Plant Cell 5: 147-157). When dormant seeds of each genotype imbibed in the dark on aqueous agar plates, the hy3 (phyB) mutant did not germinate, whereas the fre1 (phyA) mutant germinated at a rate of 50 to 60%, and the wild type (WT) germinated at a rate of 60 to 70%. By contrast, seeds of all genotypes germinated to nearly 100% when plated in continuous irradiation with white or red light. When plated in continuous far-red light, however, frequencies of seed germination of the WT and the fre1 and hy3 mutants averaged 14, nearly 0, and 47%, respectively, suggesting that PhyB in the red-absorbing form prevents PhyA-dependent germination under continuous far-red light. When irradiated briefly with red or far-red light after imbibition for 1 h, a typical photoreversible effect on seed germination was observed in the fre1 mutant and the WT but not in the hy3 mutant. In contrast, when allowed to imbibe in the dark for 24 to 48 h and exposed to red light, the seed germination frequencies of the hy3 mutant were more than 40%. Immunoblot analyses of the mutant seeds showed that PhyB apoprotein accumulated in dormant seeds of the WT and the fre1 mutant as much as in the seeds that had imbibed. In contrast, PhyA apoprotein, although detected in etiolated seedlings grown in the dark for 5 d, was not detectable in the dormant seeds of the WT and the hy3 mutant. The above physiological and immunochemical evidence indicates that PhyB in the far-red-absorbing form was stored in the Arabidopsis seeds and resulted in germination in the dark. Hence, PhyA does not play any role in dark germination but induces germination under continuous irradiation with far-red light. Finally, we examined seeds from a signal transduction mutant, det1, and a det1/hy3 double mutant. The det1 seeds exhibited photoreversible responses of germination on aqueous agar plates, and the det1/hy3 double mutant seeds did not. Hence, DET1 is likely to act in a distinct pathway from PhyB in the photoregulation of seed germination."

Geographical subdivision between tropical and subtropical O. rufipogon was found for all of the photoperiod genes in plants divided by the Tropic of Cancer (TOC). All of these genes, except for PhyB, were characterized by the existence of clades that split a long time ago and that corresponded to latitudinal subdivisions, and revealed a likely diversifying selection. Ssp. indica showed close affinity to tropical O. rufipogon for all genes, while ssp. japonica, which has a much wider range of distribution, displayed complex patterns of differentiation from O. rufipogon, which reflected various agricultural needs in relation to crop yield. In japonica, all genes, except Hd3a, were genetically differentiated at the TOC, while geographical subdivision occurred at 31°N in Hd3a, probably the result of varying photoperiods. Many other features of the photoperiod genes revealed domestication signatures, which included high linkage disequilibrium (LD) within genes, the occurrence of frequent and recurrent non-functional Hd1 mutants in cultivated rice, crossovers between subtropical and tropical alleles of Hd1, and significant LD between Hd1 and Hd3a in japonica and indica."

Thus, a better understanding of the regulation of primary metabolism by photoreceptors has profound implications for agricultural practices and management. This study aims at identifying the role of light signaling in the regulation of primary metabolism, with an emphasis on starch. We first screened seven cryptochromes and phytochromes mutants for starch phenotype. The phyAB mutant showed impairment in starch accumulation while its biomass, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and leaf anatomy were unaffected, this deficiency being present over the whole vegetative growth period. Mutation of plastidial nucleoside diphosphate kinase-2 (NDPK2), acting downstream of phytochromes, also caused a deficit in starch accumulation. Besides, the glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase small subunit (APS1) was down-regulated in phyAB. Those results suggest that PHYAB affect starch accumulation through NDPK2 and APS1. Then, we determined changes in starch and primary metabolites in single phyA, single phyB, double phyAB grown in light conditions differing in light intensity and/or light spectral content. PHYA is involved in starch accumulation in all the examined light conditions, whereas PHYB only exhibits a role under low light intensity (44 ± 1 μmol m-2 s-1) or low R:FR (11.8 ± 0.6). PCA analysis of the metabolic profiles in the mutants and wild type (WT) suggested that PHYB acts as a major regulator of the leaf metabolic status in response to light intensity. Overall, we propose that PHYA and PHYB signaling play essential roles in the control of primary metabolism in Arabidopsis leaves in response to light."

Auxin signaling and ABCB19 protein levels, hypocotyl growth rates, and apical hook opening were measured in mutant and wild-type seedlings exposed to a range of red and blue light conditions. Ectopic/overexpression of ABCB19 (B19OE) greatly increased auxin in the hypocotyl, which reduced the sensitivity of hypocotyl growth specifically to blue light in long-term assays and red light in high-resolution, short-term assays. Loss of ABCB19 partially suppressed the cry1 hypocotyl growth phenotype in blue light. Hypocotyl growth of B19OE seedlings in red light was very similar to phyB mutants. Altered auxin distribution in B19OE seedlings also affected the opening of the apical hook. The cry1 and phyB photoreceptor mutations both increased ABCB19 protein levels at the plasma membrane, as measured by confocal microscopy. The B19OE plant proved to be a useful tool for determining aspects of the mechanism by which light, acting through cry1 or phyB, influences the auxin transport process to control hypocotyl growth during de-etiolation."

In this study, we describe the complete in vivo complement of homodimeric and heterodimeric type II phytochromes. Unexpectedly, phyC and phyE do not homodimerize and are present in seedlings only as heterodimers with phyB and phyD. Roles in light regulation of hypocotyl length, leaf area, and flowering time are demonstrated for heterodimeric phytochromes containing phyC or phyE. Heterodimers of phyC and chromophoreless phyB are inactive, indicating that phyC subunits require spectrally intact dimer partners to be active themselves. Consistent with the obligate heterodimerization of phyC and phyE, phyC is made unstable by removal of its phyB binding partner, and overexpression of phyE results in accumulation of phyE monomers. Following a pulse of red light, phyA, phyB, phyC, and phyD interact in vivo with the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3 basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, and this interaction is FR reversible. Therefore, most or all of the type I and type II phytochromes, including heterodimeric forms, appear to function through PIF-mediated pathways.

Accordingly, we tested ARR4 and other members of the type-A ARR family for roles in clock function and show that ARR4 and its closest relative, ARR3, act redundantly in the Arabidopsis thaliana circadian system. Loss of ARR3 and ARR4 lengthens the period of the clock even in the absence of light, demonstrating that they do so independently of active phyB. In addition, in white light, arr3,4 mutants show a leading phase similar to phyB mutants, suggesting that circadian light input is modulated by the interaction of phyB with ARR4. Although type-A ARRs are involved in cytokinin signaling, the circadian defects appear to be independent of cytokinin, as exogenous cytokinin affects the phase but not the period of the clock. Therefore, ARR3 and ARR4 are critical for proper circadian period and define an additional level of regulation of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis."

Photoperiod detection allows plants to anticipate the arrival of the next season, whereas light quality, mainly the red to far-red ratio (R:FR), is an early signal of competition by neighbouring plants. phyB represses flowering by antagonising CO at the transcriptional and post-translational levels. A low R:FR decreases active phyB and consequently increases active CO, which in turn activates the expression of FT, the plant florigen. Other phytochromes like phyD and phyE seem to have redundant roles with phyB. PFT1, the MED25 subunit of the plant Mediator complex, has been proposed to act in the light-quality pathway that regulates flowering time downstream of phyB. However, whether PFT1 signals through CO and its specific mechanism are unclear. Here we show that CO-dependent and -independent mechanisms operate downstream of phyB, phyD and phyE to promote flowering, and that PFT1 is equally able to promote flowering by modulating both CO-dependent and -independent pathways. Our data are consistent with the role of PFT1 as an activator of CO transcription, and also of FT transcription, in a CO-independent manner. Our transcriptome analysis is also consistent with CO and FT genes being the most important flowering targets of PFT1. Furthermore, comparison of the pft1 transcriptome with transcriptomes after fungal and herbivore attack strongly suggests that PFT1 acts as a hub, integrating a variety of interdependent environmental stimuli, including light quality and jasmonic acid-dependent defences."

Here, using a glucocorticoid receptor-based fusion protein system, we demonstrate that both photoactivation and nuclear translocation combined are necessary and sufficient for the biological function of phyB. Conversely, neither artificial nuclear translocation of non-photoactivated phyB nor artificial retention of photoactivated phyB in the cytosol provides detectable biological activity. Together these data indicate that signal transfer from photoactivated phyB to its primary signaling partner(s) is localized in the nucleus, and conversely suggest the absence of a cytosolic pathway from photoactivated phyB to light-responsive genes."

It is well established that the phyB mutant has a constitutively early flowering phenotype. However, we have shown that the early flowering phenotype of phyB is temperature-dependent. We have established that this temperature-sensitive flowering response defines a pathway that appears to be independent of the autonomous-FLC pathway. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the phytochromes control the expression of the floral promoter FT. We have also shown that other phyB-controlled responses, including petiole elongation, are not sensitive to the same temperature change.

We investigated whether VLFR, LFR, and HIR are genetically coregulated. The Arabidopsis enhanced very-low-fluence response1 mutant, obtained in a novel screening under hourly far-red light pulses, showed enhanced VLFR of hypocotyl growth inhibition, cotyledon unfolding, blocking of greening, and anthocyanin synthesis. However, eve1 showed reduced LFR and HIR. eve1 was found allelic to the brassinosteroid biosynthesis mutant dim/dwarf1. The analysis of both the brassinosteroid mutant det2 in the Columbia background (where VLFR are repressed) and the phyA eve1 double mutant indicates that the negative effect of brassinosteroid mutations on LFR requires phyA signaling in the VLFR mode but not the expression of the VLFR. Under sunlight, hypocotyl growth of eve1 showed little difference with the wild type but failed to respond to canopy shadelight. We propose that the opposite regulation of VLFR versus LFR and HIR could be part of a context-dependent mechanism of adjustment of sensitivity to light signals."

The induction of randomization was confirmed using lines that express to different levels PHYA and PHYB cDNAs. Overexpression of PHYA cDNAs induced randomization of hypocotyl orientation in the dark. Dark randomization was also seen in the phyB-1 mutant but not in two other phyB alleles, suggesting that dark randomization in the phyB-1 line may be due to a second mutation. When germination was induced by gibberellin, rather than exposure to brief white light, randomization in the dark associated with phytochrome A overproduction was not observed but was retained in the phyB-1 mutant. Overexpression of PHYB cDNAs induced a light-dependent randomization of hypocotyl orientation that responded to R:far-red light ratio.

ROS biosynthesis and metabolism should be tightly regulated, because they often impose oxidative damage on biological molecules, such as DNA and proteins, and on cellular structures. It is known that at high temperatures, ROS rapidly accumulate in plant tissues. Thus, a quick activation of ROS-scavenging systems is necessary for thermal adaptation. However, it is largely unknown how the thermo-induced ROS-detoxifying capacity is enhanced by environmental factors at the molecular level. Here, we demonstrated that environmental light primes the thermally induced ROS detoxification process for development of thermotolerance in Arabidopsis. While the ROS detoxification capacity was markedly enhanced in light-pre-treated plants at high temperatures, its enhancement was not as evident in dark-pre-treated plants. ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 2 (APX2) is a representative ROS-scavenging enzyme that is activated under heat stress conditions. It was observed that the thermal induction of the APX2 gene was more prominent in light-pre-treated plants than in dark-pre-treated plants. Notably, the light-gated APX2 gene induction was compromised in Arabidopsis mutants lacking the red light photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB). Furthermore, exogenous application of the antioxidant ascorbate recovered the heat-sensitive phenotype of the phyB mutant. These observations indicate that light-primed ROS-detoxifying capability is intimately linked with the induction of thermotolerance. We propose that the phyB-mediated light priming of ROS detoxification is a key component of thermotolerant adaptation in plants."

To test the functionality of phytochrome A and B at the molecular level recombinant, yeast-derived phytochrome-phycocyanobilin adducts (phyA, phyB) and oat phytochrome A (phyA) were microinjected into etiolated aurea tomato seedlings. Subsequent to microinjection anthocyanin and chlorophyll accumulation was monitored as well as beta-glucuronidase (GUS) expression mediated by light-regulated promoters (chs, chlorophyll a/b binding protein (lhcb1) and ferredoxin NADP+ oxidoreductase (fnn). Microinjection of phyA under white light conditions caused anthocyanin and chlorophyll accumulation and mediated chs-GUS, lhcb 1-GUS and fnr-GUS expression. Microinjection of phyB under identical conditions induced chlorophyll accumulation and mediated lhcb 1-GUS and fnr-GUS expression but neither anthocyanin accumulation nor chs-GUS expression were observed. The characterization of Arabidopsis phytochrome mutants and the microinjection experiments suggested that phyB cannot induce the accumulation of juvenile anthocyanin. Microinjections under far-red light conditions demonstrated that phyA can act independently of other photoreceptors. By contrast, phyB injections under red light conditions indicated that phyB needs interactions with other photoreceptors to mediate a rapid and efficient de-etiolation signal."

Using single and multiple mutants of phytochromes, it is shown here that different phytochromes contributed to germination differently, depending on seed-maturation conditions. Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type seeds that were matured under cool temperatures were intensely dormant compared with seeds matured at warmer temperature, and this dormancy was broken only after warm seed-stratification followed by cold seed-stratification. The warm-cold stratification broke dormancy in fresh seeds but not in dry after-ripened seeds. Functional PHYB and PHYD were necessary to break cool-induced dormancy, which indicates a previously unknown and ecologically important function for PHYD. Disruption of PHYA in combination with PHYD (but not PHYB) restored germination to near wild-type levels, indicating that PHYA contributes to the maintenance of cool-induced dormancy on a phyD background. Effects of seed-maturation temperature were much stronger than effects of seed-maturation photoperiod. PHYB contributed to germination somewhat more strongly in seeds matured under short days, whereas PHYD contributed to germination somewhat more strongly in seeds matured under long days. The variable contributions of different phytochromes to germination as a function of seed-maturation conditions reveal further functional diversification of the phytochromes during the process of germination. This study identifies among the first genes to be associated with maternal environmental effects on germination."

High-density growth did not reduce the flowering time of phyB mutants, but did affect that of spy mutants. Neither spy nor phyB suppressed the shortening of rosette leaves at high densities; however, spy suppressed flowering stem shortening. Moreover, spy suppressed the reduction of silique number at high densities, while and phyB promoted the decrease.

Phytochromes are known to be involved in the light-regulated biosynthesis of some alkaloids. Phytochromes are soluble chromoproteins that function in the absorption of red and far-red light and the transduction of intracellular signals during light-regulated plant development. De novo assembly of the nuclear genome of R. stricta recovered 45,641 contigs greater than 1000bp long, which were used in constructing a local database. Five sequences belonging to Arabidopsis thaliana phytochrome gene family (i.e., AtphyABCDE) were used to identify R. stricta contigs with phytochrome-like sequences using BLAST. This led to the identification of three contigs with phytochrome-like sequences covering AtphyA-, AtphyC- and AtphyE-like full-length genes. Annotation of the three sequences showed that each contig consists of one phytochrome-like gene with three exons and two introns. BLASTn and BLASTp results indicated that RsphyA mRNA and protein sequences had homologues in Wrightia coccinea and and Solanum tuberosum, respectively. RsphyC-like mRNA and protein sequence were homologous to Vitis vinifera and Vitis riparia. RsphyE-like mRNA coding and protein sequences were homologous to Ipomoea nil. Multiple-sequence alignment of phytochrome proteins indicated a homology with 30 sequences from 23 different species of flowering plants. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that each R. stricta phytochrome gene is related to the same phytochrome gene of other flowering plants.

A population segregating for Ma3 and ma3 was created and used to identify two randomly amplified polymorphic DNA markers linked to Ma3. These two markers were cloned and mapped in a recombinant inbred population as restriction fragment length polymorphisms. cDNA clones of PHYA and PHYC were cloned and sequenced from a cDNA library prepared from green sorghum leaves. Using a genome-walking technique, a 7941-bp partial sequence of PHYB, was determined from genomic DNA from ma3 sorghum. PHYA, PHYB, and PHYC all mapped to the same linkage group.

Light induces photomorphogenesis, leading to inhibition of hypocotyl growth, whereas GAs promote etiolated growth, characterized by increased hypocotyl elongation. The mechanism underlying this antagonistic interaction remains unclear. Here we report on the central role of the Arabidopsis thaliana nuclear transcription factor PIF4 (encoded by PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4) in the positive control of genes mediating cell elongation and show that this factor is negatively regulated by the light photoreceptor phyB (ref. 4) and by DELLA proteins that have a key repressor function in GA signalling. Our results demonstrate that PIF4 is destabilized by phyB in the light and that DELLAs block PIF4 transcriptional activity by binding the DNA-recognition domain of this factor. We show that GAs abrogate such repression by promoting DELLA destabilization, and therefore cause a concomitant accumulation of free PIF4 in the nucleus. Consistent with this model, intermediate hypocotyl lengths were observed in transgenic plants over-accumulating both DELLAs and PIF4. Destabilization of this factor by phyB, together with its inactivation by DELLAs, constitutes a protein interaction framework that explains how plants integrate both light and GA signals to optimize growth and development in response to changing environments."

The mechanism by which PIF3 relays phy signals, both early after initial light exposure and later during long-term irradiation, is not understood. Using transgenically expressed PIF3 variants, carrying site-specific amino acid substitutions that block the protein from binding either to DNA, phyA, and/or phyB, we examined the involvement of PIF3 in early, phy-induced marker gene expression and in modulating long-term, phy-imposed inhibition of hypocotyl cell elongation under prolonged, continuous irradiation. We describe an unanticipated dual mechanism of PIF3 action that involves the temporal uncoupling of its two most central molecular functions. We find that in early signaling, PIF3 acts positively as a transcription factor, exclusively requiring its DNA-binding capacity. Contrary to previous proposals, PIF3 functions as a constitutive coactivator in this process, without the need for phy binding and subsequent phy-induced modifications. This finding implies that another factor(s) is conditionally activated by phy and functions in concert with PIF3, to induce target gene transcription. In contrast, during long-term irradiations, PIF3 acts exclusively through its phyB-interacting capacity to control hypocotyl cell elongation, independently of its ability to bind DNA. Unexpectedly, PIF3 uses this capacity to regulate phyB protein abundance (and thereby global photosensory sensitivity) to modulate this long-term response rather than participating directly in the transduction chain as a signaling intermediate."

In Arabidopsis thaliana the participation of phytochromes A and B (phyA and phyB) in the early phase of cry1 action was investigated by determining the effects of phyA, phyB and hy1 mutations on a cry1-dependent membrane depolarization, which is caused by the activation of plasma-membrane anion channels within seconds of blue light treatment. High-resolution growth measurements were also performed to determine the timing of the requirement for phytochrome in cry1-mediated growth inhibition, which is causally linked to the preceding anion-channel activation. A null mutation in PHYA impaired the membrane depolarization and prevented the early cry1-dependent phase of growth inhibition as effectively and with the same time course as mutations in CRY1. Thus, phyA is necessary for cry1/cry2 to activate anion channels within the first few seconds of blue light and to suppress hypocotyl elongation for at least 120 min. This finding furthers the notion of an intimate mechanistic association between the cry and phy receptors in mediating light responses. The absence of phyB did not affect the depolarization or growth inhibition during this time frame. Instead, double mutant analyses showed that the phyB mutation suppressed the early growth phenotypes of both phyA and cry1 seedlings. This result is consistent with the emerging view that the prevailing growth rate of a stem is a compromise between light-dependent inhibitory and promotive influences. It appears that phyB opposes the cry1/phyA-mediated inhibition by promoting growth during at least the first 120 min of blue light treatment."

However, the amino-terminal half of phyB fused to green fluorescent protein (NGB) is hypersensitive to light despite its inability to localize to photobodies. Therefore, the significance of photobodies in regulating hypocotyl growth remains debatable. Accumulating evidence indicates that under diurnal conditions, photoactivated phyB persists into darkness to inhibit hypocotyl elongation. Here, we examine whether photobodies are involved in inhibiting hypocotyl growth in darkness by comparing the PBG and NGB lines after the red light-to-dark transition. Surprisingly, after the transition from 10 μmol m-2 s-1 red light to darkness, PBG inhibits hypocotyl elongation three times longer than NGB. The disassembly of photobodies in PBG hypocotyl nuclei correlates tightly with the accumulation of the growth-promoting transcription factor PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR3 (PIF3). Destabilizing photobodies by either decreasing the light intensity or adding monochromatic far-red light treatment before the light-to-dark transition leads to faster PIF3 accumulation and a dramatic reduction in the capacity for hypocotyl growth inhibition in PBG. In contrast, NGB is defective in PIF3 degradation, and its hypocotyl growth in the dark is nearly unresponsive to changes in light conditions. Together, our results support the model that photobodies are required for the prolonged, light-dependent inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in the dark by repressing PIF3 accumulation and by stabilizing the far-red light-absorbing form of phyB. Our study suggests that photobody localization patterns of phyB could serve as instructive cues that control light-dependent photomorphogenetic responses in the dark."

In Arabidopsis, this response (shade avoidance syndrome, SAS) is controlled by phytochromes (particularly phyB), and is dependent on the TAA1 pathway of auxin biosynthesis. However, when grown in real canopies, we found that phyB mutants and mutants deficient in TAAI (sav3) still display robust SAS responses to increased planting density and leaf shading. The SAS morphology (leaf hyponasty and reduced lamina/petiole ratio) could be phenocopied by exposing plants to blue light attenuation. These responses to blue light attenuation required the UV-A/blue light photoreceptor cry1. Moreover, they were mediated through mechanisms that showed only limited overlap with the pathways recruited by phyB inactivation. In particular, pathways for polar auxin transport, auxin biosynthesis and gibberellin signaling that are involved in SAS responses to low R:FR were not required for the SAS responses to blue light depletion. By contrast, the brassinosteroid response appeared to be required for the full expression of the SAS phenotype under low blue light. The phyB and cry1 inactivation pathways appeared to converge in their requirement for the basic/helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs 4 and 5 (PIF4 and PIF5) to elicit the SAS phenotype. Our results suggest that blue light is an important control of SAS responses, and that PIF4 and PIF5 are critical hubs for a diverse array of signaling routes that control plant architecture in canopies."

It is ubiquitously expressed in pea tissues with high expression in radicles. The amount of total mRNA transcripts representing multiple Ran family members increased in response to very low-fluence R, while the amount of mRNA transcript encoding PsRan1 specifically was not affected by various light treatments. In addition, Ran genes in Arabidopsis were also differentially expressed in various mutants defective in phytochromes or the light-responding HY5 protein, such as phyA, phyB, and hy5.

For instance, 15 min R h-1 (terminated with a FR pulse) were almost as effective as continuous R, whereas 15 min of FR h-1 caused less than 30% of the effect of continuous FR.

Here evidence is presented that ARR4 directly modulates the activity state of phyB in planta, not only under inductive but also under extended irradiation with red light. Mutation of the phosphorylatable aspartate to asparagine within the receiver domain creates a version of ARR4 that negatively affects photomorphogenesis. Additional evidence suggests that ARR4 activity is regulated by a phosphorelay mechanism that depends on the AHK family of cytokinin receptors. Accordingly, the ability of ARR4 to function on phyB is modified by exogenous application of cytokinin. These results implicate a cross-talk between cytokinin and light signalling mediated by ARR4.

The A-ring acts mainly as the anchor for ligation to PHYB, because the modification of the side chains at the C2 and C3 positions did not significantly influence the formation or difference spectra of adducts. In contrast, the side chains of the B- and C-rings are crucial to position the chromophore properly in the chromophore pocket of PHYB and for photoreversible spectral changes. The side-chain structure of the D-ring is required for the photoreversible spectral change of the adducts. When methyl and ethyl groups at the C17 and C18 positions are replaced with an n-propyl, n-pentyl, or n-octyl group, respectively, the photoreversible spectral change of the adducts depends on the length of the side chains.

Phytochromes have important roles in developmental events such as the switch to flowering, the timing of which can be crucial for the reproductive success of the plant. Analysis of phyB mutants has revealed that phyB plays a major role in this process. We have recently shown, however, that the flowering phenotype of the phyB monogenic mutant is temperature dependent. A modest reduction in temperature to 16 degrees C was sufficient to abolish the phyB mutant early-flowering phenotype present at 22 degrees C. Using mutants null for one or more phytochrome species, we have now shown that phyA, phyD, and phyE, play greater roles with respect to phyB in the control of flowering under cooler conditions. This change in the relative contributions of individual phytochromes appears to be important for maintaining control of flowering in response to modest alterations in ambient temperature. We demonstrate that changes in ambient temperature or photoperiod can alter the hierarchy and/or the functional relationships between phytochrome species. These experiments reveal new roles for phyD and phyE and provide valuable insights into how the phytochromes help to maintain development in the natural environment."

Red-depleted light reflected from neighboring vegetation triggers a shade avoidance response leading to a dramatic change in plant architecture. These changes in light quality are detected by the phytochrome family of photoreceptors. We analyzed global changes in gene expression over time in wild-type, phyB mutant, and phyA phyB double mutant seedlings of Arabidopsis in response to simulated shade. Using pattern fitting software, we identified 301 genes as shade responsive with patterns of expression corresponding to one of various physiological response modes. A requirement for a consistent pattern of expression across 12 chips in this way allowed more subtle changes in gene expression to be considered meaningful. A number of previously characterized genes involved in light and hormone signaling were identified as shade responsive, as well as several putative, novel shade-specific signal transduction factors. In addition, changes in expression of genes in a range of pathways associated with elongation growth and stress responses were observed. The majority of shade-responsive genes demonstrated antagonistic regulation by phyA and phyB in response to shade following the pattern of many physiological responses. An analysis of promoter elements of genes regulated in this way identified conserved promoter motifs potentially important in shade regulation."

The ultimate response to an excessive amount of stress is local induction of cell death mechanisms. The death of certain cells can help to maintain tissue homeostasis and enable nutrient remobilization, thus increasing the survival chances of the whole organism in unfavourable environmental conditions. UV radiation is one of the environmental factors that negatively affects the photosynthetic process and triggers cell death. The aim of this work was to evaluate a possible role of the red/far-red light photoreceptors phytochrome A (phyA) and phytochrome B (phyB) and their interrelations during acclimatory responses to UV stress. We showed that UV-C treatment caused a disturbance in photosystem II and a deregulation of photosynthetic pigment content and antioxidant enzymes activities, followed by increased cell mortality rate in phyB and phyAB null mutants. We also propose a regulatory role of phyA and phyB in CO2 assimilation, non-photochemical quenching, reactive oxygen species accumulation and salicylic acid content. Taken together, our results suggest a novel role of phytochromes as putative regulators of cell death and acclimatory responses to UV."

In this study, we isolate a full-length cDNA of PHYB, designated BrPHYB, from Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L. ssp. pekinensis), and we find that BrphyB protein has high amino acid sequence similarity and the closest evolutionary relationship to Arabidopsis thaliana phyB (i.e., AtphyB). Quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR results indicate that the BrPHYB gene is ubiquitously expressed in different tissues under all light conditions. Constitutive expression of the BrPHYB gene in A. thaliana significantly enhances seedling de-etiolation under red- and white-light conditions, and causes dwarf stature in mature plants. Unexpectedly, overexpression of BrPHYB in transgenic A. thaliana resulted in reduced expression of gibberellins biosynthesis genes and delayed flowering under short-day conditions, whereas AtPHYB overexpression caused enhanced expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T and earlier flowering. Our results suggest that BrphyB might play an important role in regulating the development of Chinese cabbage. BrphyB and AtphyB have conserved functions during de-etiolation and vegetative plant growth and divergent functions in the regulation of flowering time."

We found that the number of nodules produced by L. japonicus phyB mutants is significantly reduced compared with the number produced of WT Miyakojima MG20. To explore causes other than photoassimilate production, the possibility that local control by the root genotype occurred was investigated by grafting experiments. The results showed that the shoot and not the root genotype is responsible for root nodule formation. To explore systemic control mechanisms exclusive of photoassimilation, we moved WT MG20 plants from white light to conditions that differed in their ratios of low or high red/far red (R/FR) light. In low R/FR light, the number of MG20 root nodules dramatically decreased compared with plants grown in high R/FR, although photoassimilate content was higher for plants grown under low R/FR. Also, the expression of jasmonic acid (JA) -responsive genes decreased in both low R/FR light-grown WT and white light-grown phyB mutant plants, and it correlated with decreased jasmonoyl-isoleucine content in the phyB mutant. Moreover, both infection thread formation and root nodule formation were positively influenced by JA treatment of WT plants grown in low R/FR light and white light-grown phyB mutants. Together, these results indicate that root nodule formation is photomorphogenetically controlled by sensing the R/FR ratio through JA signaling."

The basis for the mutant phenotype is the enhanced expression of a cytochrome P450 (CYP72B1). bas1-D suppresses a phyB-null allele, but not a phyA-null mutation, and partially suppresses a cryptochrome-null mutation.

In the present study, comparative transcription profiling experiments were performed to assess whether the pattern of gene expression regulated by these alleles accurately reflects the process of photomorphogenesis in wild-type Arabidopsis. Whole-genome transcription profiles of dark-grown phyAphyB seedlings expressing the Y276H mutant of phyB (YHB) revealed that YHB reprograms about 13% of the Arabidopsis transcriptome in a light-independent manner. The YHB-regulated transcriptome proved qualitatively similar to but quantitatively greater than those of wild-type seedlings grown under 15 or 50 micromol m(-2) m(-1) continuous red light (Rc). Among the 2977 genes statistically significant two-fold (SSTF) regulated by YHB in the absence of light include those encoding components of the photosynthetic apparatus, tetrapyrrole/pigment biosynthetic pathways, and early light-responsive signaling factors. Approximately 80% of genes SSTF regulated by Rc were also YHB-regulated. Expression of a notable subset of 346 YHB-regulated genes proved to be strongly attenuated by Rc, indicating compensating regulation by phyC-E and/or other Rc-dependent processes. Since the majority of these 346 genes are regulated by the circadian clock, these results suggest that phyA- and phyB-independent light signaling pathway(s) strongly influence clock output. Together with the unique plastid morphology of dark-grown YHB seedlings, these analyses indicate that the YHB mutant induces constitutive photomorphogenesis via faithful reconstruction of phyB signaling pathways in a light-independent fashion."

Moreover, this suppression by MeJA was particularly effective under red light condition. Mutant analyses suggested that SCF(COI1)-mediated proteolysis was involved in this function. However, MeJA action still remained in the coi1 mutant, and (+)-7-iso-JA-L-Ile, a well-known active form of jasmonate, had a weaker effect than MeJA under the red light condition, suggesting that unknown signaling pathway are present in MeJA-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. EMS mutant screening identified two MeJA-insensitive hypocotyl elongation mutants, jasmonate resistance long hypocotyl 1 (jal1) and jal36, which had mutations in the phytochrome B (PHYB) gene. These analyses suggested that inhibition of hypocotyl elongation by jasmonates is enhanced under red light in phyB dependent manner."

Surprisingly, this effect was larger at very high densities, despite the intense reduction in the red to far-red light ratios and the concomitant narrowed differences in active phytochrome B levels between wild type and transgenics at these densities. Increased PHYB expression not only altered the ability of plants to respond to light signals, but they also modified the light environment itself. This combination resulted in larger effects of enhanced PHYB expression on tuber number and crop photosynthesis at high planting densities. The PHYB transgenics showed higher maximum photosynthesis in leaves of all strata of the canopy, and this effect was largely due to increased leaf stomatal conductance. We propose that enhanced PHYB expression could be used in breeding programs to shift optimum planting densities to higher levels."

We show that MYB30 preferentially interacts with the Pfr (active) forms of the phytochrome A (phyA) and phytochrome B (phyB) holoproteins and that MYB30 levels are induced by phyA and phyB in the light.

In addition, our data indicate that MYB30 interacts with PIFs and that they act additively to repress photomorphogenesis. In summary, our study demonstrates that MYB30 negatively regulates Arabidopsis photomorphogenic development by acting to promote PIF4 and PIF5 protein accumulation under prolonged R light irradiation, thus providing new insights into the complicated but delicate control of PIFs in the responses of plants to their dynamic light environment."

Here, we have identified two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, designated PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR5 (PIF5) and PIF6, which interact specifically with the Pfr form of phyB. These two factors cluster tightly with PIF3 and two other phy-interacting bHLH proteins in a phylogenetic subfamily within the large Arabidopsis bHLH (AtbHLH) family. We have identified a novel sequence motif (designated the active phytochrome binding [APB] motif) that is conserved in these phy-interacting AtbHLHs but not in other noninteractors. Using the isolated domain and site-directed mutagenesis, we have shown that this motif is both necessary and sufficient for binding to phyB. Transgenic expression of the native APB-containing AtbHLH protein, PIF4, in a pif4 null mutant, rescued the photoresponse defect in this mutant, whereas mutated PIF4 constructs with site-directed substitutions in conserved APB residues did not. These data indicate that the APB motif is necessary for PIF4 function in light-regulated seedling development and suggest that conformer-specific binding of phyB to PIF4 via the APB motif is necessary for this function in vivo. Binding assays with the isolated APB domain detected interaction with phyB, but none of the other four Arabidopsis phys. Collectively, the data suggest that the APB domain provides a phyB-specific recognition module within the AtbHLH family, thereby conferring photoreceptor target specificity on a subset of these transcription factors and, thus, the potential for selective signal channeling to segments of the transcriptional network."

Poorly metabolized sugars capable of activating the putative hexokinase sensory function were not effective in eliciting the phytochrome interference response. Overexpressed phyB lacking the chromophore-binding site was also effective at inhibiting the phyA response, especially at higher fluence rates of FR. Overexpressed phyB produces the dominant negative phenotype without any apparent effect on phyA abundance or degradation. It is possible that phyA and phyB interact with a common reaction partner but that either the energy state of the cell or a separate sugar-signaling mechanism modulates the phytochrome-signaling interactions."
