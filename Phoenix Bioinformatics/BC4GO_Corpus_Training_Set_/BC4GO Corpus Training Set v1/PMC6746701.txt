CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) is a highly conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase
from plants to animals and acts as a central repressor of photomorphogenesis in plants.
SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 1 family members (SPA1-SPA4) directly interact with COP1 and
enhance COP1 activity. Despite the presence of a kinase domain at the N-terminus, no COP1-
independent role of SPA proteins has been reported. Here we show that SPA1 acts as a
serine/threonine kinase and directly phosphorylates PIF1 in vitro and in vivo. SPAs are
necessary for the light-induced phosphorylation, ubiquitination and subsequent degradation
of PIF1. Moreover, the red/far-red light photoreceptor phyB interacts with SPA1 through its
C-terminus and enhances the recruitment of PIF1 for phosphorylation. These data provide a
mechanistic view on how the COP1-SPA complexes serve as an example of a cognate kinase-
E3 ligase complex that selectively triggers rapid phosphorylation and removal of its sub-
strates, and how phyB modulates this process to promote photomorphogenesis.

The ubiquitin-26S proteasome system (UPS) plays critical

roles in controlling growth and development of all eukar-
yotes1,2 and is involved in multiple developmental and
environmental
in
Arabidopsis2,3. This system targets speciﬁc proteins by selectively
attaching a polyubiquitin chain by the action of three enzymes:
E1, E2, and E3, and the polyubiquitin chain serves as a tag for
speciﬁc recognition and degradation of the substrate by the UPS
pathway1,2.

including photomorphogenesis

responses,

CONTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) is a
RING ﬁnger protein containing WD40 repeats and a coiled-coil
domain and is highly conserved from plants to mammals4. It is
one of the best characterized E3 ubiquitin ligases with broad roles
as a central repressor of light signaling in plants to cancer biology
in mammals5–7. COP1 interacts with multiple substrates either
directly or indirectly using accessory proteins and targets them
for UPS-mediated degradation. For example, in mammals, COP1
interacts with Tribbles pseudokinases (Trib1-3), and the COP1-
Trib complex then recruits multiple substrates for UPS-mediated
degradation8,9. In plants, COP1 interacts with SUPPRESSOR OF
PHYA-105 1 family members (SPA1-SPA4), and the COP1-SPA
complexes target multiple transcription factors for rapid degra-
dation10. Mutations in COP1 or SPA genes result in either leth-
ality at an early seedling development stage (for cop1 null alleles)
or severe developmental defects including dwarﬁsm and early
ﬂowering11–13. One characteristic phenotype of the COP1-SPA-
related mutants is premature light-induced development even in
the absence of light called constitutive photomorphogenic (cop)
development11. This is because COP1-SPA complex targets
positively acting transcription factors (e.g., HY5/LAF1/HFR1 and
others) for degradation in darkness. In cop1 and spaQ (spa1s-
pa2spa3spa4 quadruple) mutants, the stabilized positively acting
transcription factors promote photomorphogenic development
even in the dark10.

SPA1 was originally identiﬁed from a genetic screen to isolate a
suppressor of a weak phytochrome A mutant phyA-10514,15.
Since then, four SPA (SPA1, SPA2, SPA3 and SPA4) genes have
been characterized with differential roles in plant develop-
ment13,16,17. SPAs contain a ser/thr kinase domain at the N-
terminus, a coiled-coil domain in the middle, and four WD-40
repeats in the C-terminus that serves as an interaction domain
with speciﬁc substrates14. SPAs directly interact with COP1
through their coiled-coil domain and form multiple COP1-SPA
complexes18. Genetic evidence shows that SPAs can enhance the
COP1 activity in vivo. For example, weak alleles of the cop1 spa1
double mutant display strongly enhanced photomorphogenic
phenotypes in the dark, suggesting SPA1 genetically interacts
with COP119,20. In addition, spaQ displays a very similar phe-
notype as a strong allele of cop1 mutant, suggesting the require-
ment of SPAs in COP1 activity in vivo21. In vitro biochemical
assays
the SPA1 coiled-coil domain strongly
enhances the COP1 E3 ligase activity19. In addition, the COP1-
SPA complex associates with CULLIN4, and the CUL4COP1-SPA
promotes degradation of the positively acting transcription fac-
tors in the dark to repress photomorphogenesis22.

showed that

In response to environmental

light signals, the red/far-red
photoreceptors called phytochromes (phy) undergo allosteric
changes in conformation (an inactive Pr to a biologically active
Pfr form) and migrate into the nucleus23,24. The activated phy-
tochromes then interact with the COP1-SPA complex and reor-
ganizes the complex to inhibit the E3 ligase activity25,26. COP1 is
also excluded from the nucleus in response to light27–29, and the
reduction in COP1 in the nucleus as well as the light-induced
inhibition of COP1 activity contribute to the accumulation of the
that promote photo-
positively acting transcription factors
morphogenesis in the light30.

In addition to the inhibition of the COP1-SPA complex, light-
activated phytochromes also directly interact with a group of
bHLH transcription factors called PHYTOCHROME INTER-
ACTING FACTORs (PIFs)31,32. PIFs mainly function negatively
in phytochrome signaling pathways. Moreover, PIFs also regulate
a wide range of plant responses to light32,33. The red-light-
activated phytochromes directly interact with PIFs and trigger
rapid phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation of PIFs to
release photomorphogenic development. In this process, multiple
kinases and E3 ubiquitin ligases participate in selective removal of
PIFs to promote photomorphogenesis32,34.

Among all PIFs, PIF1 is unique as it is the only PIF that
exclusively represses seed germination in the dark35,36. PIF1
interacts with the Pfr forms of both phyA and phyB37, and
undergoes the fastest degradation in response to red light with a
half-life of <2 min among all PIFs38. PIF1 also directly interacts
with the COP1-SPA complex, and both PIF1 and COP1-SPA
complex repress photomorphogenesis in the dark in a synergistic
manner30,39,40. However, upon red-light exposure, PIF1 is ubi-
quitinated by the COP1-SPA complex and is rapidly degraded to
allow seed germination to proceed41. This selective substrate
recognition and ubiquitination by the COP1-SPA complex is
promoted by light-induced PIF1 phosphorylation38. Casein
Kinase 2 (CK2) was previously shown to phosphorylate PIF1
in vitro; however, was not involved in the light-induced phos-
phorylation of PIF142. Therefore, the protein kinase necessary for
the rapid light-induced PIF1 phosphorylation has not been
identiﬁed.

Similar to the mammalian COP1-associated pseudo-kinase,
Trib, plant COP1-associated SPA kinases have no known sub-
strate, although the kinase domain of both Trib and SPAs are
necessary for their biological functions9,43. Here we provide evi-
dence that SPA1, a component of the COP1-SPA E3 ubiquitin
ligase complex itself, acts as a protein kinase. By performing
extensive biochemical, genetic and genomic analyses, we provide
strong evidence that SPA1 is a bona ﬁde serine/threonine kinase
that is necessary for the light-induced phosphorylation of PIF1.
We also provide mechanistic details on how the red/far-red light
photoreceptor phyB directly recruits SPA1 kinase and this
recruitment plays a pivotal role in inducing PIF1 phosphorylation
and degradation to promote seed germination and seedling
development. These data highlight the importance of COP1-
associated kinases not only in enhancing COP1 activity, but also
speciﬁc phosphorylation of their substrates for rapid ubiquitina-
tion and subsequent degradation.

Results
SPA1 shows a protein kinase activity in vitro. Despite the
presence of the majority of the signature sequences of a ser/thr
kinase-like domain at its N-terminus14, no kinase activity has
been reported for SPA proteins. To examine whether SPA1 can
act as a kinase, we puriﬁed the GST and strep-tagged N-terminal
half of SPA1 (SPA1-Kin) containing the ser/thr kinase domain.
The puriﬁed SPA1-Kin domain displayed autophosphorylation
activity in a protein concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1a).
To test whether the kinase domain is necessary for the kinase
activity of SPA1, we created a point mutation in an amino acid
(R517E) on the SPA1 kinase domain, which is conserved in
SPA1 sequences from multiple plants (Supplementary Fig. 1).
This residue is part of a conserved Glu-Arg salt bridge that
deﬁnes eukaryotic protein kinases44, and has recently been shown
to be critical for its biological function in the dark43. We puriﬁed
both the wild type and the mutant GST-SPA1-Kin proteins
and examined their autophosphorylation activities. Results show
a signiﬁcantly reduced auto-phosphorylation activity for the

To examine whether the SPA1-Kin domain can phosphorylate
a substrate, we performed a kinase assay using myelin basic
protein (MBP), which has been widely used as a general substrate
for many kinases45. In vitro kinase assays showed that the SPA1-
Kin domain phosphorylates MBP in vitro in a concentration-
dependent manner (Fig. 1c). Notably,
the SPA1-Kin auto-
phosphorylation activity reduces as the MBP phosphorylation
increases,

relationship in that auto-phosphorylation of a kinase reduces as
the substrate phosphorylation increases.

showing a general

SPA1 can directly phosphorylate PIF1 in vitro. Previously, we
reported that the COP1-SPA1 E3 ligase can interact with PIF1 in
a red light-induced manner and promotes its rapid degradation41.
To test whether PIF1 could be a native substrate of the SPA1
kinase, a strep-tagged full-length SPA1 protein was puriﬁed from
a eukaryotic expression host, Pichia pastoris (Supplementary
Fig. 2a, b), and the kinase assay was performed with PIF1 as a
substrate. PIF1 was strongly phosphorylated by SPA1 in vitro
(Fig. 1d), suggesting that PIF1 might be a bona ﬁde native sub-
strate of SPA1 kinase. SPA1 also phosphorylated PIF1 in an ATP
concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1e, f). Since

SPA1 harbors a predicted ser/thr kinase domain, we further
investigated the nature of PIF1 phosphorylation by acid-base
sensitivity assays (Supplementary Fig. 2c). In the presence of
KOH, PIF1 was dephosphorylated, while PIF1 phosphorylation
was stable in HCl solution, suggesting that SPA1 is a ser/thr
kinase for PIF1.

To examine whether the conserved amino acid mutation
(R517E) on the full-length SPA1 kinase domain affects PIF1
phosphorylation, we puriﬁed the full-length mSPA1 from Pichia
pastoris and performed the kinase assay using PIF1 as a substrate.
The mSPA1 showed signiﬁcantly reduced PIF1 phosphorylation
compared to the wild type SPA1 (Fig. 1g). In addition, the SPA1-
Kin domain alone was able to phosphorylate PIF1, while the
mutant mSPA1-Kin exhibited reduced PIF1 phosphorylation
(Supplementary Fig. 2d). To examine if SPA1 can bind to ATP,
we performed a concentration-dependent ATP binding assay
using TNP-ATP. Results show that both wild type and mutant
form of SPA1-Kin were able to bind to TNP-ATP in a
concentration-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 2e). Both
wild type and mutant SPA1 can directly interact with PIF1
in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 2f, g), suggesting that the reduction
in PIF1 phosphorylation by the mSPA1 mutant is not due to a
reduction in physical
interaction between mSPA1 and PIF1.
Taken together, these data strongly suggest that SPA1 is a bona
ﬁde ser/thr kinase that phosphorylates PIF1 in vitro.

Fig. 2 SPAs are necessary for the light-induced phosphorylation and degradation of PIF1 in vivo. a Immunoblots showing the light-induced phosphorylation
of TAP-PIF1 is defective in the spaQ mutant compared to wild type. Four-day-old dark-grown seedlings were either kept in darkness or exposed to a pulse of
red light (300 μmolm−2) and then incubated in the dark for the duration indicated before being sampled for protein extraction. All dash lines show the dark
position of the PIF1 band. b Immunoblots show a defect in the light-induced phosphorylation of TAP-PIF1 in spaQ background compared to wild type in gels
containing 15 (top) and 25 (middle) µM phostag. (Bottom panel) The red light-induced slow-migrating band is a phosphorylated form of TAP-PIF1 as
indicated by the phosphatase treatment. +CIP, native Calf Intestinal Phosphatase; +B, heat-inactivated boiled CIP. c Overexpression of SPA1 induces faster
phosphorylation of PIF1-HA than wild type under weak red-light pulse (1 μmolm−2). Seedlings were pretreated with the proteasome inhibitor (40 μM
bortezomib) for 5 h before being exposed to red light. Blots were probed with anti-HA and anti-RPT5 antibodies. d Immunoblots showing native PIF1 level in
spaQ mutant compared to wild type. e Immunoblots show that TAP-SPA1 can interact with PIF1-HA in a red light-inducible manner in vivo

SPAs are necessary for light-induced PIF1 phosphorylation.
Since PIF1 is rapidly phosphorylated in response to light and
displays a characteristic mobility shift by immunoblot analy-
sis38,41, we used spaQ plants expressing pPIF1::TAP-PIF1 to
examine the in vivo effect of SPAs on the PIF1 phosphorylation.
Strikingly,
the rapid red light-induced phosphorylation and
consequent band shift of TAP-PIF1 observed in wild type plants
was completely abolished in the spaQ mutant (Fig. 2a). The PIF1
phosphorylation status was further examined by utilizing Phos-
tag containing SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2b). In wild type plants,
TAP-PIF1 showed clear mobility shift in the presence of 15 and
25 µM Phos-tag. However, in spaQ mutant, no mobility shift was
observed under these conditions (Fig. 2b, top and middle panel),
suggesting a complete absence of the light-induced phosphor-
ylation of PIF1 in vivo. As previously shown38, the TAP-PIF1

mobility shift was due to the light-induced phosphorylation of
PIF1, since treatment with the native calf intestinal phosphatase
(CIP) removed the shifted bands from TAP-PIF1 (Fig. 2b, bottom
panel). Overexpression of SPA1 in wild type plants resulted in a
faster and more robust phosphorylation of PIF1-HA under weak
red-light conditions (Fig. 2c), suggesting an in vivo role of SPA1
as a PIF1 kinase. Taken together, these loss-of-function and gain-
of-function analyses suggest that SPAs are essential for the light-
induced PIF1 phosphorylation in vivo.

Since the light-induced PIF1 phosphorylation was largely
absent in the spaQ mutant, we tested if the subsequent PIF1
degradation is also defective. As expected, the PIF1 degradation
was almost completely absent in the spaQ mutant compared to
wild type as previously shown (Fig. 2d). In addition, the light-
induced degradation of PIF1 was signiﬁcantly delayed in the

spa123 and spa124 triple mutants compared to wild type
(Supplementary Fig. 3a), indicating that SPAs are redundantly
functioning in light-mediated PIF1 degradation. In accordance
with a previous report41, the poly-ubiquitination of PIF1 in
response to light was largely reduced in the spaQ compared to
wild type (Supplementary Fig. 3b), conﬁrming a role of the
COP1-SPA complex in the light-induced ubiquitination of PIF1.
In addition, as previously shown, the in vivo interaction between
SPA1 and PIF1 is strongly induced under red light (Fig. 2e).
Because PIF1 is phosphorylated in response to red light, the red
light-induced PIF1-SPA1 interaction further supports that SPA1
might be recruited as a kinase for the light-induced PIF1
phosphorylation.

Since SPAs are usually present in complexes with COP1 in
planta18, and function together with COP121, we investigated
whether COP1 has any role
light-induced PIF1
phosphorylation. However, the light-induced PIF1 phosphoryla-
tion is not defective in the cop1-4 mutant (Supplementary Fig. 3c).
Since cop1-4 is a weak allele and still maintains some COP1
activity12, further experiments are necessary to exclude the role of
COP1 in PIF1 phosphorylation.

SPA1 kinase activity is crucial for seed germination. PIF1 has
been shown to be a master negative regulator of red light-
mediated seed germination35. As reported previously41, the spaQ
mutant exhibited signiﬁcantly delayed germination in response to
light possibly due to the increased stability of PIF1 (Fig. 3a). To
examine the biological signiﬁcance of the SPA1-mediated phos-
phorylation of PIF1, we expressed both the wild type and the

mutant form of SPA1 as a fusion protein with Luciferase (LUC) in
the spaQ background and selected homozygous transgenic plants
expressing either the wild type LUC-SPA1 or the LUC-mSPA1 in
the spaQ quadruple background (Supplementary Fig. 10c). Phe-
notypic analyses showed that the wild type LUC-SPA1 rescued the
seed germination phenotype to levels comparable to the wild type
(Fig. 3a). However, the kinase mutant LUC-mSPA1 failed to
complement the light-induced seed germination phenotype of the
spaQ, supporting a role of the SPA1 kinase activity in regulating
the light-induced seed germination through PIF1. At a molecular
level, LUC-mSPA1 plants showed a delayed phosphorylation and
subsequent degradation of PIF1 compared to the wild type LUC-
SPA1 in the spa1spa2spa3 triple background in vivo (Fig. 3b).
This is consistent with our biochemical data that mSPA1 has
reduced kinase activity; hence, reducing the phosphorylation of
PIF1 in vitro and in vivo. As previously reported43, the LUC-
mSPA1 also largely failed to rescue the constitutive photo-
morphogenic phenotypes of the spaQ in the dark compared to the
wild type LUC-SPA1 (Fig. 3c). These data suggest that the SPA1
kinase function is not only important for regulating seed germi-
nation, but also the skotomorphogenic development of Arabi-
dopsis seedlings.

SPA1 interacts with the C-terminus of phyB under red light.
The red/far-red photoreceptor phyB plays a major role in the red
light-mediated PIF1 phosphorylation and degradation in the
phyA background38. To investigate the functional relationship
between phyB and SPA1, we ﬁrst performed yeast two hybrid
assays to identify the domains necessary for their interaction. We

mapped the interaction domain between the coiled-coil (CC)
domain and WD-40 repeat (WD40) in the C-terminal half of
SPA1, and the C-terminal half of phyB (PHYB CT) using yeast-
two-hybrid assays (Fig. 4a). Further deletion analysis showed that
the last 80 amino acids of the C-terminal end of phyB is required
for the interaction with full-length SPA1 (Fig. 4a). Furthermore,
yeast two-hybrid growth assays using SPA1 and the two halves of

phyB showed that that the C-terminal half of phyB, but not the
N-terminal half of phyB (NG) interacts with SPA1 in a light-
independent manner, while NG interacted with PIF3 under these
conditions (Fig. 4b). Conversely, the extreme C-terminal (C)
domain of phyB was able to interact with SPA1 and the inter-
action level was comparable to the full-length C-terminal PHYB
(Fig. 4c). These data are consistent with a previous report46, and

Fig. 4 PhyB interacts with SPA1 in a light-dependent manner through its C-terminal domain. a Mapping of the interaction domains for phyB and SPA1 using
the Yeast-two-hybrid assays. Right panel shows the full-length and various domains of SPA1. Left, β-galactosidase assays show that the Coiled-Coil (CC)
domain and WD40 repeat at the C-terminus of SPA1 is necessary for interaction with the C-terminal domain of phyB (PHYB CT, aa 625-1172). On the
other hand, the extreme C-terminal 80 amino acids of PHYB-CT is necessary for SPA1 interaction. β-galactosidase activity was normalized by activation
domain (AD) empty vector control. LexA-PHYB CT (aa 625-1172), LexA-PHYB CT ΔC (aa 625-1092). Error bar = SD, (n = 2). b (Top panel) Yeast-two-
hybrid assays in the presence of chromophore phycocyanobillin (PCB). Yeast colonies were grown under red light for two days on –LTH (5 mM 3-AT)
drop-out media containing 20 µM of PCB. PIF3 was used as a positive control. The full-length phyB (D153-PHYB) can interact with PIF3 in both dark and
red light, while the N-terminal half of phyB (D153-PHYB NT) can only interact with PIF3 under red light. The C-terminal half of phyB also showed
interaction with PIF3 independent of light. However, under the same condition both full-length and N-terminal half of phyB failed to show interaction with
SPA1, whereas the C-terminal half of phyB showed interaction with SPA1. (Bottom panel) Growth on control plate is normal for all combinations of
constructs. c The C-terminal 80 amino acids of phyB are sufﬁcient for interaction with SPA1. (Top panel) Schematic diagram of various truncated
constructs of phyB fused to BD vector. Full-length SPA1 was fused to AD vector. Error bar = SD, (n = 2). d Schematic diagram showing the structures of
phyB-GFP FL and phyB-GFP ΔC as a fusion protein with green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP). e In vivo co immunoprecipitation assay shows that phyB interacts
with SPA1 in response to red light using the last 80 amino acids. phyB-SPA1 interaction is drastically reduced when the putative SPA1-interaction domain in
phyB C-terminus was deleted. f Semi-in vitro pull-down assay shows that the C-terminal domain of phyB is necessary for SPA1 interaction. g In vitro pull-
down assay with phyB-GFP puriﬁed from yeast and MBP-SPA1 expressed from E. coli shows light- and C-terminal-dependent interaction between the two
proteins. h Integrity of the puriﬁed phyB-GFP and phyB ΔC-GFP has been shown by in vitro light-dependent interaction with GST-PIF1

suggest that the putative SPA1 interaction domain at the very C-
terminal end of phyB is both necessary and sufﬁcient for SPA1
interaction in yeast. To conﬁrm this hypothesis by an indepen-
dent method, we cloned the full length PHYB (FL) and phyB ΔC
with a GFP tag in a binary vector (Fig. 4d). Stable transgenic
plants expressing similar levels of the full-length phyB-GFP FL or
phyB-GFP ΔC were generated in the phyA-211 phyB-9 back-
ground (Supplementary Fig. 10a). These lines were crossed with
the tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation (TAP) tagged SPA1 in phyAB
background (phyAB/TAP-SPA1), and the phyB-SPA1 interaction
was tested by a light-dependent in vivo co-immunoprecipitation
assay as previously described26. Interestingly, the phyB-GFP FL
robustly interacted with TAP-SPA1 in a red light-dependent
manner in vivo, whereas the phyB-GFP ΔC displayed much
reduced interaction with TAP-SPA1 (Fig. 4e). In addition, in a
semi-in vitro pull-down assay, we also observed strong interac-
tion between the phyB-GFP FL and MBP-SPA1. However, phyB-
GFP ΔC showed much reduced interaction with MBP-SPA1
(Fig. 4f). Because phyB can homo- and hetero-dimerize among
other type II phytochromes47, and these in vivo phyB-GFP FL
and phyB-GFP ΔC preparations might have both homo- and
hetero-dimers, we performed an in vitro pull-down assay using
phyB-GFP FL and phyB-GFP ΔC puriﬁed from yeast cells and
MBP-SPA1 from E. coli. The in vitro pull-down assay showed
that phyB-GFP ΔC failed to bind to MBP-SPA1, while phyB-GFP
FL strongly interacted with MBP-SPA1 in a light-dependent
manner (Fig. 4g). The integrity of the phyB-GFP FL and phyB-
GFP ΔC has been examined by the in vitro pull-down assay
where both proteins interacted with GST-PIF1 in a light-
dependent manner (Fig. 4h). These data collectively suggest
that the C-terminal 80 amino acids of phyB are indispensable for
the light-induced SPA1 interaction in Arabidopsis.

To rule out the possibility that SPA1 might still interact with
the N-terminal domain of phyB, we performed semi-in vivo co-
immunoprecipitation assays using the previously described PBG
(phyB-GFP FL), and NG (phyB N terminal-GFP-GUS-NLS)
transgenic plants48. Results show that PBG can interact with
MBP-SPA1 in a light-stimulated manner (Supplementary Fig. 4),
whereas NG failed to interact with MBP-SPA1 under these
conditions. Overall, these data suggest that SPA1 interacts with
phyB through the C-terminal domain.

phyB enhances
the phyB-SPA1-PIF1 complex formation
in vitro. To address the biochemical relevance of the phyB-SPA1
interaction, we performed an in vitro pull-down assay to test the
phyB-SPA1-PIF1 trimolecular complex formation. We expressed

GST-PIF1-strep protein in E. coli and examined its interaction
with SPA1 in the absence or presence of an increasing amount of
phyB. Pull-down using glutathione beads showed an interaction
between PIF1 and SPA1 in vitro even in the absence of phyB.
However, the PIF1-SPA1 interaction was strongly enhanced in
the presence of the Pfr form of phyB (Fig. 5a, b). Moreover, the
PIF1-SPA1 interaction was further enhanced when the phyB
amount was increased to two-fold. Thus, phyB-SPA1-PIF1 can
form a trimolecular complex in vitro.

Both SPA1 and phyB phosphorylate PIF1 in vitro. Phyto-
chromes displayed ser/thr kinase activity in vitro49,50. Although,
the C-terminal half of phytochromes have sequence similarity to
histidine kinase-related domains (HKRD), a recent study mapped
the kinase activity to the N-terminus of Oat phyA50. SPA1 shows
kinase activity in vitro, and both phyB and SPA1 are necessary for
PIF1 phosphorylation and degradation in vivo. Hence, we
examined the effect of phyB on the SPA1-mediated phosphor-
ylation of PIF1 in vitro. We performed a light-dependent in vitro
kinase assay to elucidate the molecular effect of phyB on the SPA1
kinase activity and vice versa. Figure 5c shows that both SPA1
and phyB independently phosphorylates PIF1 in vitro. Moreover,
PIF1 phosphorylation was strongly enhanced in the presence of
both SPA1 and phyB, possibly due to mutual enhancement of
PIF1 phosphorylation by each other. However, unlike the in vivo
data, no light-induced phosphorylation of PIF1 was observed
in vitro. Since the intrinsic kinase activity of Arabidopsis phyB is
still debatable, we established a method to purify functional
phytochromes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By using holo-
phytochromes, we repeated the in vitro kinase assay for both
phyA and phyB. In this assay, both phyA and phyB phos-
phorylated PIF1 in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The quality of
these phytochrome preparations has been examined by zinc blot
(Supplementary Fig. 5a), and in vitro interaction with GST-PIF1
in a light-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 5b). These data
support the hypothesis that phytochromes might function as
protein kinases for PIFs.

phyB-SPA1 interaction is necessary for PIF1 phosphorylation.
To elucidate the biological relevance underlying the phyB-SPA1
interaction, we examined PIF1 levels in both wild type PHYB-
GFP FL and PHYB-GFP ΔC transgenic plants. The light-induced
degradation of PIF1 is strongly reduced in the PHYB-GFP ΔC
lines compared to PHYB-GFP FL lines (Fig. 6a). In the PHYB-
GFP ΔC lines, even after 2 hours of red light exposure, the PIF1

Fig. 5 PhyB interaction with SPA1 promotes phyB-SPA1-PIF1 trimolecular complex formation and enhanced phosphorylation of PIF1 in vitro. a In vitro pull-
down assay shows that phyB enhances PIF1-SPA1 interaction in a light- and concentration-dependent manner. b Bar graph shows the enhanced interaction

level remained at ~60% of the dark level (Fig. 6a, b). However, the
PHYB-GFP FL lines showed complete PIF1 degradation in <30
min of red light, similar to wild type (Fig. 6a, b). We also
examined the phosphorylation status of PIF1 using Phos-tag and
regular SDS-PAGE gels. In these assays, TAP-PIF1 displayed no
band-shift in response to red light in the PHYB-GFP ΔC plants,
while the wild type PHYB-GFP FL induced a band-shift of TAP-
PIF1 under these conditions (Fig. 6c, d), indicating an absence of
phosphorylation in the PHYB-GFP ΔC transgenic plants. These
data strongly suggest that the phyB-SPA1 interaction is essential
for phyB to recruit SPA1 into a phyB-SPA1-PIF1 trimolecular
complex and facilitate PIF1 phosphorylation and degradation in
response to light.

phyB C-terminal domain is essential for photobody formation.
phyB has been shown to form nuclear photobodies in response to
red light, and the size and number of photobodies have been
implicated to phyB function24,51,52. To examine whether the C-
terminal domain of phyB is necessary for the photobody for-
mation, we grew PHYB-GFP FL and PHYB-GFP ΔC transgenic
seedlings in the dark and then exposed them to red light for
various time periods. phyB-GFP FL seedlings displayed normal
nuclear photobodies as previously described51. However, phyB-
GFP ΔC transgenic seedlings failed to form nuclear photobodies
even after prolonged light exposure (Fig. 6e, Supplementary
Fig. 6). To examine if the C-terminal domain is necessary for
phyB nuclear transport, we measured the cytosolic GFP signal in
the hypocotyl cells of both PHYB-GFP FL and PHYB-GFP ΔC
transgenic seedlings. Results show that the GFP signal is much
more abundant in the cytoplasm of PHYB-GFP ΔC compared to
PHYB-GFP FL seedlings (Fig. 6f). These data are consistent with a
previous report that phyB-NG-NLS which lacks the C-terminal
half of phyB failed to form nuclear photobodies under red light.
In contrast, the C-terminal domain of phyB is sufﬁcient to form
nuclear bodies even in darkness48. Thus, these results suggest that
the interaction between phyB and SPA1 and possibly other

proteins including other SPAs through the C-terminal domain
might be necessary for robust phyB nuclear transport and pho-
tobody formation in response to light.

phyB C-terminus is necessary for multiple phytochrome
responses. To examine the biological signiﬁcance of phyB-SPA1
interaction, we examined a variety of phenotypes of PHYB-GFP
FL and PHY-GFP ΔC transgenic plants compared to wild type
(Fig. 7a). Because of PIF1’s exclusive role in light-regulated ger-
mination, we ﬁrst examined the seed germination phenotypes of
these genotypes. As shown in Fig. 7b, PHYB-GFP ΔC seeds
showed signiﬁcantly delayed germination compared to PHYB-
GFP FL, which is similar to spaQ seeds (Fig. 3a), again supporting
the role of the SPA1-interaction domain of phyB in regulating
seed germination in response to red light. Previous genetic
screens have described the isolation of multiple phyB hypo-
sensitive mutants53. Among them, phyB-28 mutant has a pre-
mature stop codon resulting in the production of phyB with
similar deletion (1-991) to phyB-GFP ΔC (1-1092) (Fig. 7a)54. To
examine whether phyB-28 shows similar germination defects as
observed in PHYB-GFP ΔC, we generated transgenic plants
expressing PHYB-28 in the phyA-211phyB-9 background similar
to a wild type phyA-211 level (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Com-
pared to wild type (phyA-211), phyB-28 showed a signiﬁcant delay
in germination rate in response to red light (Fig. 7c), suggesting
that the hyposensitive phenotypes of the phyB-28 allele might be
due to a defect in the interaction with SPA proteins. Consistent
with the above genetic analyses, the light-induced phosphoryla-
tion and degradation of PIF1 is also defective in phyB-28 allele
compared to phyA211 control (Fig. 7d).

In addition to seed germination, other phytochrome-mediated
responses are also signiﬁcantly reduced in the phyB-GFP ΔC and
phyB-28 mutants compared to wild type phyB-GFP FL. Hypocotyl
lengths under different ﬂuences of red light were measured for
phyB-GFP FL and phyB-GFP ΔC as well as phyB-28 expressing
plants. Results show that the hypocotyl lengths of phyB-GFP ΔC

and phyB-28 are signiﬁcantly longer compared to controls under
various ﬂuences of red light (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b, c).
Measurement of the petiole lengths using 3-week-old plants show
that phyB-GFP ΔC has
signiﬁcantly longer petiole lengths
compared to those of phyB-GFP FL (Supplementary Fig. 7d),
suggesting a role of the phyB C-terminus in multiple phyto-
chrome responses. Consistent with our results, the previously
reported NG and CG seedlings showed more stable PIF1 under
red light than PBG (Supplementary Fig. 7e); although, both NG
and CG induced a slight degradation of PIF1 compared to
phyAphyB. Recently, CG has been shown to induce degradation of
PIFs55. Because NG undergoes rapid degradation compared to
PBG56, and NG and the isolated N-terminal photosensory
domain can interact with PIFs57,58,
is possible that NG
undergoes co-degradation with PIF1 through PPK kinases or
additional unknown kinases59. Taken together, by analyzing
the
multiple phyB mutants,

Several lines of evidence show that the C-terminal end of phyB
is speciﬁcally necessary for SPA1 interaction and PIF1 degrada-
tion, as opposed to a defect in interaction with PIF1 and/or lack
of dimerization. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 8a, PIF1
interacts with both phyB-GFP FL and phyB-GFP ΔC with a
similar strength in vivo. Second, an in vitro native PAGE gel
shows that phyB-GFP ΔC can dimerize in a similar manner to the
phyB-GFP FL protein (Supplementary Fig. 8b). However, the
isolated phyB CT ΔC failed to dimerize in yeast assays, despite
similar dimerization activity of the phyB CT ΔC with phyB CT in
yeast two-hybrid assays (Supplementary Fig. 8c), suggesting that
the dimerization might be defective in the isolated phyB CT ΔC,
in the phyB-GFP ΔC context. Third, chromatin

Fig. 7 Direct interaction between phyB and SPA1 is necessary for phyB-mediated seed germination. a Schematic diagram of phyB-28, phyB-GFP ΔC and
phyB-GFP FL proteins. b, c The C-terminal SPA1-interaction domain of phyB is necessary for phyB-mediated seed germination. phyB-GFP ΔC displays
reduced germination compared to phyB-GFP FL lines, while phyB-28 displays slower germination compared to wild type (phyA-211 that contains wild type
PHYB). The error bars indicate s.e.m. (n = 3). d The light-induced phosphorylation and degradation of TAP-PIF1 is defective in phyB-28 compared to wild
type (phyA-211 that contains wild type PHYB). Total protein was extracted from four-day-old dark-grown seedlings either kept in darkness or exposed to
continuous red light (3.5 μmolm−2 s−1) over time

as well as phyB-GFP ΔC equally sequester PIF1 from the G-box
on the PIL1 promoter in response to red light (Supplementary
Fig. 8d). Fourth, we introduced mutations in the four conserved
amino acids in the HKRD domain to test whether the possible
HKRD-related activity was affected in phyB-GFP ΔC (Supple-
mentary Fig. 8e), and made homozygous transgenic plants
expressing the wild type phyB-GFP FL and phyB-GFP 4 M in
the phyA211-phyB-9 background. Immunoblots show that the red
light-induced PIF1 degradation was not affected in the phyB-GFP
4 M compared to phyB-GFP FL (Supplementary Fig. 8f), suggest-
ing that the residues within the HKRD-related domain are not
necessary for PIF1 degradation. Finally, we puriﬁed phyB-GFP
FL, phyB-GFP ΔC, and phyB-GFP 4 M proteins from Sacchar-
omyces cerevisiae and conﬁrmed no change in the intrinsic phyB
kinase activities in these mutants (Supplementary Fig. 8g).
Because phyB-GFP ΔC failed to form nuclear photobodies under
red light and also defective in SPA1 interaction, the light-induced
degradation of PIF1 might be promoted by either phyB-SPA1
interaction and/or phyB photobody formation in Arabidopsis.

SPAs are necessary for PIF-target gene regulation. To under-
stand the molecular basis of SPA- and phyB-mediated regulation
of PIF1 stability, we also performed RNA-seq analysis for spaQ,
cop1-4 and Col-0 using 3-day-old dark-grown seedlings and dark-
grown seedlings exposed to red light for 1 h. In wild type Col-0,
2702 genes are differentially expressed between dark and 1 h of
red light treated samples (Fig. 8a), which are categorized as red
light responsive genes in the wild type. Red light responsive genes
between 1 h of red light treatment compared to dark in cop1-4

and spaQ are also presented in Supplemental Data 1. In spaQ and
cop1-4 mutants, however, 1861 genes are no longer responding to
the red-light treatment, suggesting the importance of COP1-SPA
complex in regulating red light-responsive gene expression
(Supplemental Data 2). Remarkably, the spaQ mutant showed
854 genes that do not overlap with cop1-4 differentially expressed
genes (Fig. 8a, Supplemental Data 3). The existence of these
exclusively SPA-dependent genes supports a COP1-independent
function of SPA proteins.

We also performed RNA-seq analysis for phyB-GFP FL and
phyB-GFP ΔC under the same conditions. A total of 1117 genes
were differentially expressed in phyB-GFP FL in response to red
light within 1 h (Fig. 8b, Supplemental Data 1, 4). Among them,
561 genes were misregulated in phyB-GFP ΔC mutant that did not
display light responsiveness (Supplemental Data 5). Thus, we
categorized these genes into phyB C-terminal-dependent red-
responsive genes (Fig. 8b). By comparing the differential gene
expression in Col-0 Red/Dark and spaQ Red/Dark (Fig. 8a), 2199
genes no longer responding to red light treatment in spaQ and are
deﬁned as SPA-dependent red responsive genes. Because we
identiﬁed the phyB C-terminus as a SPA1 interaction domain
(Fig. 4), we compared the list of phyB C-terminal-dependent red-
responsive genes with the SPA-dependent red-responsive genes.
These analyses showed that ~59% (333/561) of
the phyB
C-terminal-dependent genes also overlap with SPA-dependent
genes (Fig. 8c, Supplemental Data 6), suggesting a common
regulatory pathway shared by phyB and SPA proteins. Red light
responsive spaQ-regulated genes were identiﬁed as differentially
expressed genes between spaQ in red light compared to Col-0 in

found ~54% (1086/2025) of
the PIF-mis-regulated genes in
darkness overlapped with the spaQ-regulated genes in response to
red light (Fig. 8d, Supplemental Data 7). We generated a heatmap
for these 1086 overlapping genes and compared their gene
expression changes in two different genotypes (pifQ vs spaQ). A
large number of genes showed a similar pattern of up (red)- or
down (green)-regulation compared to wild type (Fig. 8e),
suggesting that SPA-regulated genes in early red light are largely
PIF-regulated as well. Among these genes, Fig. 8f shows an
example of the expression level for one light-inducible and one

among phyB-SPA-PIF1 in regulating gene expression and

Discussion
Substrate recognition by E3 ubiquitin ligases and subsequent
degradation is one of the most critical cellular processes that is
regulated by multiple signaling cascades in plants and animals2,61.
Speciﬁc recognition of a substrate by an E3 ubiquitin ligase can be
enhanced by phosphorylation of a substrate which increases the
afﬁnity between the substrate and the E3 ligase1,62. To promote
photomorphogenesis, PIFs are phosphorylated, ubiquitinated and
then degraded under light31,32. This study provides a mechanistic
view on how PIF1 is phosphorylated and ubiquitinated by a

cognate kinase-E3 ubiquitin ligase (COP1-SPA) for rapid light-
induced degradation.

Although, initial studies on the SPA proteins were focused on
their accessory role in enhancing COP1 E3 ligase function, a
COP1-independent role for SPAs has not been shown yet, despite
the presence of a kinase-like domain at the N-terminus. Here we
show that the N-terminal domain of SPA1 possesses a ser/thr
kinase activity. Recombinant full-length SPA1 and the N-terminal
kinase-like
catalytic domain (SPA1-Kin) display autopho-
sphorylation activity (Fig. 1). Both proteins also phosphorylate a
generic substrate MBP and a native plant substrate PIF1 in a
concentration-dependent manner in vitro. The SPA1-mediated
phosphorylation is acid stable and base labile, suggesting that the
phosphorylated residues are serine and/or threonine (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2c). Mutation in a critical residue of SPA1 (R517E)
abrogating a conserved Glu-Arg salt bridge essential for eukar-
yotic protein kinases results in reduced kinase activity toward
MBP and PIF1 in vitro (Fig. 1). The wild type and mutant SPA1-
Kin domains equally bound to an ATP analog (TNP-ATP) in a
concentration-dependent manner
in vitro (Supplementary
Fig. 2e), suggesting that the mutant SPA1-Kin is not defective in
ATP binding. Consistently, the light-induced phosphorylation of
PIF1 is reduced in the mutant SPA1 compared to wild type SPA1
transgenic plants (Fig. 3c). Moreover, the light-induced phos-
phorylation of PIF1 is drastically reduced in spaQ compared to
wild type (Fig. 2). In addition, the mutant SPA1 failed to rescue
the seedling de-etiolation phenotype in the dark and the light-
induced seed germination phenotype compared to wild type
SPA1 transgenic plants (Fig. 3a, b). Taken together, these data
strongly support the conclusion that SPA1 acts as a bona ﬁde ser/
thr kinase for PIF1.

information critical

Recently, it was shown that SPA1R517E mutant failed to rescue
the seedling deetiolation phenotype of spaQ43, and these authors
hypothesized that the kinase domain of SPA1 may provide
structural
for SPA1 function. We have
reproduced these data independently and also show additional
phenotypes defective in this mutant. Our data show that the
kinase domain displays a protein kinase activity in phosphor-
ylating PIF1 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the kinase like
domain of SPA1 may act as a molecular scaffold for potential
protein-protein interaction. The arginine 517 in SPA1 is very well
conserved among many plant species, suggesting an importance
of the structural integrity of the kinase domain (Supplementary
Fig. 1). It is possible that the SPA1R517E mutant compromised not
only the kinase activity, but also the structural integrity of the
SPA1 kinase domain, resulting in a defect in PIF1 degradation
and seed germination in response to light. The biochemical basis
for the failure of the SPA1R517E mutant to rescue the spaQ
seedling de-etiolation phenotype in the dark is still unknown.
However, our hypothesis is that the kinase activity by itself and/or
the structural information included within the kinase domain
contribute to regulating seedling de-etiolation phenotypes.

Direct interaction of PIF1 with the Pfr form of phyB is
necessary for
the rapid light-induced phosphorylation and
degradation of PIF138. The in vitro and in vivo data presented
here show that phyB is promoting the PIF1-SPA1-phyB complex
formation in a red light-inducible manner. Domain mapping
analyses shows the last 80 amino acids at the C-terminal end of
phyB is necessary and sufﬁcient for SPA1 interaction (Fig. 4a–e).
Deletion of the SPA1 binding domain from phyB (phyB ΔC)
results in reduced PIF1 phosphorylation and degradation and
hyposensitive phenotypes of phyB-GFP ΔC compared to wild type
phyB-GFP FL plants (Figs. 6, 7, Supplementary Fig. 7). In addi-
tion, three other phyB C-terminal deletion mutants, phyB-28, CG
that were previously reported48,54, also showed
and NG,
reduced phosphorylation and degradation of PIF1 similar to that

of phyB-GFP ΔC (Fig. 7, Supplementary Fig. 7), further sup-
porting that the C-terminal end of phyB is required for phyB-
SPA1 interaction. Overall, these data strongly suggest that the
recruitment of SPA1 kinase in a PIF1-SPA1-phyB trimolecular
complex is a critical step for the rapid light-induced phosphor-
ylation of PIF1.

The importance of the C-terminal domain of phytochromes in
mediating light signaling has been in focus for decades63.
Recently, Qiu et al showed that overexpression of the C-terminal
domain of phyB (625 -1172 aa) induces degradation of PIF3 and
activates light-inducible gene expression in the dark55. Consistent
with this study, Park et al (2018) showed that phyB regulates PIF
activity by two independent methods: PIF sequestration, which is
induced by the N-terminal half of phyB57,64, and PIF degradation,
which is induced by the C-terminal half of phyB64. These two
separable activities of phyB are located in two halves of phyB
protein. Although, these data highlight the importance of the C-
terminal domain of phyB in regulation of PIF abundance, our
data show that the last 80 amino acids of the C-terminal domain
of phyB is necessary for the light-dependent SPA1 interaction
both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, this domain is necessary for
phyB nuclear translocation and photobody formation in response
to light (Fig. 6e). SPA proteins co-translocate with phyB into the
nucleus46. However, it is highly unlikely that SPA proteins are the
only factors facilitating transport of phyB into nucleus, as PIFs
also promote nuclear translocation of phyB65. It is possible that
this domain interacts with SPA proteins as well as other factors,
and these combined interactions are required for phyB nuclear
transport and photobody formation. Because phyB-GFP ΔC
behaves normally in terms of chromophore binding, dimeriza-
tion, PIF1 interaction and sequestration, and complements the
phyB phenotypes to a large extent, the defects observed in phyB-
GFP ΔC seedlings might not be due to a non-functional protein,
rather due in part to a lack of phyB-SPA1 binding in addition to
other potential unknown interactions necessary for robust phyB
nuclear transport and photobody formation. However, it is still
possible that phyB-ΔC might have additional intrinsic defects that
were not fully addressed in our study. For example, the phyB-
GFP ΔC exhibits defect in the photobody formation similar to the
PBY18-YFP (D1040V), which cannot dimerize55. But unlike
PBY18-YFP (D1040V) which lacks PIF3 interaction, phyB-GFP
ΔC still interacts with PIF1 in vivo. Because the isolated phyB CT
ΔC failed to dimerize in yeast, it is still possible that the last 80
amino acids of phyB contributes to the dimerization and pho-
tobody formation of phyB-GFP ΔC.

Multiple kinases phosphorylate PIFs in vitro including, phy-
tochrome itself32,42,49,50,59,66. However, Casein Kinase II (CK2)
and BRASSINOSTEROID- INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2) were shown
to phosphorylate PIF1 and PIF4, respectively, only in vitro in a
light-independent manner. Photoregulatory Protein Kinases
(PPK1–PPK4) phosphorylate PIF3 both in vitro and in vivo, and
the light-induced phosphorylation of PIF3 is defective in ppk
mutants compared to wild type59. However, PPKs do not interact
with phyB in a light-dependent manner in vitro. Moreover, PPK-
mediated phosphorylation of PIF3 might be involved in signal
attenuation as opposed to signal transduction, as the ppk mutants
display hypersensitive phenotypes in response to red light. A
recent study also showed that phytochrome itself acts as a kinase
for PIFs50. However, the kinase activity of oat phyA has been
mapped to the N-terminus as opposed to a conserved HKRD
located at the C-terminus. Although the location of the kinase
domain in Arabidopsis phys is still being investigated, puriﬁed
Arabidopsis phyA and phyB from two different expression hosts
induce phosphorylation of PIF1 in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Moreover, phyB and SPA1 mutually enhanced phosphorylation
of PIF1 in vitro (Fig. 5). Thus, it appears that multiple kinases are

Fig. 9 Model showing phyB-SPA1-COP1-PIF1 relationships in dark and light conditions. In darkness, inactive Pr form of phyB is present in the cytoplasm,
while COP1-SPA complex together with PIF1 as a co-factor induces degradation of positively acting transcription factors (HY5/HFR1 and possibly others).
However, upon light exposure, activated Pfr form of phyB translocates into the nucleus and interacts with PIF1 as well as SPA1 to trigger rapid
phosphorylation of PIF1. phyB interacts with PIFs mostly through its N-terminal domain, while its extreme C-terminal 80 amino acids (shown as a red
patch) are necessary for SPA1 interaction. By stabilizing the phyB-SPA1-PIF1 tripartite complex, phyB can initiate the light-induced phosphorylation of PIF1
by SPA1 kinase. Phosphorylated PIF1 is then recognized by the CUL4COP1-SPA E3 ubiquitin ligase for rapid poly-ubiquitination and subsequent degradation
through the 26S proteasome. Degradation of PIFs and stabilization of HY5 result in promotion of photomorphogenesis

necessary for sequential and possibly cooperative phosphoryla-
tion of PIF1. Phenotypic analyses showed that only spaQ exhibits
robustly delayed germination phenotype and an absence of the
light-induced PIF1 phosphorylation in vivo. Therefore, SPAs are
necessary for phyB-mediated signal transduction to regulate PIF1
abundance (Fig. 9).

Because SPAs are crucial for the COP1-SPA E3 ubiquitin ligase
complex, this study identiﬁed a novel mechanism by which a
cognate kinase-E3 ligase complex selectively interacts with its
substrate and triggers rapid degradation in a light-inducible
manner. This unique kinase-E3 ligase complex may account for
the rapid degradation speed observed under red light for PIF138.
Finally, our ﬁndings suggest that other known COP1-SPA targets
might also be phosphorylated by SPAs, given that the WD40
repeat domains present in COP1 and SPA proteins prefer phos-
phorylated substrates for binding67,68. Future experiments are
necessary to address whether other COP1-SPA substrates are also
phosphorylated by SPA kinase, and if the cognate kinase-E3
ubiquitin ligase model presented here may also be applicable to
other E3 ligase complexes in plants and animals.

Methods
Plant materials and growth conditions. Wild type Col-0, various mutants, and
transgenic plants in the Col-0 background were used in this study unless otherwise
indicated. Plants were grown in soil under 24-h light at 22 ± 0.5 °C.

Construction of vectors and generation of transgenic plants. TAP-PIF1, TAP-
SPA1, PIF1-HA, TAP-SPA1/PIF1-HA, and TAP-PIF1/spaQ transgenic plants were
reported previously13,22,38,41,42. To generate phyB-GFP FL and phyB-GFP ΔC,
PHYB F KpnI-PHYB R SmaI, PHYB-GFP ΔC R SmaI primers were used to
amplify PHYB coding sequence. These were ﬁrst subcloned into pEZS-NL vector.
The expression cassettes from pEZS-NL-PHYB(ΔC) were cut out with NotI and
cloned into pART27 binary vector with NotI restriction enzyme. Then pART27-
PHYB(ΔC)-GFP were transformed into phyA-211phyB-9 double mutant and
transformants were selected in the presence of Kanamycin antibiotics. For SPA1,
full-length SPA1-6his coding sequence was ampliﬁed by PCR using the primers
SPA1 F BamHI -His R XhoI and cloned into pCAMBIA C-luc vector. The mutant
version of SPA1, mSPA1 was generated using Quickchage II site-directed muta-
genesis kit (Agilent, Catalog #200523) in pBSK-SPA1. Both wild type and the
mutant SPA1 were transformed into GV3101 and then transformed into spa123
mutant. Obtained SPA1 transgenic plants in spa123 were further crossed with spaQ
mutant to generate SPA1/spaQ and mSPA1/spaQ transgenic plants.

Protein puriﬁcation from E. coli. SPA1 kinase domain was subcloned into
pASK75 vector with SPA1 F BamHI- SPA1 kin R SalI primers. SPA1 kinase
domain was then PCR ampliﬁed with SPA1 F BamHI-Strep R NotI primers and

cloned into pGEX4T-1. For generation of mSPA1, pASK75-SPA1 kinase domain
clone was mutagenized using Quickchange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agi-
lent, Catalog #200523). Each plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells.
Protein expression was induced under 16 °C for 12 h with 0.1 mM IPTG. Collected
cells were sonicated in binding buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2%
Tergitol NP-40, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1· Protease inhibitor cocktail, and 1 mM PMSF)
and puriﬁed using Strep-Tactin Sepharose column (IBA, Cat# 2-1209-001). Col-
umns were washed three times thoroughly by applying 5 mL of the binding buffer.
Proteins were eluted with the elution buffer (Tris 7.5 100 mM, EDTA 1 mM, 10%
glycerol, 10 mM d-desthiobiotin) into separate fractions. The eluted proteins were
analyzed on a SDS-PAGE gel and used for kinase assays. pGEX PIF1-strep clone
was previously reported50. GST-PIF1-strep was puriﬁed using the same method as
described in this section. For MBP-SPA1, pMAL p2x SPA1 construct was used as
described previously41.

SPA1 and phytochrome puriﬁcation from Pichia pastoris. The full-length SPA1
coding sequence was PCR-ampliﬁed with SPA1 F BamHI-SPA1 R SalI primers and
subcloned into pASK75 vector. Then, SPA1-strep coding sequence was PCR-
ampliﬁed with SPA1 F SnaBI- strep R NotI primers and cloned into pPIC3.5 K
vector. Flag sequences (3·) were further cloned into the SnaBI site of the pPIC3.5 K
SPA1-strep clone using Flag F-Flag R primers. Approximately 30 µg of SPA1-strep
pPIC3.5 K plasmid DNA was linearized using PmeI restriction enzyme. Pichia
pastoris strain GS115 was grown in YPD media and the electro-competent cell was
prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technology, Pichia
Expression Kit, Cat.# K1710-01). Electroporation was performed using a general
setup provided by electroporator (Bio-rad) for Pichia pastoris. Transformed colo-
nies were selected on the MD media plates (1· YNB, 1· biotin, 2% Dextrose, 1.8%
agar). Plates were incubated at 30 °C for two days to obtain ~5000 colonies.
Multiple genomic integrations of the plasmids were further conﬁrmed by antibiotic
resistance at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4 µM of G418 Geneticin (Sigma, Cat.#
11811023) containing YPD media for ﬁve days of incubation. The selected colonies
were tested their Muts phenotype on solid MM media (1· YNB, 1· biotin, 5%
methanol, 1.8% agar) and used for protein puriﬁcation. For induction of the
protein expression, the colony was initially inoculated in 10 mL of liquid MM
media for 24 h, and then cultured in 200 mL of liquid MGY (1x YNB, 1x biotin, 2%
glycerol) media for an additional 24 h. The cells were collected and MGY media
was completely removed. Then, the collected cells were resuspended and diluted
into 1 L of liquid MM media (1x YNB, 1x biotin, 5% methanol) to induce protein
expression for 24 h at 30 °C.

The collected induced cells were resuspended in the lysis buffer (100 mM Tris
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Tergitol NP-40, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1x Protease inhibitor
cocktail, 1 mM PMSF) and ground in liquid nitrogen using physical force with a
homogenizer (Nohonseiki Kaisha LTD Japan, model AM-3). The whole cell
extracts were ﬁltered through a 0.45 µm ﬁlter and ran through the Strep-Tactin
Sepharose column (IBA Lifesciences, Cat.# 2-1202-001) for puriﬁcation. The
column was washed 5 times thoroughly before eluting with the elution buffer
(100 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mM d-desthiobiotin).
Puriﬁed protein was analyzed on a SDS-PAGE gel.

Arabidopsis phytochrome B was puriﬁed from Pichia pastoris as described
previously69. In brief, PHYB expressing Pichia pastoris GS115 strain was grown in
200 mL MGY media for 24 h before transferring into 1 L MM media to induce
protein expression. The cells were harvested and homogenized. Total proteins were

precipitated by ammonium sulfate salting-out (0.23 g/mL) methods. The pellet was
resuspended and assembled with a chromophore (10 µM), phycocyanobilin
(Frontier Scientiﬁc, Cat.# P14137). Strep-Tactin Sepharose column was used to
purify phyB holoprotein. The puriﬁed protein was analyzed on a SDS-PAGE gel.

Phytochrome puriﬁcation from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We obtained Sac-
charomyces strain RKY1293 from Dr. Arlen Johnson at UT. The full-length PHYB
coding sequence was ﬁrst subcloned into pEZS-NL using phyB F KpnI- phyB R
SmaI primers. By using phyB F KpnI- GFP R XbaI primers, PHYB-GFP was PCR-
ampliﬁed and cloned into pYES2 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) vector. The pYES2-
PHYB-GFP was transformed into yeast strain RKY1293 using EZ transformation
kit and transformants were selected on –URA dropout media. The selected colonies
were grown in the 50 mL of liquid –URA dropout media with 2% rafﬁnose as a
carbon source. By adding 2% of galactose, phyB expression was induced for 12 h.
The induced cells were collected and resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mM Tris pH
7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tergitol NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 1x Protease inhibitor
cocktail, 1 mM PMSF), and then frozen in liquid nitrogen to be ground thoroughly
using a pestle and mortar. The ﬁne powder was thawed on the mortar and collected
in the test tubes. Tubes were centrifuged at a maximum speed 20200 × g for 20 min
at 4 °C. For puriﬁcation of the apoprotein, one microgram of anti-GFP (Abcam #
ab6556) antibody was preincubated with 20 µL of protein A Dynabeads for 15 min.
The antibody-bound Dynabeads were washed with the lysis buffer and incubated
with the supernatant. After two hours of incubation, the Dynabeads were collected
and washed three times with the lysis buffer using a magnet rack. The immuno-
precipitated PHYB containing Dynabeads were resuspended in 100 µL of the lysis
buffer supplemented with 10 ⌠M phycocyanobilin (PCB) and incubated in the dark
for 1 h. The Dynabeads were collected and washed four times thoroughly with the
lysis buffer and used for other assays.

In vitro kinase assay. For SPA1 kinase assay, about 500 ng of SPA1 and 1 µg of
GST-PIF1 were used. For Pichia puriﬁed phyB, about 1 µg of holoprotein was used
for the kinase assay. For Saccharomyces puriﬁed phyA and phyB, about 500 ng of
holoproteins were used. All kinase assays were performed in kinase buffer (50 mM
Tris, pH 7.5, 4 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2) except the
phyB + SPA1 light dependent kinase assay, which contains 100 mM NaCl. 32P
radio-labeled gamma-ATP (Perkin Elmer Cat# BLU502A) was added to the
reaction and incubated at 28 °C for 1 h unless otherwise indicated. SDS sample
buffer (6x) was added to stop the reaction and the boiled proteins were separated
on a SDS-PAGE gel. The gels were dried and exposed to a phosphor screen and
then scanned with Typhoon FLA 9500 (GE healthcare, Chicago, USA).

Acid and base sensitivity assay. The kinase assay was performed as described in
the previous section. The total reaction containing SPA1 and PIF1 was boiled and
divided into three lanes in a SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were blotted onto PVDF
membrane and cut into three pieces. Each piece was treated with neutral (Tris, pH
7.5), basic (3 M KOH) and acid (1 M HCl) solution as described previously49. The
membrane was then exposed to a phosphor screen and scanned by Typhoon FLA

PIF1 mobility shift assay. To observe TAP-PIF1 mobility shift in Col-0 and spaQ,
total protein was separated in a 10·10.5 cm 6.5% SDS-PAGE. For phostag gel
analysis, each sample was ground in the buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween20, 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma-
Aldrich, Cat# P9599], 1 mM PMSF, 20 μM bortezomib, 25 mM β-glyceropho-
sphate, 10 mM NaF, and 2 mM Na orthovanadate) and immunoprecipitated using
anti-myc (Sigma, Cat.# C3956) antibody. The immunoprecipitated TAP-PIF1 was
then separated on a 6.5% SDS-PAGE gel containing 15-30 µM phostag acrylamide
(Wako Japan, Cat# AAL-107). The phostag gel was prepared according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Yeast two-hybrid Yeast two-hybrid assay. LexA-phyB CT indicates the C-
terminal domain of PHYB (aa 625-1172) and LexA-phyB CT ΔC indicates the C-
terminal half of PHYB without the last 80 amino acids (aa 625-1092). For the bait
proteins, phyB CT and phyB CT ΔC PCR products were ampliﬁed using PHYB-F-
BamHI/PHYB-R-SalI and PHYB-F-BamHI /PHYB CT ΔC-R-SalI primers,
respectively. PCR products were then cloned into pEG202 vector with LexA fusion.
For the prey proteins, the full-length and various deletion fragments of AD-SPA1
fusion constructs were described previously41. All the constructed were conﬁrmed
by enzyme digestion and sequencing.

Plasmids containing bait and prey constructs were transformed into EGY48
yeast strain and selected on -His, -Ura, -Trp dropout medium at 30 °C for 3 days.
Yeast colonies grown on this minimal medium were cultured overnight in liquid
media supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose. Overnight cultures (1 mL) were then
transferred to 4 mL liquid medium supplemented with 2% (w/v) galactose and 1%
(w/v) rafﬁnose to induce the expression of proteins. β-galactosidase assays were
performed according to the Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System, (Takara
Biosciences). Three independent replicates were performed and the bar graphs
represent the β-galactosidase activity normalized by activation domain (AD) vector
control.

The light-dependent Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed as described26.
The AD-PIF3, AD-SPA1, and D153-phyB NT-BD constructs have been described
previously41,70. Brieﬂy, AD and BD fusion combination plasmids were transformed
into AH109 yeast cells and selected on drop out media without Leu and Trp.
Individual colonies were cultured in the same liquid media and 10 μL of each
culture were spotted on a plate containing 5 mM 3-AT and 20 μM phycocyanobilin
(PCB), but lacking Leu, Trp and His. Colonies were grown at 30 °C for 2 days and
then photographed. A control plate without Leu and Trp was grown to show
normal growth.

In vivo co-immunoprecipitation assay. For in vivo co-immunoprecipitation
assays, ~400 4-day-old dark-grown seedlings were collected and ground in liquid
nitrogen. Total proteins were solubilized in the IP buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.25 mM DTT, 1 × protease
inhibitor cocktail [Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, Cat# P9599], 1 mM PMSF,
20 μM bortezomib, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM NaF, and 2 mM Na
orthovanadate), cleared by centrifugation at 20200 xg for 10 mins. Anti-HA
(Abcam, Cat.# ab9110), and anti-GFP (Abcam, Cat.# ab6556) were bound to
dynabeads before adding into total cell extractions. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C
in the dark, the dynabeads (20 μl/μg antibody; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA)
were collected and washed using IP buffer on magnet rack. The beads were then
boiled with 6X SDS sample buffer, ran on a 6.5% SDS-PAGE gel, and blotted with
corresponding antibodies.

In vitro/semi-in vitro pull-down assay. For in vitro pull-down assay, GST-PIF1,
GST, SPA1-strep, and mSPA1-strep proteins were puriﬁed as described above.
Total 2 µg of GST and GST PIF1 proteins were bound to 25 µl of GST agarose
beads (Pierce, Waltham, USA. Cat.# 20211). One microgram of SPA1 and mSPA1
was added to each sample with 500 µL binding buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Tergitol NP-40, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 × protease
inhibitor cocktail, 1 mM PMSF). After 2 h of incubation with gentle rotation at 4 °
C, beads were collected with centrifugation at 1800 × g. The collected beads were
thoroughly washed ﬁve (x 5 mins) with 1 ml of the binding buffer by gentle
rotation. Beads were then boiled with 2x SDS sample buffer and separated on an
SDS-PAGE gel to visualize protein with Coomassie staining.

For semi-in vitro immunoprecipitation assay, phyB-GFP FL and phyB-GFP ΔC
seeds were grown in the dark for 4 days before grinding in liquid nitrogen. Total
protein was solubilized in IP buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 0.1% Tween20, 0.25 mM DTT, 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma-
Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, Cat# P9599], 1 mM PMSF). The extracts were cleared
by centrifugation at 20200 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with
anti-GFP (Abcam, Cat.# ab6556) antibody-bound dynabeads (20 μL/μg antibody)
for one hour in the dark. Immunoprecipitated phyB-GFP proteins were washed
three times with IP buffer. Whole cell extract from IPTG induced E. coli harboring
pMal p2x SPA1 plasmids were added into immunoprecipitated beads and each
tube was treated either red (10 µmolm−2 s−1) or far-red light (15 µmole/s/m2) for
5 mins. After an additional two hours incubation at 4 °C, beads were washed four
times, ﬁve mins each with extraction buffer (100 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.8, 150
mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2% Nondidet P-40, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail, 1 mM
PMSF). Beads were then boiled with 2X SDS sample buffer and separated on a
SDS-PAGE gel. Anti-MBP (NEB, Cat.# E8032S) antibody was used to detect co-
immunoprecipitated SPA1-MBP protein.

For the tripartite complex pull-down assay, 2 µg of puriﬁed GST-PIF1-strep

were bound to GST agarose beads. Twenty μL of the GST-bound beads were
resuspended in the binding buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.25 mM DTT, 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail,1 mM
PMSF). SPA1-MBP protein expression was induced in the BL21 cell as described in
the previous section. The induced cell pellets were resuspended and sonicated in
the lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Tween 20,
0.25 mM DTT, 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail,1 mM PMSF), cleared by
centrifugation at 20200 × g for 30 mins. The supernatant was then added to
prepared GST-PIF1 beads and incubated with or without increasing amount of
puriﬁed phyB (1–2 µg) from Pichia pastoris. After the pull-down, the beads were
washed three times, ﬁve min each with the binding buffer. Co-precipitated MBP-
SPA1, phyB and GST-PIF1 was immunoblotted with anti-MBP (NEB, Cat.#
E8032S), anti-strep (Sigma, Cat.# GT661), and anti-GST HRP (GE healthcare, Cat.
# RPN1236) antibodies.

In vitro phytochrome dimerization assay. Total 5 µg of Pichia pastoris puriﬁed
phyB-GFP FL and ΔC holoproteins were mixed with 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% Glycerol, 1% Bromophenol Blue). Native 6% PAGE gel was
prepared and ran in 4 °C, 100 v for 3 hours. The native PAGE gel was stained with
Coomassie brilliant blue staining solution and the proteins were visualized.

PIF1 sequestration assay using chromatin immunoprecipitation. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed as previously described71. In brief,
phyB-GFP FL/TAP-PIF1 and phyB-GFP ΔC/TAP-PIF1 were plated in MS media
and grown for 4 days in the dark. Final 10 µM bortezomib was pretreated in the
dark for 4 h before the red light irradiation to block 26 S proteasome-mediated

degradation of the TAP-PIF1. A pulse of red light (300 µmol s−2) treated for the
red samples and whole seedlings were subjected to cross-linking in 1% for-
maldehyde buffer for 15 min. The crosslinking was quenched by adding 2 M gly-
cine and incubated additional 5 min. The seedlings were collected and ground in
liquid nitrogen, resuspended in the nuclear isolation buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 15 mM
PIPES, 5 mM MgCl2, 60 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM PMSF,
1X protease inhibitor cocktail). Cleared by 15 min centrifugation at 20200 × g at
4 °C, the pellets were resuspended in 1 mL lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH7.5,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM PMSF, 1X pro-
tease inhibitor cocktail). Each sample was sonicated at 10% amplitude with
Branson Digital Soniﬁer (Model# PC BD 400 W 20 kHz) sonication machine (10
seconds each for ten times), total 100 seconds sonication. Samples were centrifuged
at 20,200 × g for 20 min. Ten percent of the supernatant was saved for input DNA
isolation. Anti-myc (Sigma, Cat.# C3956) antibody-bound Dyanbeads were then
added to the supernatant for PIF1 chromatin immunoprecipitation overnight.
Bound ChIP samples were washed sequentially with low salt, high salt, LiCl, and
TE wash buffer for 5 mins each. Eluted chromatin was then subjected to reverse
crosslinking by overnight incubation in the presence of NaCl. After proteinase K
treatment for an hour, DNA was isolated by DNA puriﬁcation kit (Qiagen, Cat.#
28106). Enrichment was measured by quantitative PCR using primers corre-
sponding to the G-box region on PIL1 promoter and PIL1 coding region were
compared as a negative control.

Protein extraction and western blot analyses. Seeds were surface sterilized and
grown in the dark for four-days otherwise indicated. For total protein extraction,
about 100 seeds were plated. The tissue was collected and ground in 100 μL
denaturing extraction buffer [100 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 8 M Urea, 1x
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, cat# 59), 2 mM
PMSF, + optional 25 mM β-GP, 10 mM NaF and 2 mM Na-orthovanadate for
PIF1 included samples] and cleared by centrifugation at 20,200 × g for 10 min at
4 °C. Samples were boiled for 5 min with 1X SDS sample buffer and separated on a
6.5% SDS-PAGE gel, blotted onto PVDF membranes, and probed with corre-
sponding antibodies. Antibodies used in these studies are anti-PIF138, anti-myc
(Sigma, Cat.# C3956 for immunoprecipitation, EMD Millipore, Cat#OP10-200UG
for Western blot), anti-GFP (Abcam, Cat.# ab6556 for immunoprecipitation), anti-
GFP (Santa Cruz. Cat.# sc-390394 for Western blot) anti-HA (Covance Cat.#
MMS-101P for Western blot), anti-MBP (NEB, Cat.# E8032S), and anti-RPT5
antibodies (Enzo Life Sciences, Cat.# BML-PW8770-0025). Secondary HRP bound
antibodies were visualized with Super Signal West Femto Chemiluminescent
substrate (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Waltham, USA.), and developed with an X-
ray ﬁlm. The PIF1 amount was quantiﬁed with image J from three independent
blots and normalized by its corresponding RPT5 levels.

Light-induced seed germination assay and measurement of hypocotyl lengths.
For measurement of hypocotyl lengths, the same batch of seeds were harvested and
dried in the presence of desiccation rocks at room temperature for 1 month.
Photographs of 4-day-old dark- and light-grown seedlings were taken and at least
20 seedlings were measured using the ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).

Seeds were harvested and dried at room temperature in the presence of

desiccation rocks for one month. Light-induced germination assay was performed
as described previously35. In brief, surface sterilized seeds were imbibed on the MS
media for one hour. Plates were initially treated with far-red light (10 µmol/s/m2)
for 5 mins and then irradiated with red light with the amount of light as indicated
in the ﬁgure. The plates were wrapped with aluminum foil twice and incubated at
22 °C for four days before counting germination frequency.

RNAseq analysis. Total six genotypes; Col-0, cop1-4, spaQ, phyAphyB/phyB-GFP
FL, and phyAphyB/phyB-GFP ΔC plants were used for mRNA sequence analysis.
The seeds were surface sterilized and plated on the MS media without sucrose, cold
stratiﬁed for three days before treated for 3 hours of white light and 21 h of dark
incubation to induce germination. After the initial 24 h, seeds were further treated
with far-red light (10 µmolm−2 s−1) to inactivate phytochrome activity. After an
additional two days in the dark, seedlings were either collected (dark sample) or
treated with 1 h of continuous red light (red sample) (3.5 µmolm−2 s−1). Total
RNA was isolated using the plant total RNA kit (Sigma, Cat.# STRN250). NEB-
Next® Ultra™ DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB Cat.# E7370S) was used to
generate mRNA sequencing library according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The constructed library was quality checked by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Wald-
broon, Germany) and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. Raw data and
processed data were deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus database
(accession number GSE117114).

For the RNA-seq data analysis, the quality of raw reads (FASTQ) was initially
checked using FastQC before aligned to the Arabidopsis genome using TopHat72
calling Bowtie273. Arabidopsis genome was acquired from TAIR10 (https://www.
arabidopsis.org/).

HTSeq-count v0.8.0 was used to generate counts of reads mapped to annotated
Arabidopsis genes74 (http://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html). The data
preprocessing, mapping and counting reads were performed using TACC
Stampede2 supercomputer.

Differentially expressed genes in each mutant compared to wild-type (WT)
were analyzed using DESeq2 package in R programming based on the negative
binomial distribution75. The differential gene expression from DESeq2 was selected
for signiﬁcant changes with the |log2FC| > 2 for Col-0, spaQ, cop1-4 and |log2FC| >
1.5 for phyB-GFP FL, phyB-GFP ΔC with adjusted p-value < 0.05, Wald test as part
of the DESeq2 package.

Venny v2.1.0 and ComplexHeatmap76 package in R were used to generate Venn
diagrams and heat maps. Enrichment analysis (Gene Ontology) was implemented
using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID) v6.8. In addition, to obtain the number of read per kilo bases per million
reads (RPKM), the aligned reads from TopHat were assembled and quantiﬁed
using Cufﬂinks72. Differentially expressed genes between two conditions were
analyzed by using Cuffdiff from Cufﬂinks. Signiﬁcantly difference was selected with
adjusted p-value < 0.05, Cuffdiff analysis.
