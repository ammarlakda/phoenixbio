The CeCDC-14 phosphatase is required for cytokinesis in the Caenorhabditis elegans
                embryo
paragraph
11984
Our analysis of the C. elegans genome had revealed only one ORF with significant
                homology to CDC14, C17G10.4, but because WormBase (http://www.wormbase.org)
                predicted three potential splice variants of this ORF, total worm cDNA preparations
                were subjected to RT-PCR. This analysis revealed a single product, corresponding to
                the smallest splice variant, C7G10.4c. Furthermore, sequencing of several ESTs
                derived from C17G10.4 also yielded only sequences corresponding to C17G10.4c
                (unpublished data). Similarly, only a single product, corresponding to the molecular
                mass predicted for C17G10.4c (76.7 kD) could be detected at the protein level (see
                below). Thus, although it would be premature to exclude the existence of minor
                splice variants, we conclude that the 76.7-kD product of C17G10.4c represents the
                major CDC14 phosphatase in C. elegans.

CeCDC-14 localizes to the central spindle in anaphase and the midbody in
                telophase. (A) Total worm extract (lanes 1 and 3) and lysate of insect cells
                infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding CeCDC-14 (lanes 2 and 4) were probed
                by immunoblotting with affinity-purified anti-CeCDC-14 antibodies, in the absence
                (lanes 1 and 2) or presence (lanes 3 and 4) of purified recombinant 6His-CeCDC-14.
                (B) Wild-type C. elegans embryos were subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy
                using affinity-purified anti-CeCDC-14 antibodies. Tubulin staining is shown in
                green, anti-CeCDC-14 staining in red, and DAPI in blue. Arrowheads mark the central
                spindle (top) and the midbody (bottom panel). (C) ZEN-4-GFP (MG170) embryos in the
                first zygotic division were stained with goat anti-GFP (green) and
                rabbit-anti-CeCDC-14 (red) antibodies. Yellow color indicates colocalization. The
                polar body extrusion remnant is indicated by an arrowhead and the central spindle by
                an arrow. Bars, 5 mum.

The staining patterns produced by anti-CeCDC-14 antibodies were very reminiscent
                of those observed with antibodies directed against the central spindle components
                ZEN-4, a mitotic kinesin (Powers et al., 1998; Raich et al., 1998), and its partner
                protein CYK-4, a Rho-GAP (Jantsch-Plunger et al., 2000; Mishima et al., 2002). To
                directly explore a possible colocalization between CeCDC-14 and ZEN-4, worms
                expressing a functional ZEN-4-GFP fusion protein (Kaitna et al., 2000) were stained
                with antibodies against GFP and CeCDC-14. As illustrated in Fig. 1 C, the two
                antigens displayed extensive colocalization at both the central spindle and the
                polar body (arrow and arrowhead, respectively).

In a minor proportion of embryos (6/36), the furrow only pinched in marginally
                before it regressed and cytokinesis failed. In some of these embryos, the
                pseudocleavage also appeared weaker or the spindle was placed more centrally than
                observed in wild-type embryos. Similar features have been observed in mutants
                defective in the establishment of polarity (Shelton et al., 1999; Rappleye et al.,
                2002) raising the possibility that the absence of CeCDC-14 might also have caused a
                polarity defect. However, when CeCDC-14-depleted embryos were stained with
                antibodies against P granules, these were found to display the same posterior
                localization as in wild-type embryos (Fig. 2 C). Staining with antibodies against
                PAR-2 and PAR-3, two further markers of polarity, also failed to reveal aberrations
                in the establishment of polarity, and most CeCDC-14-depleted embryos also displayed
                the characteristic flattening of the posterior spindle pole in anaphase (unpublished
                data; Keating and White, 1998). Thus, our results fail to support a major, direct
                role of CeCDC-14 in the establishment of polarity. On the other hand, considering
                that ~15% of CeCDC-14-depleted embryos did give indications of a polarity defect, it
                would be premature to rigorously exclude such a role. It remains possible that very
                low levels of residual phosphatase activity could suffice for a polarity-related
                function.

CeCDC-14-depleted embryos lack bundled midzone microtubules. (A) Wild-type and
                CeCDC-14-depleted embryos in the first anaphase were stained with anti-tubulin
                antibodies (green). DAPI staining is shown in blue. Arrowheads point to the central
                spindle (top), which is absent in CeCDC-14-depleted embryos. (B) Wild-type,
                CeCDC-14- and ZEN-4-depleted embryos in telophase were fixed with paraformaldehyde
                and stained with FITC-phalloidin. All three embryos showed cortical actin staining
                but only partial actin rings at the cleavage furrow were observed in CeCDC-14- and
                ZEN-4-depleted embryos (arrowheads). Bar, 5mum.

                antibodies (red). (B) Wild-type embryos and embryos depleted of CeCDC-14 by RNAi
                were stained with antibodies recognizing AIR-2 (red). Note that in the
                CeCDC-14-depleted embryo some microtubules were stained with anti-AIR-2 antibody
                (bottom row, arrow) whereas the chromosomes were not recognized by the antibody. DNA
                staining is in blue. Arrowheads point to the central spindle and midbodies.

From the analysis of fixed CeCDC-14-depleted embryos, it was impossible to
                determine whether the mislocalization of ZEN-4 was due to an inability of ZEN-4 to
                localize to the central spindle, or alternatively, reflected an unstable association
                of ZEN-4 with the spindle midzone. The latter mechanism had previously been
                described to underlie the ZEN-4 mislocalization phenotype in embryos injected with
                dsRNA for the C. elegans INCENP homologue, ICP-1 (Kaitna et al., 2000). To
                distinguish between the two possibilities, worms carrying a functional ZEN-4-GFP
                fusion (Kaitna et al., 2000) were injected with CeCDC-14 dsRNA, and
                CeCDC-14-depleted and control embryos were then observed in real time. In wild-type
                embryos, ZEN-4-GFP began to localize to the central spindle in anaphase, and
                subsequently formed a bright spot at the position of the midbody in telophase (n =
                4) (Fig. 5, left). However, in embryos depleted of CeCDC-14, no transient
                accumulation of ZEN-4-GFP could be observed at any time point (n = 6) (Fig. 5, right
                two panels). From the comparison of these results with those reported for embryos
                depleted of ICP-1 (Kaitna et al., 2000), it seems clear that depletion of CeCDC-14
                disturbs the organization of the central spindle more completely than depletion of
                ICP-1.
paragraph

To characterize the relationship between CeCDC-14 and ZEN-4 in more detail,
                embryos were also depleted of ZEN-4 by RNAi, and then analyzed by immunofluorescence
                microscopy, using anti-CeCDC-14 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 6, CeCDC-14 was
                completely lost from both the central spindle and the midbody in ZEN-4-depleted
                embryos (n = 25) (Fig. 6). The same result was obtained in CYK-4-depleted embryos
                (unpublished data). Together with the data presented in Fig. 4, this indicates that
                CeCDC-14 and the ZEN-4/CYK-4 complex are mutually dependent on each other for
                localization. In parallel, we also examined embryos depleted for AIR-2. In addition
                to a severe cytokinesis defect, such AIR-2-depleted embryos display problems with
                DNA segregation during anaphase, leading to chromatin bridges and unsegregated DNA
                masses in telophase (Schumacher et al., 1998; Kaitna et al., 2000). In most
                AIR-2-depleted embryos examined with anti-CeCDC-14 antibodies, no localized CeCDC-14
                staining could be seen (n = 20) (Fig. 6, bottom).
paragraph
32045
As described above, embryos depleted of CeCDC-14 clearly failed cell division, but
                remarkably they appeared to continue in the cell cycle. In fact, CeCDC-14-depleted
                embryos seemed to keep duplicating both their DNA and their centrosomes. This
                observation is in stark contrast with the situation in S. cerevisiae, in which
                cdc14-ts mutants, when shifted to the nonpermissive temperature, were unable to exit
                mitosis and instead arrested in anaphase with segregated chromosomes and high Cdk1
                activity (Visintin et al., 1998). To more carefully examine the influence of
                CeCDC-14 depletion on cell cycle progression, two types of analyses were carried
                out. First, embryos were dissected from worms at different times after injection of
                CeCDC-14-dsRNA, and the time required for these embryos to proceed through mitosis
                was measured. Most importantly, no cell cycle arrest could be observed at any time
                point (Table II). This was true even for batches of injected worms that were
                followed until oocytes failed to be fertilized due to depletion of the stored sperm.
                For embryos dissected at late time points (24-36 h after injection), our data
                suggested a possible increase in the length of mitosis (Table II). However, because
                it was difficult to measure the period between nuclear envelope breakdown and
                reformation accurately by DIC optics (note the relatively large standard error of
                the means in Table II), we also analyzed cell cycle progression in histone-GFP
                embryos. By filming such embryos, the time intervals between different mitotic
                events could be measured very accurately. As shown in Table III and Videos 1 and 2
                (available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200202054/DC1), no significant
                differences in the duration of the first mitosis could be observed between wild-type
                and CeCDC-14-depleted embryos.

Discussion
paragraph
38113
Surprisingly, our RNAi-based survey of potential C. elegans MEN/SIN homologues
                revealed an embryonic requirement only for the CeCDC-14 phosphatase. Several factors
                may contribute to explain this finding. First, two of the MEN/SIN components
                analyzed (Dbf2p and Mob1p) have more than one potential homologue in the C. elegans
                genome, raising the possibility of redundancy. In these cases, it might be necessary
                to simultaneously deplete all potential homologues in order to observe a phenotype.
                Second, it is possible that some of the MEN/SIN components serve to fulfill
                requirements specific to yeast cell budding or fission, respectively, and these
                functions may not have been conserved during evolution of metazoan organisms. Third,
                whether or not a particular gene product is required for cell cycle progression may
                depend on the developmental context. Consistent with this possibility, we have
                observed that depletion of two C. elegans kinases structurally related to MEN/SIN
                components (Dbf2p of S. cerevisiae and Sid1p of S. pombe) produced an F1 arrest at
                the L1 stage and degeneration of the germ line, respectively.

For real-time recordings of ZEN-4-GFP in C. elegans embryos, strain MG170 (zen-4
                [or 153ts]); (xsEx6 [zen-4-GFP]]) (Kaitna et al., 2000) was used. This strain was
                propagated at 25 C. Untreated or RNAi-injected MG170 worms were dissected as
                described above, and time-lapse recordings of GFP fluorescence were carried out as
                described previously (Jantsch-Plunger et al., 2000), using a Zeiss Axioplan 2
                microscope with a piezo stepper (Physik Instrumente), a CoolSnap camera for image
                acquisition and Metamorph software. The exposure time for GFP fluorescence was 100
                ms, and six frames, 2 mum apart, were taken every 15 s. Time-lapse recordings of
                histone H2B-GFP embryos were performed in a similar manner, with the exception that
                only two frames, 1.5 mum apart, were taken every 6 s in order to increase temporal
                resolution. Filming of histone-GFP embryos was carried out at 25 C. For data
                analysis, each stack of GFP images was projected onto a single plane, and the
                projections were processed for figures using Adobe Photoshop.

Total worm lysate was prepared by resuspending a worm pellet of 100 mul in 200 mul
                urea-buffer (Knop et al., 1996). The lysate was heated at 65 C for 10 min and 5 mul
                were applied per lane of an SDS-PAGE minigel. The separated proteins were
                transferred to Protran membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) and probed with
                affinity-purified anti-CeCDC-14 antibodies at a concentration of 0.25 mug/ml. For
                analysis of untagged recombinant CeCDC-14 protein, baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells
                were harvested 48 h postinfection with the C17G10.4c-virus. The cell pellet was
                lysed at 4 x 106 cells/ml in 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% IGEPAL, 1 mM
                Pefabloc (Roche), and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The lysate was
                centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm in a table top centrifuge and the supernatant
                diluted 1:10 with PBS. 5 mul was loaded per lane of an SDS-PAGE minigel and
                processed as described above.
