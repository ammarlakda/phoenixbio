0,Cancer science ,33211385; ,"Copy number alterations detected by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) can lead to the identification of novel cancer-related genes. We analyzed chromosomal aberrations in a set of 100 human primary colorectal cancers (CRCs) using CGH and found a solute carrier (SLC) 7A1 gene, which encodes cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1) with 14 putative transmembrane domains, in a chromosome region (13q12.3) with a high frequency of gene amplifications. SLC7A1/CAT1 is a transporter responsible for the uptake of cationic amino acids (arginine, lysine, and ornithine) essential for cellular growth. Microarray and PCR analyses have revealed that mRNA transcribed from CAT1 is overexpressed in more than 70% of human CRC samples, and RNA interference-mediated knockdown of CAT1 inhibited the cell growth of CRCs. Rats were immunized with rat hepatoma cells expressing CAT1 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP), and rat splenocytes were fused with mouse myeloma cells. Five rat monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (CA1 ~ CA5) reacting with HEK293 cells expressing CAT1-GFP in a GFP expression-dependent manner were selected from established hybridoma clones. Novel anti-CAT1 mAbs selectively reacted with human CRC tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues according to immuno-histochemical staining and bound strongly to numerous human cancer cell lines by flow cytometry. Anti-CAT1 mAbs exhibited internalization activity, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and migration inhibition activity against CRC cell lines. Furthermore, CA2 inhibited the in vivo growth of human HT29 and SW-C4 CRC tumors in nude mice. This study suggested CAT1 to be a promising target for mAb therapy against CRCs."
1,Revista iberoamericana de micologia ,20974273; ,"Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen that causes 90% of invasive aspergillosis (IA) due to Aspergillus genus, with a 50-95% mortality rate. It has been postulated that certain virulence factors are characteristic of A. fumigatus, but the ""non-classical"" virulence factors seem to be highly variable. Overall, published studies have demonstrated that the virulence of this fungus is multifactorial, associated with its structure, its capacity for growth and adaptation to stress conditions, its mechanisms for evading the immune system and its ability to cause damage to the host. In this review we intend to give a general overview of the genes and molecules involved in the development of IA. The thermotolerance section focuses on five genes related with the capacity of the fungus to grow at temperatures above 30°C (thtA, cgrA, afpmt1, kre2/afmnt1, and hsp1/asp f 12). The following sections discuss molecules and genes related to interaction with the host and with the immune responses. These sections include β-glucan, α-glucan, chitin, galactomannan, galactomannoproteins (afmp1/asp f 17 and afmp2), hydrophobins (rodA/hyp1 and rodB), DHN-melanin, their respective synthases (fks1, rho1-4, ags1-3, chsA-G, och1-4, mnn9, van1, anp1, glfA, pksP/alb1, arp1, arp2, abr1, abr2, and ayg1), and modifying enzymes (gel1-7, bgt1, eng1, ecm33, afpigA, afpmt1-2, afpmt4, kre2/afmnt1, afmnt2-3, afcwh41 and pmi); several enzymes related to oxidative stress protection such as catalases (catA, cat1/catB, cat2/katG, catC, and catE), superoxide dismutases (sod1, sod2, sod3/asp f 6, and sod4), fatty acid oxygenases (ppoA-C), glutathione tranferases (gstA-E), and others (afyap1, skn7, and pes1); and efflux transporters (mdr1-4, atrF, abcA-E, and msfA-E). In addition, this review considers toxins and related genes, such as a diffusible toxic substance from conidia, gliotoxin (gliP and gliZ), mitogillin (res/mitF/asp f 1), hemolysin (aspHS), festuclavine and fumigaclavine A-C, fumitremorgin A-C, verruculogen, fumagillin, helvolic acid, aflatoxin B1 and G1, and laeA. Two sections cover genes and molecules related with nutrient uptake, signaling and metabolic regulations involved in virulence, including enzymes, such as serine proteases (alp/asp f 13, alp2, and asp f 18), metalloproteases (mep/asp f 5, mepB, and mep20), aspartic proteases (pep/asp f 10, pep2, and ctsD), dipeptidylpeptidases (dppIV and dppV), and phospholipases (plb1-3 and phospholipase C); siderophores and iron acquisition (sidA-G, sreA, ftrA, fetC, mirB-C, and amcA); zinc acquisition (zrfA-H, zafA, and pacC); amino acid biosynthesis, nitrogen uptake, and cross-pathways control (areA, rhbA, mcsA, lysF, cpcA/gcn4p, and cpcC/gcn2p); general biosynthetic pathway (pyrG, hcsA, and pabaA), trehalose biosynthesis (tpsA and tpsB), and other regulation pathways such as those of the MAP kinases (sakA/hogA, mpkA-C, ste7, pbs2, mkk2, steC/ste11, bck1, ssk2, and sho1), G-proteins (gpaA, sfaD, and cpgA), cAMP-PKA signaling (acyA, gpaB, pkaC1, and pkaR), His kinases (fos1 and tcsB), Ca(2+) signaling (calA/cnaA, crzA, gprC and gprD), and Ras family (rasA, rasB, and rhbA), and others (ace2, medA, and srbA). Finally, we also comment on the effect of A. fumigatus allergens (Asp f 1-Asp f 34) on IA. The data gathered generate a complex puzzle, the pieces representing virulence factors or the different activities of the fungus, and these need to be arranged to obtain a comprehensive vision of the virulence of A. fumigatus. The most recent gene expression studies using DNA-microarrays may be help us to understand this complex virulence, and to detect targets to develop rapid diagnostic methods and new antifungal agents."
2,Journal of experimental botany ,17728292; ,"Catalase and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) have been extensively studied for their roles in various stress responses. However, little is known about the triggering mechanisms for stress-induced catalase gene expression or about H(2)O(2) production as a stress signal. It is reported here that ABA-, drought-, and salt stress-induced gene expression of CAT1 catalase is mediated by AtMEK1, an Arabidopsis MAPK kinase, by triggering H(2)O(2) signal production. Both CAT1 expression and AtMEK1 activity were activated by ABA, drought, and salt stresses. The mek1 mutant totally blocked stress-induced CAT1 expression and, interestingly, stress-induced H(2)O(2) production was also blocked. Over-expression of AtMEK1 significantly promoted stress-induced CAT1 expression, and also promoted H(2)O(2) production. These results conclusively indicate that stress-induced CAT1 expression is mediated by AtMEK1 and, furthermore, that the triggering of H(2)O(2) production might be involved in this process, as further proved by the observation that CAT1 expression was induced by applied H(2)O(2.) Surprisingly, the signalling mechanisms for stress-induced gene expression of CAT2 and CAT3 were very different from that of CAT1. Except for drought stress, expression of CAT2 or CAT3 was also activated by salt stress or ABA treatment, and AtMEK1 was not proved to be involved in the drought-induced expression of CAT2 or CAT3. Further studies showed that stomatal movement was much less sensitive to ABA in AtMEK1 mutant (mek1), and over-expression of AtMEK1 in Arabidopsis increased plant resistance to drought or salt stress, which further demonstrated that AtMEK1 is a crucial mediator in plant stress signal transduction."
3,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.) ",35781205; ,"The availability of exceptionally strong and tightly regulated promoters is a key feature of Komagataella phaffii (syn. Pichia pastoris), a widely applied yeast expression system for heterologous protein production. Most commonly, the methanol-inducible promoter of the alcohol oxidase 1 gene (PAOX1) and the constitutive promoter of the glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gene (PGAP) have been used. Recently, also promising novel constitutive (PGCW14), regulated (PGTH1, PCAT1), and bidirectional promoters (histone promoters and synthetic hybrid variants) have been reported.As natural promoters showed so far limited tunability of expression levels and regulatory profiles, various promoter engineering efforts have been undertaken for P. pastoris . PAOX1, PDAS2, PGAP, and PGCW14 have been engineered by systematic deletion studies or random mutagenesis of upstream regulatory sequences. New engineering strategies have focused on PAOX1 core promoter modifications by random or rational approaches and transcriptional regulatory circuits to render PAOX1 independent of methanol induction. These promoter engineering efforts in P. pastoris have resulted in improved, sequence-diversified synthetic promoter variants allowing coordinated fine-tuning of gene expression for a multitude of biotechnological applications."
4,PloS one ,35639710; ,"Positive and counter-selectable markers have been successfully integrated as a part of numerous genetic assays in many model organisms. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of resistance to arginine analog canavanine and its applicability for genetic selection in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Deletion of both the arginine permease gene cat1 and SPBC18H10.16/vhc1 (formerly mistakenly called can1) provides strong drug resistance, while the single SPBC18H10.16/vhc1 deletion does not have an impact on canavanine resistance. Surprisingly, the widely used can1-1 allele does not encode for a defective arginine permease but rather corresponds to the any1-523C>T allele. The strong canavanine-resistance conferred by this allele arises from an inability to deposit basic amino acid transporters on the cellular membrane. any1-523C>T leads to reduced post-translational modifications of Any1 regulated by the Tor2 kinase. We also demonstrate that any1-523C>T is a dominate allele. Our results uncover the mechanisms of canavanine-resistance in fission yeast and open the opportunity of using cat1, vhc1 and any1 mutant alleles in genetic assays."
5,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America ,6589635; ,"A regulatory element has been identified in maize that appears to exert an effect specifically on Cat1 gene expression in the scutellum of maize during early sporophytic development. Cat1 encodes CAT-1 catalase, one of two forms of catalase expressed in the scutellum during this developmental time period. Density-labeling experiments indicate that the regulatory element influences the overall levels of CAT-1 protein synthesis in the scutellum but has no effect on CAT-2 protein synthesis. Immunoprecipitation experiments of in vitro translation products suggest that this element has an effect on the level of translatable Cat1 mRNA associated with the scutellar polysomes. The element exhibits additive inheritance and is tissue and time specific in its action. This element, therefore, meets all the criteria of a regulatory gene and has been designated Car2. The element acts to regulate the temporal expression of the Cat1 structural locus in maize."
6,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB ,20347322; ,"A cDNA clone containing a catalase (CAT1) gene, designated PgCat1, was isolated from Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (Korean ginseng). PgCat1 is predicted to encode a precursor protein of 492 amino acid residues, and its sequence shares high degrees of homology with a number of other CAT1s. Genomic DNA hybridization analysis indicated that PgCat1 represents a multi-gene family. Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR results showed that PgCat1 expressed at different levels in leaves, stem, roots of P. ginseng seedlings. Different stresses, heavy metals, plant hormones, osmotic agents, high light irradiance, abiotic stresses, triggered a significant induction of PgCat1. The positive responses of PgCat1 to the various stimuli suggested that P. ginseng PgCat1 may help to protect the plant against reactive oxidant related environmental stresses."
7,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology ,8220459; ,"A genomic clone containing the maize Cat1 gene has been isolated and its complete DNA sequence determined. The start of transcription has been mapped by primer extension. Six introns were identified in the Cat1 coding region. In order to determine the tissue-specific expression pattern of the Cat1 gene, promoter-reporter gene fusion constructs were made consisting of 2.5 kb and 0.8 kb of the 5' Cat1 sequence fused to the coding region of the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene. These fusion constructs were introduced into Nicotiana tabacum cv. Burley 21 and the expression of Cat1-GUS in various tissues was examined. In transgenic tobacco, the Cat1 promoter can drive GUS expression at relatively high levels in mature seeds. GUS activity starts to accumulate at about 10 days after flowering, reaching a maximum at about 22 days after flowering, and decreases thereafter, but persists until after seed desiccation through early germination. Low levels of GUS activity can be detected in pollen. This corresponds to the Cat1 expression pattern observed in maize."
8,Food & function ,30238944; ,"Blueberry is rich in bioactive phytochemicals with a wide of range of biological activities and health benefits. However, little is known about their effects on aging. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of supplementation with a blueberry extract (BE) on lifespan and stress resistance using Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as a model. The mechanisms of these effects were explored using RNAi technology. The mean lifespan of C. elegans treated with BE at 50, 100, and 200 mg mL-1 was significantly increased by 22.2%, 36.5%, and 44.4%, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, supplementation with BE improved motility and decreased lipofuscin accumulation. C. elegans pretreated with BE were more resistant than untreated C. elegans to stresses (heat, ultraviolet-B radiation, and paraquat). Treatment with BE resulted in up-regulation of genes related to antioxidant systems, including sod-3, cat-1, mev-1, skn-1, mek-1, nhr-8, and daf-16. Suppression of daf-16 by RNAi shortened the lifespan of C. elegans and inhibited the expression of sod-3, suggesting that BE may regulate sod-3 downstream of daf-16 to extend lifespan and stress resistance. Our findings revealed that, in C. elegans, BE can prolong the lifespan, improve health indexes, and enhance stress resistance."
9,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology ,10792824; ,"The mechanisms by which the maize antioxidant Cat1 gene responds to abscisic acid (ABA) and osmotic stress have been investigated. Results show that during late embryogenesis, Cat1 expression in vivo is independent of endogenous ABA levels. However, exogenously applied ABA significantly enhances Cat1 expression. Transient assays using particle bombardment show that the proximal ABRE2 element on the Cat1 promoter is responsible for the induction of Cat1 expression by ABA. We further show that ABA induces the expression of Cat1 via the interaction between ABRE2 and one of its binding proteins, CBF1 (Cat1 binding factor 1). Using ABA-deficient mutant embryos, we show that osmotic stress induces Cat1 expression through two alternate signal transduction pathways: an ABA signaling pathway leading to the interaction between the ABRE2 motif and CBF1, and a pathway via the interaction of ABRE2 and CBF2 (Cat1 binding factor 2) that is independent of ABA. The data presented clearly suggest that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays an important intermediary role in the ABA signal transduction pathway leading to the induction of the Cat1 gene."
10,Cytokine ,32980687; ,"Hepatic fibrosis is characterized by abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the primary cells that produce ECM in response to hepatic injury, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) has been regarded as the central stimulus responsible for HSC-mediated ECM production. In the present study, we attempted to identify a critical factor in HSC activation and the underlying mechanism. By analyzing online microarray expression profiles, we found that the expression of high-affinity cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1) was upregulated in hepatic fibrosis models and activated HSCs. We isolated and identified mouse HSCs (MHSCs) and found that in these cells, CAT1 was most highly upregulated by TGF-β1 stimulation in both time- and dose-dependent manners. In vitro, CAT1 overexpression further enhanced, while CAT1 silencing inhibited, the effect of TGF-β1 in promoting MHSC activation. In vivo, CAT1 silencing significantly improved the hepatic fibrosis induced by both CCl4 and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In summary, CAT1 was significantly upregulated in TGF-β1-activated MHSCs and mice with hepatic fibrosis. CAT1 silencing inhibited TGF-β1-induced MHSC activation in vitro and fibrogenic changes in vivo. CAT1 is a promising target for hepatic fibrosis treatment that requites further investigation in human cells and clinical practice."
11,International journal of molecular sciences ,36233327; ,"WRKYs are one of the largest transcription factor (TF) families and play an important role in plant resistance to various stresses. TaWRKY133, a group I WRKY protein, responds to a variety of abiotic stresses, including PEG treatment. The TaWRKY133 protein is located in the nucleus of tobacco epidermal cells, and both its N-terminal and C-terminal domains exhibit transcriptional activation activity. Overexpression of TaWRKY133 reduced drought tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana, as reflected by a lower germination rate, shorter roots, higher stomatal aperture, poorer growth and lower antioxidant enzyme activities under drought treatment. Moreover, expression levels of stress-related genes (DREB2A, RD29A, RD29B, ABF1, ABA2, ABI1, SOD (Cu/Zn), POD1 and CAT1) were downregulated in transgenic Arabidopsis under drought stress. Gene silencing of TaWRKY133 enhanced the drought tolerance of wheat, as reflected in better growth, higher antioxidant enzyme activities, and higher expression levels of stress-related genes including DREB1, DREB3, ABF, ERF3, SOD (Fe), POD, CAT and P5CS. In conclusion, these results suggest that TaWRKY133 might reduce drought tolerance in plants by regulating the expression of stress-related genes."
12,Handbook of experimental pharmacology ,24756713; ,"TRPV6 (former synonyms ECAC2, CaT1, CaT-like) displays several specific features which makes it unique among the members of the mammalian Trp gene family (1) TRPV6 (and its closest relative, TRPV5) are the only highly Ca(2+)-selective channels of the entire TRP superfamily (Peng et al. 1999; Wissenbach et al. 2001; Voets et al. 2004). (2) Translation of Trpv6 initiates at a non-AUG codon, at ACG, located upstream of the annotated AUG, which is not used for initiation (Fecher-Trost et al. 2013). The ACG codon is nevertheless decoded by methionine. Not only a very rare event in eukaryotic biology, the full-length TRPV6 protein existing in vivo comprises an amino terminus extended by 40 amino acid residues compared to the annotated truncated TRPV6 protein which has been used in most studies on TRPV6 channel activity so far. (In the following numbering occurs according to this full-length protein, with the numbers of the so far annotated truncated protein in brackets). (3) Only in humans a coupled polymorphism of Trpv6 exists causing three amino acid exchanges and resulting in an ancestral Trpv6 haplotype and a so-called derived Trpv6 haplotype (Wissenbach et al. 2001). The ancestral allele encodes the amino acid residues C197(157), M418(378) and M721(681) and the derived alleles R197(157), V418(378) and T721(681). The ancestral haplotype is found in all species, the derived Trpv6 haplotype has only been identified in humans, and its frequency increases with the distance to the African continent. Apparently the Trpv6 gene has been a strong target for selection in humans, and its derived variant is one of the few examples showing consistently differences to the orthologues genes of other primates (Akey et al. 2004, 2006; Stajich and Hahn 2005; Hughes et al. 2008). (4) The Trpv6 gene expression is significantly upregulated in several human malignancies including the most common cancers, prostate and breast cancer (Wissenbach et al. 2001; Zhuang et al. 2002; Fixemer et al. 2003; Bolanz et al. 2008). (5) Male mice lacking functional TRPV6 channels are hypo-/infertile making TRPV6 one of the very few channels essential for male fertility (Weissgerber et al. 2011, 2012)."
13,Biochemical and biophysical research communications ,11676491; ,"The aniline-assimilating bacterium Acinetobacter lwoffii K24 has two cat gene clusters (cat1 and cat2). In this study, we completely sequenced 10-kb DNA fragment of cat1 genes of A. lwoffii K24, which had been cloned in plasmid pCD1-1. Sequence analysis revealed that the order of genes in the cat1 operon-containing gene cluster was ORF porin, catR1, catB1C1A1D, ORF1, and ORF2. Two ORFs located immediately downstream catD were most similar with two ORFs in cat gene cluster of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus ADP1 but the gene structure of catR1B1C1A1 was closest to that found in Frateurua sp. ANA-18 or Pseudomonas putida PRS2000. CatA1 gene product was significantly overexpressed and detected in SDS-PAGE when four cat1 genes (catB1C1A1D) were placed under the control of a lac promoter in pUC118 while overexpressions of other cat genes were accomplished under the control of a lac promoter in pET vector system. All gene products were verified by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Gel retardation assay revealed that the putative regulatory gene activator CatR1 for the catB1C1A1 operon could bind the promoter region of catB2 as well as catB1, suggesting that transcription of catB1 or catB2 might be controlled by the putative gene activator CatR1. However, the promoter regions of catA1 and catA2 were found to have no affinity with catR1."
14,Biochemical and biophysical research communications ,9473520; ,"Previously, we have reported that two clustered cat genes from Acenitobacter lwoffi K24 had different arrangements, catB1C1A1 and catB2A2C2 (Kim, S.I., S.-H.

By further analysis of the organization of the cat1 gene cluster, we obtained a complete sequence of the catB1 gene, which encoded 40.8-kDa polypeptide containing 379 amino acids, and found a open reading frame (ORF) coding a putative regulatory protein in upstream region of catB1 on plasmid pCD1-1. This ORF encoded 34.2-kDa polypeptide containing 379 amino acids and had more than 40% identity with catR, LysR family regulatory protein of Pseudomonas putida. RT-PCR, Northern blot analysis and primer extension assay for transcriptional analysis of the cat1 gene cluster revealed that the catB1C1 genes were cotranscribed and the catA1 gene was independently transcribed."
15,Frontiers in microbiology ,34512562; ,"Biofilm is an accumulation of cells, which are formed on mucosal surfaces of the host as well as on medical devices. The inherent resistance of Candida strains producing biofilms to antimicrobial agents is an important and key feature for biofilm growth, which can lead to treatment failure. This resistance is due to the regulatory increase of the output pumps, the presence of extracellular matrix, and the existence of persister cells. Persister cells are phenotypic variants that have MICs similar to antibiotic-sensitive populations and are able to tolerate high doses of antibiotics. The current study investigated the possible role of EFG1, BCR1, and CAT1 in the establishment or maintenance of persister cells in Candida albicans strains that produce biofilms."
16,Advances in experimental medicine and biology ,34251635; ,"Amino acids have pleiotropic roles in animal biology including protein and glucose synthesis, cellular metabolism, antioxidant reactions, immune enhancers, and inducers or suppressors of gene expression. Recent studies have revealed important roles of amino acids in the regulation of gene expression in animals. Discoveries of cellular amino acid sensors and their mechanistic pathways have broadened our understanding of how the body responds to the deprivation of nutrients and amino acids in particular. Alterations in concentrations of extracellular amino acids can modulate transcription, translation, posttranscriptional modifications, and epigenetic regulation of genes and proteins. Cells have intracellular amino acid sensors, for example, Sestrin2 for leucine and CASTOR2 for arginine, that respond to sufficiency or deficiency in amino acids, thereby inhibiting or activating downstream signals for gene expression, respectively. The sufficiency of an amino acid in cells ensures its binding to cognate sensors and suppression of inhibitors of MTOR, leading to increased global protein synthesis. On the other hand, deprivation of amino acids activates the amino acid response pathway (GCN2-eIF2a-ATF4), leading to increased selective translation of the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Deficiency of an amino acid itself or via the action of ATF4 suppression of MTORC1 activity limits global protein synthesis. ATF4, in response to low concentrations of cellular amino acids, mediates the transcription of groups of genes such as those for amino acid transport and biosynthesis (ASNS, CAT-1, SNAT2), autophagy (ATG3, ATG10, ATG12), and serine-glycine synthesis (PHGDH, PSAT1, PSPH, MTHFD2). Long-term amino acid starvation has a pronounced effect on cells: suppressed expression and translation of genes required for normal cell growth and metabolism and enhanced expression of genes required for cell adaptation and survival. Levels of amino acids also affect the posttranslational modifications of proteins through mechanisms such as acetylation, ADP-ribosylation, disulfide bond formation, glutamylation, and hydroxylation."
17,Biochemical and biophysical research communications ,11401523; ,"Ca(2+) signaling is important for growth and survival of prostatic carcinoma (PCa) cells. Here we report that the gene for CaT1, a channel protein highly selective for Ca(2+), is expressed at high levels in human PCa and in the LNCaP PCa cell line. CaT1 mRNA levels were elevated in PCa specimens in comparison to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) specimens and positively correlated with Gleason grade in a PCa series. CaT1 mRNA was suppressed by androgen and was induced by a specific androgen receptor antagonist in LNCaP cells, suggesting that the gene is negatively regulated by androgen. These findings are the first to implicate a Ca(2+) channel in PCa progression and suggest that CaT1 may be a novel target for therapy."
18,mSphere ,30760608; ,"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) methodology is not only an efficient tool in gene editing but also an attractive platform to facilitate DNA, RNA, and protein interactions. We describe here the implementation of a CRISPR-based system to regulate expression in the clinically important yeast Candida albicans By fusing an allele of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 devoid of nuclease activity to a transcriptional repressor (Nrg1) or activator (Gal4), we were able to show specific repression or activation of the tester gene CAT1, encoding the cytosolic catalase. We generated strains where a 1.6-kbp upstream regulatory region of CAT1 controls the expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and demonstrated the functionality of the constructs by quantitative PCR (qPCR), flow cytometry, and analysis of sensitivity/resistance to hydrogen peroxide. Activation and repression were strongly dependent on the position of the complex in this regulatory region. We also improved transcriptional activation using an RNA scaffolding strategy to allow interaction of inactive variants of Cas9 (dCas9) with the RNA binding protein MCP (monocyte chemoattractant protein) fused to the VP64 activator. The strategy shown here may facilitate the analysis of complex regulatory traits in this fungal pathogen.IMPORTANCE CRISPR technology is a new and efficient way to edit genomes, but it is also an appealing way to regulate gene expression. We have implemented CRISPR as a gene expression platform in Candida albicans using fusions between a Cas9 inactive enzyme and specific repressors or activators and demonstrated its functionality. This will allow future manipulation of complex virulence pathways in this important fungal pathogen."
19,Photodiagnosis and photodynamic therapy ,33857598; ,"The study evaluated the effect of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) and nystatin (NYS) in the expression of genes (ACT1, ALS1, CAP1, CAT1, EFG1, HWP1, LIP3, PLB1, SAP1, and SOD1) involved in the virulence of Candida albicans strains recovered from patients with denture stomatitis (DS). These strains were isolated from the patients before (initial) and after treatment (final), and 45 days after the treatments (follow-up). For gene expression analyses, RNA was isolated from the clinical strains, followed by cDNA synthesis and qPCR using specific primers for each target gene. The samples that present integrity were pooled to increase the RNA yield. In the end, four patients treated with aPDT and five patients treated with NYS had the clinical isolates of C. albicans submitted to gene expression evaluation. The data demonstrated a statistical difference in the expression of PLB1 and ACT1 for the different therapies (aPDT versus NYS). Also, there was a statistical difference in the expression of CAT1, SOD1, and LIP3 at the time intervals assessed (initial, final, and follow-up). In contrast, no statistical difference was found in the expression of ALS1, HWP1, EFG1, CAP1, CAT1, SOD1, LIP3, and SAP1 between the therapies, while no significant difference was detected at the time intervals evaluated for ALS1, HWP1, EFG1, CAP1, and SAP1. Therefore, the topical treatments for DS with aPDT or NYS did not effect the expression of most C. albicans virulence genes evaluated."
20,"Journal, genetic engineering & biotechnology ",30647630; ,"The response of Peganum harmala L. seedlings subjected to salinity was investigated through the observation of germination at the 4th, 6th and 8th days under normal and two salinity levels (150 and 200 mM NaCl). Genetic response of P. harmala was examined by quantitative estimation and electrophoretic separation of catalase and salt-soluble proteins. The gene expression of catalase and osmotin were investigated using RT-PCR. Final percentage of germination at the eighth day of germination was reduced from 85% in the control to 70 and 30% under the concentration of 150 and 200 mM. The catalase activity and protein content increased as the salinity increased compared to control seedlings. The electrophoretic separation of catalase and salt-soluble proteins exhibited stress-related isozymes and protein bands. RT-PCR of cat1, cat2-3 and cat3 and osmotin genes exhibited up-regulation and down-regulation of genes subsequent to salinity. The reduced germination percentage of salt stressed seedlings was attributed to oxidative damage and osmotic imbalance. The increased catalase activity and protein content were concluded as protective response of P. harmala seedlings to salinity induced oxidative stress and osmoregulation. The additional isozyme bands in the salt-stressed seedlings indicated modulation of CAT gene expression in response to elevated H2O2 subsequent to salinity. The stress specific gene expression was interpreted as molecular mechanism by which plants can tolerate salinity stress. The up-regulation of cat2-3 gene in relation to stress suggests it crucial role in salinity tolerance in P. harmala and further studies are needed for its sequence identification."
21,Genes ,36011356; ,"Kengyilia is a newly established genus. Most species in this genus survive in hash environment, which might be an indicator of an acquirement of stress resistance genes and the potential for molecular breeding in Triticeae species. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a widely used technique with varied sensitivity heavily dependent on the optimal level of the reference genes. K. melanthera is a typical psammophyte species which has high drought resistance. The reference genes of K. melanthera are not yet reported. This study aims to evaluate the expression stability of 14 candidate reference genes (EF1A, GAPDH, ACT1, UBI, TUBB3, TIPRL, CACS, PPP2R1B, TUBA1A, EIF4A1, CYPA3, TCTP, ABCG11L, and FBXO6L) under five treatments (drought, heat, cold, salt, and ABA) and find the most stable and suitable one even upon stressed conditions. The software NormFinder, GeNorm, BestKeeper, and RefFinder were used for data analysis. In general, the genes CACS and PPP2R1B are concluded to have the best overall performance under the various treatments. With the ABA treatment, TCTP and TIPRL show the best stability. CACS and TCTP, as well as TIPRL and CYPA3, were most stable under the treatments of cold and salt, respectively. CACS and FBXO6L were ranked the highest with the heat treatment and drought treatment, respectively. Finally, the Catalase-1 (CAT1) gene was used to verify the reliability of the above reference genes. Accordingly, CAT1's expression pattern remained unchanged after normalization with stable reference genes. This study provides beneficial information about the stability and reliability of potential reference genes for qRT-PCR in K. melanthera."
22,The Journal of biological chemistry ,12361955; ,"T-lymphocyte activation requires sustained Ca(2+) signaling dependent upon capacitative Ca(2+) entry (CCE). The protein(s) that forms the stores-operated Ca(2+) channel (SOCC) responsible for CCE has long been sought but has not been definitively identified. Members of the TRPV family (transient receptor potential superfamily-vanilloid receptor subfamily) of channel genes have been proposed to encode SOCCs responsible for CCE in non-excitable cells. Here we present evidence that a member of the TRPV group, CaT1, is involved in generating I(CRAC), the CCE current that is necessary for T-cell activation. CaT1 is expressed in Jurkat T-lymphocytes. When overexpressed in Jurkat cells, CaT1 produces a Ca(2+) entry current that mimics the endogenous I(CRAC) in its dependence on external Ca(2+), inactivation by elevated concentration of internal Ca(2+), and pharmacological block by capsaicin. Overexpressed CaT1 is partially regulated by the release of internal Ca(2+) stores via thapsigargin or receptor-mediated generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. A pore-region mutant of CaT1, TRIA-CaT1, fails to carry Ca(2+) currents and associates with co-expressed wild type CaT1 to functionally suppress permeation of Ca(2+) ions. Expression of the TRIA-CaT1 mutant in Jurkat cells results in suppression of the endogenous I(CRAC). Taken together these results indicate that CaT1 is the channel protein that contributes to T-lymphocyte SOCCs either alone or as a subunit in a heterogeneous channel complex."
23,Bioresource technology ,33845315; ,"Here, Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) coupling simultaneous saccharification and fermentation for butyric acid production using rice straw was constructed. Clostridium tyrobutyricum Δack::cat1, with deleted ack gene and overexpressed cat1 gene, was used as the butyric-acid-fermentation strain. MOFs was employed as a photocatalyst to improve butyric acid production, as well as a cytoprotective exoskeleton with immobilized cellulase for the hydrolysis of rice straw. Thus, the survival of MOFs-coated strain, the thermostability and pH stability of cellulase both remarkably increased. As a result, 55% of rice straw was hydrolyzed in 24 h, and the final concentration of butyric acid in visible light was increased by 14.23% and 29.16% compared to uncoated and coated strain without visible light, respectively. Finally, 26.25 g/L of butyric acid with a productivity of 0.41 g/L·h in fed-batch fermentation was obtained. This novel process inspires green approach of abundant low-cost feedstocks utilization for chemical production."

Currently, there is therefore a gap in knowledge regarding the underlying molecular similarities and differences of FF in different disease entities."
25,Gene ,29496557; ,"Although its powerful impact on most co-morbidities has been widely demonstrated, the metabolic outcomes of bariatric surgery (BS) show a great heterogeneity among patients. Haplotypes of one of the major antioxidant enzyme, catalase (CAT), are associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. The haplotype referred to as CAT1 includes homozygous carriers of CATH1 [-844G,-89A,-20T], whereas CAT2 haplotype includes heterozygous carriers (CATH1/CATH2) and CATH2 homozygous [-844A,-89T,-20C]. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of CAT1 and CAT2 haplotypes on traditional cardiovascular and metabolic markers one year after BS in a women population. The 294 women with a body mass index (BMI) >35 kg/m2 were followed-up for one year after BS, monitoring their anthropometric, metabolic and inflammatory parameters. CAT1 patients had significantly improved diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and Creactive protein (CRP) levels compared to CAT2 one year after BS. In untreated women at baseline, the change of CRP one year after BS was higher in CAT1 patients. In the population of women receiving at least one anti-lipidic, anti-hypertensive or anti-diabetic treatment at baseline, DBP and fat mass were lower one year after BS in CAT1 patients and the greater change of fat mass was associated with a higher change of adiponectin. The results highlight the beneficial impact of the CAT1 haplotype on traditional cardiovascular and metabolic parameters after BS. Our findings suggest that the CAT1 haplotype could be implicated in the level of metabolic and cardiovascular improvement after BS."
26,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology ,18248592; ,"Catalase controls cellular H(2)O(2) and plays important roles in the adaptation of plants to various stresses, but little is known about the signaling events that lead to the expression of CAT1 and the production of H(2)O(2). Here we report the dependence of CAT1 expression and H(2)O(2) production on a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. CAT1 transcript was induced in an ABA-dependent way and the induction was abolished in the T-DNA insertion mutant mkk1 (SALK_015914), while AtMKK1 overexpression significantly enhanced the ABA-induced CAT1 expression and H(2)O(2) production. AtMPK6, another component in the MAPK cascade, was also involved: mpk6 mutant blocked and overexpressing AtMPK6 enhanced the ABA-dependent expression of CAT1 and H(2)O(2) production. The activity of AtMPK6 was increased by ABA in an AtMKK1-dependent manner. These data clearly suggest an ABA-dependent signaling pathway connecting CAT1 expression through a phosphorelay including AtMKK1 and AtMPK6. In further support of this view, mkk1 mutant reduced both the sensitivity to ABA during germination and the drought tolerance of seedlings, whereas the AtMKK1 overexpression line showed the opposite responses when compared with the wild type. The data suggest AtMKK1-AtMPK6 to be a key module in an ABA-dependent signaling cascade causing H(2)O(2) production and stress responses."
27,Non-coding RNA ,35202090; ,"MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate cellular processes by the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, including immune responses. The shift in the miRNA profiling of murine macrophages infected with Leishmania amazonensis can change inflammatory response and metabolism. L-arginine availability and its conversion into nitric oxide by nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2) or ornithine (a polyamine precursor) by arginase 1/2 regulate macrophage microbicidal activity. This work aimed to evaluate the function of miR-294, miR-301b, and miR-410 during early C57BL/6 bone marrow-derived macrophage infection with L. amazonensis. We observed an upregulation of miR-294 and miR-410 at 4 h of infection, but the levels of miR-301b were not modified. This profile was not observed in LPS-stimulated macrophages. We also observed decreased levels of those miRNAs target genes during infection, such as Cationic amino acid transporters 1 (Cat1/Slc7a1), Cat2/Slc7a22 and Nos2; genes were upregulated in LPS stimuli. The functional inhibition of miR-294 led to the upregulation of Cat2 and Tnfa and the dysregulation of Nos2, while miR-410 increased Cat1 levels. miR-294 inhibition reduced the number of amastigotes per infected macrophage, showing a reduction in the parasite growth inside the macrophage. These data identified miR-294 and miR-410 biomarkers for a potential regulator in the inflammatory profiles of microphages mediated by L. amazonensis infection. This research provides novel insights into immune dysfunction contributing to infection outcomes and suggests the use of the antagomiRs/inhibitors of miR-294 and miR-410 as new therapeutic strategies to modulate inflammation and to decrease parasitism."
28,Current opinion in gastroenterology ,17024033; ,"Some key advances occurred last year in understanding mechanisms involved in nutrient absorption. A novel ""prechylomicron transport vesicle"" was identified; its movement to the Golgi is the rate-limiting step for triacylglycerol absorption. A scavenger receptor (type BI) in the brush border membrane appears to facilitate cholesterol uptake. Several studies define mechanisms for gastrointestinal peptide hormone stimulation of glucose uptake. An oligopeptide transporter, PepT1, is transcriptionally upregulated by certain dietary amino acids and dipeptides. Surprisingly, both insulin and fasting double the maximum velocity for dipeptide uptake (via PepT1), but they act by different mechanisms. Three transporters, SMVT (sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter for biotin and pantothenate), SVCT (for vitamin C), and CaT1 (for Ca uptake from the lumen) have been cloned and are active when expressed in various cells. Additional studies provide insights on Ca absorption and vitamin D action in aging, estrogen deficiency, and adaptation to a low Ca diet. Nramp2, also called DMT1 (divalent metal ion transporter), seems to be a major regulator of transferrin-independent, nonheme iron uptake. Finally, the protein HFE associates with the transferrin receptor and is part of an iron-sensing mechanism that regulates iron absorption. It is defective in hereditary hemochromatosis. HFE and Nramp2 (DMT1) genes are reciprocally regulated."
29,Free radical biology & medicine ,10889447; ,"The effect of wounding on catalase expression was examined in embryos and leaves of maize. All three Cat genes are upregulated in response to wounding in immature embryos. Cat expression also increased in response to jasmonic acid (JA), raising the possibility that JA and wounding may share a common signal transduction pathway in upregulating Cat mRNA in immature embryos. In young leaves, only Cat1 and Cat3 transcripts increase in response to wounding, but JA does not play a role. Cat1 and Cat3 transcript accumulation also increases in response to wounding in both wild-type and mutant leaves deficient in abscisic acid (ABA), implying that Cat1 and Cat3 induction in response to wounding is not mediated by ABA in leaves. Transient assays using the Cat1 promoter fused with the reporter gene Gus, showed that the DNA sequence motif responsible for Cat1 upregulation by wounding overlaps with the ABA-responsive element (ABRE, G-box) in the Cat1 promoter. The exact nature of the signals triggering the Cat responses to wounding is not clear at this point, but some evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a role in this response. In fact, we have found that endogenous H(2)O(2) levels increase in wounded leaves. Thus, wounding may indirectly induce the production of H(2)O(2) in leaves, triggering the antioxidant response."

We identified the human ortholog (hCaT1) of a recently cloned rat calcium transport protein, CaT1, that mediates intestinal calcium uptake. hCaT1 messenger RNA is present in the gastrointestinal tract, including esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon. High levels of hCaT1 transcripts are also present in pancreas, placenta, prostate, and salivary gland, while moderate levels are present in liver, kidney, and testis. hCaT1 mRNA is also expressed in the colorectal cancer cell line, SW480, and the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, K-562. The hCaT1 gene was assigned to the long arm of chromosome 7, bands q33-34, by fluorescence in situ hybridization. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, hCaT1 promotes saturable Ca(2+) uptake with a Michaelis constant of 0.25 mM. Our studies suggest a role for hCaT1 in cellular calcium uptake in a variety of tissues, including the transcellular calcium transport pathway in intestine."
31,Journal of chemical ecology ,34988771; ,"For the characterization of BOA-OH insensitive plants, we studied the time-dependent effects of the benzoxazolinone-4/5/6/7-OH isomers on maize roots. Exposure of Zea mays seedlings to 0.5 mM BOA-OH elicits root zone-specific reactions by the formation of dark rings and spots in the zone of lateral roots, high catalase activity on root hairs, and no visible defense reaction at the root tip. We studied BOA-6-OH- short-term effects on membrane lipids and fatty acids in maize root tips in comparison to the benzoxazinone-free species Abutilon theophrasti Medik. Decreased contents of phosphatidylinositol in A. theophrasti and phosphatidylcholine in maize were found after 10-30 min. In the youngest tissue, α-linoleic acid (18:2), decreased considerably in both species and recovered within one hr. Disturbances in membrane phospholipid contents were balanced in both species within 30-60 min. Triacylglycerols (TAGs) were also affected, but levels of maize diacylglycerols (DAGs) were almost unchanged, suggesting a release of fatty acids for membrane lipid regeneration from TAGs while resulting DAGs are buildings blocks for phospholipid reconstitution, concomitant with BOA-6-OH glucosylation. Expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and of ER-bound oleoyl desaturase (FAD2-2) genes were contemporaneously up regulated in contrast to the catalase CAT1, while CAT3 was arguably involved at a later stage of the detoxification process. Immuno-responses were not elicited in short-terms, since the expression of NPR1, POX12 were barely affected, PR4 after 6 h with BOA-4/7-OH and PR1 after 24 h with BOA-5/6-OH. The rapid membrane recovery, reactive oxygen species, and allelochemical detoxification may be characteristic for BOA-OH insensitive plants."
32,Free radical biology & medicine ,9214587; ,"The catalase multi-gene family in Arabidopsis includes three genes encoding individual subunits which associate to form at least six isozymes that are readily resolved by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. CAT1 and CAT3 map to chromosome 1, and CAT2 maps to chromosome 4. The nucleotide and deduced amino acids sequences of the three coding regions are highly related to each other and to other catalases. Both the individual isozymes and the individual subunit mRNAs show distinct patterns of spatial (organ-specific) expression. Six isozymes are detected in flowers and leaves and two are seen in roots. All three mRNAs are highly expressed in inflorescences, and CAT2 and CAT3 are highly expressed in leaves. All three mRNAs are detectable in freshly imbibed seeds, although the pattern of mRNA relative abundance varies among the three genes during early germination. CAT1 and CAT2 mRNA abundance is induced by light. In contrast, CAT3 is negatively light-responsive. CAT2 and CAT3 mRNA abundance is controlled by the circadian clock. Interestingly, the peak in CAT3 mRNA abundance occurs in the subjective evening, which is out of phase with expression of the Arabidopsis CAT2 catalase gene that shows clock-regulated expression gated to the subjective early morning. CAT1 mRNA abundance is not clock-regulated."
33,Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology ,19562367; ,"Since arginine metabolites, such as nitric oxide and polyamines, influence the expression of genes involved in erythroid differentiation, the transport of the cationic amino acid may play an important role in erythroid cells. However, available data only concern the presence in these cells of CAT1 transporter (system y(+)), while no information exists on the role of the heterodimeric transporters of system y(+)L (4F2hc/y(+)LAT1 and 4F2hc/y(+)LAT2) which operates transmembrane arginine fluxes cis-inhibited by neutral amino acids in the presence of sodium. Using erythroleukemia K562 cells and normal erythroid precursors, we demonstrate here that arginine transport in human erythroid cells is due to the additive contributions of a leucine-sensitive and leucine-insensitive component. In both cell types, leucine inhibition of arginine influx is much less evident in the absence of sodium, a hallmark of system y(+)L. In K562 cells, N-ethylmaleimide, a known inhibitor of CAT transporters (system y(+)), suppresses only a fraction of arginine influx corresponding to leucine-insensitive uptake. Moreover, in Xenopus oocytes coexpressing 4F2hc and y(+)LAT2, leucine exerts a marked inhibition of arginine transport, partially dependent on sodium, while no inhibition is seen in oocytes expressing CAT1. Lastly, silencing of SLC7A6, the gene for y(+)LAT2, lowers arginine transport and doubles the intracellular content of the cationic amino acid in K562 cells. We conclude that arginine transport in human erythroid cells is due to both system y(+) (CAT1 transporter) and system y(+)L (4F2hc/y(+)LAT2 isoform), which mainly contribute, respectively, to the influx and to the efflux of the cationic amino acid."

The order of the cat2 gene cluster is catB2A2C2, which has not been found in other bacteria. In this report, we analyzed the transcriptional pattern of the cat2 gene cluster and completely sequenced a 5.8 kbp fragment containing the compactly clustered catB2A2C2 genes and four ORFs. Similar to the ORF(R1) of the cat1 gene cluster, an ORF highly homologous with the catR gene was found 102 by upstream of the catB2 gene and was designated as ORF(R2). Three ORFs, one putative reductase component (ORF(X2)) and two putative LysR family regulatory proteins (ORF(Y2), ORF(Z2)) were located next to the catC2 gene in the opposite direction of the cat2 gene cluster. Two ORFs, ORF(X2) and ORF(Y2), were significantly homologous with tdnB and tdnR of the aniline oxygenase complex of Pseudomonas putida UCC22. RT-PCR analysis and Northern blotting revealed that the catB2 gene is independently transcribed and that the catA2C2 genes are cotranscribed. A primer extension assay revealed that transcription of the catA2C2 gene starts in the C-terminal region of the catB2 gene. These results suggest that the cat2 gene cluster may be under a different gene adaptation from other cat gene clusters."
35,Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR ,9618445; ,"Glucose and related sugars repress the transcription of genes encoding enzymes required for the utilization of alternative carbon sources; some of these genes are also repressed by other sugars such as galactose, and the process is known as catabolite repression. The different sugars produce signals which modify the conformation of certain proteins that, in turn, directly or through a regulatory cascade affect the expression of the genes subject to catabolite repression. These genes are not all controlled by a single set of regulatory proteins, but there are different circuits of repression for different groups of genes. However, the protein kinase Snf1/Cat1 is shared by the various circuits and is therefore a central element in the regulatory process. Snf1 is not operative in the presence of glucose, and preliminary evidence suggests that Snf1 is in a dephosphorylated state under these conditions. However, the enzymes that phosphorylate and dephosphorylate Snf1 have not been identified, and it is not known how the presence of glucose may affect their activity. What has been established is that Snf1 remains active in mutants lacking either the proteins Grr1/Cat80 or Hxk2 or the Glc7 complex, which functions as a protein phosphatase. One of the main roles of Snf1 is to relieve repression by the Mig1 complex, but it is also required for the operation of transcription factors such as Adr1 and possibly other factors that are still unidentified. Although our knowledge of catabolite repression is still very incomplete, it is possible in certain cases to propose a partial model of the way in which the different elements involved in catabolite repression may be integrated."
36,Microbiology and immunology ,18352908; ,"Although the catalase gene (CAT1) disruptant of the human pathogenic yeast Candida albicans was viable under ordinary growth conditions, we previously found that it could not grow on YPD (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose) containing SDS or at higher growth temperatures. To investigate the pleiotrophic nature of the disruptant, we examined the effect of the catalase inhibitor 3-AT on the growth of wild-type strains. Surprisingly, the addition of 3-AT and SDS caused the wild-type cells to be non-viable on YPD plates. We found an additional phenotype of the catalase gene disruptant: it did not produce normal hyphae on Spider medium. Hyphal growth was observed in a CAP1 (Candida AP-1-like protein gene) disruptant, a HOG1 (high-osmolarity glycerol signaling pathway gene) disruptant, and the double CAP1/HOG1 disruptant, suggesting that the defect in hyphal formation by the catalase disruptant was independent of these genes. Addition of 3-AT and SDS to hyphae-inducing media suppressed growth of normal hyphae in the wild-type strain. The potential necessity for catalase action upon exposure to hyphae-inducing conditions was confirmed by the immediate elevation of the catalase gene message. In spite of the requirement for catalase during hyphal growth, the catalase gene disruptant was capable of forming germ tubes in medium containing serum."
37,Journal of microbiological methods ,29454005; ,"Biofilm production contributes to several human diseases, including oral candidiasis. Among the Candida species, Candida albicans is the most prevalent. The expression of virulence genes is implicated in the pathogenic potential of Candida biofilms. However, the evaluation of microbial gene expression from in vivo biofilm samples is not trivial, specifically, assessment via quantitative PCR (qPCR) can be a challenge because of several species present in clinical samples. Hence, the necessity of primers specificity. The aim of this study was to evaluate through in silico and in vitro analyses the specificity of published primers and newly designed primers for C. albicans virulence genes: ALS1, CAP1, CAT1, EFG1, HWP1, LIP3, PLB1, SAP1, SAP4, SOD1, SOD5 and ACT1 (normalizing gene). In silico analysis was performed through a PubMed search of articles with primer sequences that evaluated gene expression of C. albicans. Then, the sequence similarity of twenty-eight primers was checked through BLASTn and ClustalW2. The analysis of secondary structures was performed using mfold. When the primers did not present satisfactory characteristics (absence of secondary structures, not discrepant Tm of forward and reverse sequences and specificity) following in vitro analysis (i.e., end point PCR), new primers were designed using Beacon Designer™ and sequences obtained from the ""Candida Genome Database"". The selected primers were tested in vitro by end point PCR using a panel of genomic DNA from five different Candida species (C. albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida dubliniensis, Candida krusei, and Candida tropicalis). The resulting PCR products were visualized on agarose gel. qPCR reactions were performed to determine primers' optimal concentration and PCR efficiency. End point PCR demonstrated that published primers for the SAP1 and HWP1 were specific for C. albicans and the one for SOD1 reacted with C. albicans and C. dubliniensis. The sequence of primers designed for ACT1, ALS1 and HWP1 genes were specific for C. albicans, while the ones for CAP1, CAT1, EFG1, LIP3, and PLB1 were detected in C. albicans and C. dubliniensis. After optimization, all primers presented a single peak on melt curves, correlation coefficient of ≅1 and qPCR reaction efficiency of 90-110%, with slope of ≅-3.3. Therefore, these primers should be suitable for future gene expression analyses from clinical samples."
38,Genetics ,9584109; ,"Angiosperms (flowering plants), including both monocots and dicots, contain small catalase gene families. In the dicot, Arabidopsis thaliana, two catalase (CAT) genes, CAT1 and CAT3, are tightly linked on chromosome 1 and a third, CAT2, which is more similar to CAT1 than to CAT3, is unlinked on chromosome 4. Comparison of positions and numbers of introns among 13 angiosperm catalase genomic sequences indicates that intron positions are conserved, and suggests that an ancestral catalase gene common to monocots and dicots contained seven introns. Arabidopsis CAT2 has seven introns; both CAT1 and CAT3 have six introns in positions conserved with CAT2, but each has lost a different intron. We suggest the following sequence of events during the evolution of the Arabidopsis catalase gene family. An initial duplication of an ancestral catalase gene gave rise to CAT3 and CAT1. CAT1 then served as the template for a second duplication, yielding CAT2. Intron losses from CAT1 and CAT3 followed these duplications. One subclade of monocot catalases has lost all but the 5'-most and 3'-most introns, which is consistent with a mechanism of intron loss by replacement of an ancestral intron-containing gene with a reverse-transcribed DNA copy of a fully spliced mRNA. Following this event of concerted intron loss, the Oryza sativa (rice, a monocot) CAT1 lineage acquired an intron in a novel position, consistent with a mechanism of intron gain at proto-splice sites."

In this study, we analyzed the expression level of microRNA-122 (miRNA-122) and its target mRNA, CAT1, in intact young male minipigs fed either high-cholesterol or standard diet for 11 wk. MiRNA-122 and CAT1 are known to be important regulators of lipid metabolism. The weight of the young minipigs was monitored once a week during the feeding period; measurements of total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins, and low-density lipoproteins were recorded at 4 time points (8, 14, 16, and 19 wk of age) in fasting animals during the feeding scheme. Body weight, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoproteins were higher in pigs fed the high-cholesterol compared with the standard diet. In contrast, the level of triglycerides was lower in pigs on the high-cholesterol diet than those receiving the standard diet. Pigs fed high-cholesterol also had lower miRNA-122 levels than did those fed the standard diet. These results suggest that in our minipigs, the increase in weight and cholesterol levels resulting from subchronic (11 wk) feeding of a high-cholesterol diet is correlated with a decrease in the expression of miRNA-122, confirming the implication of this microRNA in obesity. Gene expression levels of CAT1 did not differ between groups."

By screening for mutants that failed to derepress a UAS2PCK1-CYC1-lacZ reporter gene we isolated the new recessive derepression mutation cat5. The CAT5 gene encodes a protein of 272 amino acids showing a 42% identity to the ZC395.2 gene product of Caenorhabditis elegans whose function is unknown. Deletion of CAT5 caused a complete loss of glucose derepression affecting gluconeogenic key enzymes. Respiration, but not mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity, was also affected. CAT5 expression is 5- to 6-fold repressed by glucose, and CAT5 transcriptional activation was dependent on CAT1 (SNF1), CAT8 and CAT5 itself. The CAT5 gene is necessary for UAS1PCK1 and UAS2PCK1 protein binding since a carbon source-specific interaction was no longer detectable in cat5 mutants. Glucose derepression of gluconeogenesis depends on the active Cat1 (Snf1) protein kinase and the Cat8 zinc cluster activator. Mig1p-independent overexpression of CAT8 did not stimulate activation of gluconeogenic promoters in cat1 and in cat5 mutants. Since Cat8p multicopy expression suppresses the ethanol growth deficiency in cat1 (snf1) mutants, these results indicate that activation of Cat8p by the Cat1p (Snf1p) kinase and the Cat5p protein might be necessary for release from glucose repression."

However, there are few reports on the role of CBF gene in stress responses of Malus plant. In this experiment, a new CBF TF was separated from M. baccata which was named MbCBF1. MbCBF1 protein was found to be localized in the nucleus after subcellular localization. Furthermore, the expression of MbCBF1 was highly accumulated in new leaves and roots due to the high influence of cold and high salt in M. baccata seedlings. After introducing MbCBF1 into A. thaliana, transgenic A. thaliana can better adapt to the living conditions of cold and high salt. The increased expression of MbCBF1 in A. thaliana also increased the contents of proline, remarkablely improved the activities of SOD, POD and CAT, but the content of MDA was decreased. Although the chlorophyll content also decreased, it decreased less in transgenic plants. In short, above date showed that MbCBF1 has a positive effect on improving A. thaliana cold and high salt tolerance. MbCBF1 can regulate the expression of its downstream gene in transgenic lines, up-regulate the expression of key genes COR15a, RD29a/bandCOR6.6/47 related to low temperature under cold conditions and NCED3, CAT1, P5CS1, RD22, DREB2A,PIF1/4, SOS1 and SnRK2.4 related to salt stress under high salt conditions, so as to further improve the adaptability and tolerance of the transgenic plants to low temperature and high salt environment."

Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) stably overexpressing CAT1 (HEK-CAT1) and vector-transfected control cells (HEK-VC) were established to determine cellular uptake of labeled [(3)H]ADMA and [(3)H]l-arginine. Uptake of ADMA and l-arginine were significantly (p<0.001) higher in HEK-CAT1 than in HEK-VC at all investigated concentrations. Apparent V(max) values of cellular ADMA and l-arginine uptake by CAT1 were 26.9 ± 0.8 and 11.0 ± 0.2 nmol mg protein(-1) min(-1), respectively. K(m) values were 183 ± 21 μmoll(-1) (ADMA) and 519 ± 36 μmoll(-1) (l-arginine). Uptake of ADMA was inhibited by l-arginine and SDMA with IC(50) values (95% CI) of 227 (69-742) μmoll(-1) and 273 (191-390) μmoll(-1), respectively. ADMA and SDMA inhibited CAT1-mediated uptake of l-arginine with IC(50) values of 758 (460-1251) μmoll(-1) and 789 (481-1295) μmoll(-1), respectively. Efflux of ADMA was significantly increased in HEK-CAT1 cells as compared to HEK-VC (p<0.05). CAT1 mediates the cellular uptake of ADMA. In its physiological concentration range ADMA is unlikely to impair CAT1-mediated transport of l-arginine. Conversely, high (but still physiological) concentrations of l-arginine can inhibit CAT1-mediated cellular uptake of ADMA."

MicroRNAs have been shown to be involved in the development of many cancers, but little is known about their role in the process of colorectal liver metastasis. We compared miRNA expression between primary colorectal tumors and liver metastasis to identify those involved in the process of metastasis. Cancer cells were isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary CRC samples and their corresponding metastatic liver tumors in six patients using laser capture microdissection, and miRNA expression was analyzed using TaqMan miRNA arrays. The most abundant miRNA in liver metastasis compared with primary tumors was miR-122. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the expression levels of cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1), a negative target gene of miR-122, were lower in liver metastases than primary tumors (P < 0.001). Expression levels of CAT1 in 132 primary tumors were negatively correlated with the existence of synchronous liver metastasis (P = 0.0333) and tumor stage (P < 0.0001). In an analysis of 121 colon cancer patients without synchronous liver metastasis, patients with CAT1-low colon cancer had significantly shorter liver metastasis-free survival (P = 0.0258) but not overall survival or disease-free survival. Overexpression of miR-122 and concomitant suppression of CAT1 in the primary tumor appears to play important roles in the development of colorectal liver metastasis. Expression of CAT1 in the primary CRC has the potential to be a novel biomarker to predict the risk of postoperative liver metastasis of CRC patients."
44,Scientific reports ,28684763; ,"Low plasma concentration of L-homoarginine is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events and total mortality. Experimental data indicate that supplementation of L-homoarginine may have protective effects. We aimed to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the cellular uptake of L-homoarginine, which are little understood, so far. Using human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell lines stably overexpressing the human cationic amino acid transporters CAT1 [solute carrier family 7 (SLC7A1)], CAT2A (SLC7A2A) or CAT2B (SLC7A2B) we assessed the transport kinetics of L-homoarginine and interactions with the CAT substrates L-arginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Significant uptake of L-homoarginine was observed for all three CATs with apparent KM-values of 175 ± 7 µM for CAT1 and 523 ± 35 µM for CAT2B. Saturation of CAT2A-mediated L-homoarginine uptake could not be reached. Uptake of L-homoarginine by any of the three CATs could be inhibited by L-arginine and ADMA. Significant inhibition of CAT1-mediated uptake of L-homoarginine by L-arginine already occurred in the physiological concentration range. Taken together these data demonstrate that L-homoarginine is a substrate of CAT1, CAT2A and CAT2B and that CAT1 is a key site with regard to physiological relevance and interactions with related substrates such as L-arginine."
45,Poultry science ,22802189; ,"Chick embryos derive nutrients from the yolk during incubation and transition to intestinal absorption of nutrients posthatch. The uptake of nutrients is mediated by a variety of membrane-bound transporter proteins. The objective of this study was to determine the expression profiles of nutrient transporters and digestive enzymes during incubation in the yolk sac membrane (YSM) and embryonic intestine of egg-laying (Leghorn) and meat-producing (Cobb) chickens derived from 22 to 30 wk (young) and 45 to 50 wk (old) breeder flocks. Transporters examined included the peptide transporter PepT1, the glutamate/aspartate (EAAT3), cationic (CAT-1) and neutral (B0AT) amino acid transporters, and the fructose (GLUT5) and glucose (SGLT1) transporters. Digestive enzymes included aminopeptidase N (APN) and sucrase-isomaltase (SI). Expression of these genes was assessed by real-time PCR using the absolute quantification method in YSM at embryonic day (E) 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, and 21 and intestine at E15, 17, 19, 20, and 21. The PepT1 and APN gene expression in the YSM increased until E15 and then decreased until E21, whereas expression in the intestine increased from E15 to E21. The B0AT showed a similar pattern, with greatest expression in the YSM occurring at E17/E19. The CAT1 and GLUT5 genes showed decreased expression in the YSM and increased expression in the intestine until E17/E19 and then a decrease until E21. Expression of SGLT1 and EAAT3 showed increased gene expression over time in both the intestine and YSM. Expression of SI showed little to no gene expression in the YSM, whereas the intestine exhibited consistently high levels of gene expression. In YSM and intestine, SI expression was greater in Leghorn than Cobb, whereas CAT1 and GLUT5 expression was greater in Cobb than Leghorn. Expression of the APN, CAT1, and SI genes was greater in embryos from young flocks than old flocks in YSM and intestine. These results demonstrate that the YSM expresses many of the digestive enzymes and nutrient transporters typically associated with the intestine and that these genes show tissue- and development-specific patterns of expression."
46,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland) ",35326248; ,"The Bcl-2-associated athanogene (BAG) proteins are a family of multi-functional group of co-chaperones regulators, modulating diverse processes from plant growth and development to stress response. Here, 10 members of SlBAG gene family were identified based on the available tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) genomic information and named as SlBAG1-10 according to their chromosomal location. All SlBAG proteins harbor a characteristic BAG domain, categorized into two groups, and SlBAG4, SlBAG7, and SlBAG9 of group I contain a plant-specific isoleucine glutamine (IQ) calmodulin-binding motif located in the N terminus. The quantitative real-time PCR expression analysis revealed that these SlBAG genes had organ-specific expression patterns and most SlBAG genes were differentially expressed in multiple abiotic stresses including drought, salt, high temperature, cold, and cadmium stress as well as abscisic acid and H2O2. In addition, heterologous overexpression of SlBAG9 increased the sensitivity of Arabidopsis to drought, salt, and ABA during seed germination and seedling growth. The decreased tolerance may be due to the downregulation of stress-related genes expression and severe oxidative stress. The expression levels of some stress and ABA-related genes, such as ABI3, RD29A, DREB2A, and P5CS1, were significantly inhibited by SlBAG9 overexpression under osmotic stress. Meanwhile, the overexpression of SlBAG9 inhibited the expression of FSD1 and CAT1 under stress conditions and the decreased levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase enzyme activities were detected accompanying the trends in the expression of both genes, which resulted in H2O2 accumulation and lipid peroxidation. Taken together, these findings lay a foundation for the future study of the biological function of SlBAG genes in tomato."
47,Eukaryotic cell ,16963629; ,"In the present study, we sought to elucidate the contribution of the Cryptococcus neoformans catalase gene family to antioxidant defense. We employed bioinformatics techniques to identify four members of the C. neoformans catalase gene family and created mutants lacking single or multiple catalase genes. Based on a phylogenetic analysis, CAT1 and CAT3 encode putative spore-specific catalases, CAT2 encodes a putative peroxisomal catalase, and CAT4 encodes a putative cytosolic catalase. Only Cat1 exhibited detectable biochemical activity in vitro, and Cat1 activity was constitutive in the yeast form of this organism. Although they were predicted to be important in spores, neither CAT1 nor CAT3 was essential for mating or spore viability. Consistent with previous studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the single (cat1, cat2, cat3, and cat4) and quadruple (cat1 cat2 cat3 cat4) catalase mutant strains exhibited no oxidative-stress phenotypes under conditions in which either exogenous or endogenous levels of reactive oxygen species were elevated. In addition, there were no significant differences in the mean times to mortality between groups of mice infected with C. neoformans catalase mutant strains (the cat1 and cat1 cat2 cat3 cat4 mutants) and those infected with wild-type strain H99. We conclude from the results of this study that C. neoformans possesses a robust antioxidant system, composed of functionally overlapping and compensatory components that provide protection against endogenous and exogenous oxidative stresses."
48,3 Biotech ,34603917; ,"The study aimed to decipher the impact of multiple drought stress on wheat. To that effect, Geumgangmil, PL 337 (1AL.1RS), PL 371 (1BL.1RS), and PL 257 (1DL.1RS) seedlings were subjected to four treatments: G1 (control), G2 (stressed thrice with rewatering), G3 (stressed twice with rewatering), and G4 (single stressful event). The findings provided a comprehensive framework of drought-hardening effect at physiological, biochemical, and gene expression levels of drought-stressed wheat genotypes. The treatments resulted in differentially higher levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), soluble sugar, and proline accumulation, and reduced relative water content (RWC) in wheat plants. Photosynthetic pigment (chlorophyll and carotenoid) levels, the membrane stability index (MSI), and shoot biomass decreased dramatically and differently across genotypes, particularly in G3 and G4 compared to G2. The activity of antioxidant enzymes [ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT)] increased with the duration and severity of drought treatment. Furthermore, the relative expression of DREB, LEA, HSP, P5CS, SOD1, CAT1, APX1, RBCL, and CCD1 genes was higher in G2 than in other treatments. Drought hardening increased drought tolerance and adaptability in plants under G2 by enhancing growth and activating defensive mechanisms at the physio-biochemical and molecular levels. The findings of the study indicated that early drought stress exposure-induced acclimation (hardening), which enhanced tolerance to subsequent drought stress in wheat seedlings. The findings of this study will be useful in initiating a breeding program to develop wheat cultivars with improved drought tolerance."
49,Experimental physiology ,25958845; ,"What is the central question of this study? What is the potential role of endothelial NO production via overexpression of the l-arginine transporter, CAT1, as a mitigator of cardiac hypertrophy? What is the main finding and its importance? Augmentation of endothelium-specific l-arginine transport via CAT1 can attenuate pressure-overload-dependent cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Our findings support the conclusion that interventions that improve endothelial l-arginine transport may provide therapeutic utility in the setting of myocardial hypertrophy. Such modifications may be introduced by exercise training or locally delivered gene therapy, but further experimental and clinical studies are required. Endothelial dysfunction has been postulated to play a central role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, probably as a result of reduced NO bioavailability. We tested the hypothesis that increased endothelial NO production, mediated by increased l-arginine transport, could attenuate pressure-overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Echocardiography and blood pressure measurements were performed 15 weeks after transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in wild-type (WT) mice (n = 12) and in mice with endothelium-specific overexpression of the l-arginine transporter, CAT1 (CAT+; n = 12). Transverse aortic constriction induced greater increases in heart weight to body weight ratio in WT (by 47%) than CAT+ mice (by 25%) compared with the respective controls (P ≤ 0.05). Likewise, the increase in left ventricular wall thickness induced by TAC was significantly attenuated in CAT+ mice (P = 0.05). Cardiac collagen type I mRNA expression was greater in WT mice with TAC (by 22%; P = 0.03), but not in CAT+ mice with TAC, compared with the respective controls. Transverse aortic constriction also induced lesser increases in β-myosin heavy chain mRNA expression in CAT+ mice compared with WT (P ≤ 0.05). Left ventricular systolic pressure after TAC was 36 and 39% greater in WT and CAT+ mice, respectively, compared with the respective controls (P ≤ 0.001). Transverse aortic constriction had little effect on left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in both genotypes. Taken together, these data indicate that augmenting endothelial function by overexpression of l-arginine transport can attenuate pressure-overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy."
50,Planta ,16341707; ,"The enzyme catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) is inactivated by light and must be continuously replaced by new synthesis in order to maintain a constant enzyme activity in leaves. In winter rye leaves (Secale cereale L.) posttranscriptional mechanisms determine the rate of new catalase synthesis, including a light-controlled reversible modification of the catalase cat1 mRNA by methylation which greatly enhanced its translation efficiency. The specificity and regulation of this mRNA activation were further investigated. The translation efficiency of the rye cat1 mRNA was much more enhanced by N-7 methylation of the cap than that of an lhcb transcript. Investigations with truncated rye cat1 mRNAs indicated that the translational enhancement resulting from N-7 cap methylation did not require the presence of specific sequences of cat1 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions. Translational activation of the cat1 mRNA in rye leaves was independent of photosynthesis and most effectively induced by blue light. Peroxides (H(2)O(2), tertiary butyl hydroperoxide) and conditions enforcing an H(2)O(2) accumulation in the leaves (aminotriazole, paraquat) also caused an activation of the cat1 mRNA. A search for further signalling systems controlling the replenishment of inactivated catalase in light suggested that an inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate-mediated liberation of Ca(2+) from internal stores and a protein phosphatase played some role. However, these signalling systems did not affect the activation of the cat1 mRNA. After removal of Ca(2+) by EGTA the cat1 mRNA was rapidly degraded."

The aPDT was mediated by two photosensitizing agents (PSs) Photodithazine® (PDZ at 100 and 200 mg/L) or Curcumin (CUR at 40 and 80 μM) and LED (37.5 J/cm2 or 50 J/cm2). The quantification of the expression was performed by Reverse Transcription-Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) using specific primers for the target genes. The data were analyzed by Analysis of Variance (α = 0.05), followed by Tukey's post-test. It was observed reduction in the expression of ALS1, HWP1, CAP1, CAT1, and SOD1 when aPDT was performed using 200 mg/L PDZ and 80 μM CUR associated to LED (37.7 and 50 J/cm2, respectively) and using 100 mg/L PDZ and 40 μM CUR with LED of 50 J/cm2 (versus control). Also, the expression of CAP1 and SOD1 genes was reduced after aPDT using 100 mg/L PDZ and LED of 37.5 J/cm2. There was a significant reduction in the expression of genes HWP1, CAP1, and SOD1 after aPDT using 40 μM CUR and 37.5 J/cm2 (versus the control group). The application of LED only at 37.5 and 50 J/cm2 promoted down-regulation of ALS1, CAP1, CAT1, and SOD1 genes (versus the control group). Therefore, aPDT mediated by LED -associated PSs PDZ and CUR promoted a reduction in the expression of the five C. albicans genes evaluated."
52,Frontiers in plant science ,36388506; ,"Climate change causes plants encountering several abiotic stresses simultaneously. Responses of plants to a single stress has been comprehensively studied, but it is hard to speculated infer the effects of stress combination based on these researches. Here, the response mechanism of bermudagrass to low temperature and salt treatment was investigated in this study. The results showed that low temperature (LT) treatment decreased the relative growth rate, chlorophyll fluorescence transient curve, biomass, and crude fat content of bermudagrass, whereas low temperature + salt (LT+S) treatment greatly undermined these declines. Furthermore, at 6 h and 17 d, the expression levels of glyoxalase I (GLYI), Cu-Zn/superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn/SOD), peroxidase 2 (POD2), and oxidative enzyme 1(CAT1) in roots were considerably higher in the low temperature + salt treatment than in the low temperature treatment. Low temperature stress is more detrimental to bermudagrass, but mild salt addition can mitigate the damage by enhancing photosynthesis and improving the expression of antioxidant system genes (Cu-Zn/SOD, POD2 and CAT1) and glyoxalase system GLYI gene in roots. This study summarized the probable interaction mechanism of low temperature and salt stress on bermudagrass, which can provide beneficial reference for the growth of fodder in cold regions."
53,The Journal of biological chemistry ,9614060; ,"Arginine transport is important for a number of biological processes in vertebrates, and its transport may be rate-limiting for the production of nitric oxide. The majority of L-Arg transport is mediated by System y+, although several other carriers have been kinetically defined. System y+ cationic amino acid transport is mediated by proteins encoded by a family of genes, Cat1, Cat2, and Cat3. High affinity L-arginine transport was investigated in embryonic fibroblast cells derived from Cat1 knockout mice that lack functional Cat1. Both wild type and knockout cells transport arginine with comparable Km and Vmax. However, the apparent affinity for lysine transport was 2.4 times lower in Cat1(-/-) cells when compared with wild type cells, a property characteristic of Cat3-mediated transport. Northern analysis-documented Cat2 mRNA increased 2-fold, whereas Cat3 mRNA levels increased 11-fold in Cat1(-/-) relative to Cat1(+/+) cells. The low affinity Cat2a mRNA was not detectably expressed in these cells. Even though Cat3 expression is normally limited to adult brain, there was a large increase in the amount of Cat3 protein present at the plasma membrane of Cat1(-/-) embryonic fibroblast cells. These results suggest that Cat3 compensates for the loss of functional Cat1 in cells derived from Cat1 knockout mice and mediates the majority of high affinity arginine transport."
54,Plant physiology ,7846155; ,"We previously demonstrated that amounts of Cat1 RNA in developing immature maize (Zea mays L.) embryos change in parallel with endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) content. In excised immature embryos, addition of ABA leads to a large increase in Cat1 RNA accumulation. The Cat1 transcript, however, also accumulates to high amounts in scutella of germinating embryos, where ABA content is low and decreasing. Here we show that application of ABA to germinated embryos no longer results in the up-regulation of the Cat1 transcript accumulation that is seen during embryogenesis. This suggests that factors other than ABA control Cat1 expression at this developmental stage. Using band-shift and southwestern analyses, we show that the change in sensitivity to ABA is paralleled by changes in nuclear proteins binding to a 28-bp region of the Cat1 promoter in vitro. One protein (CAT1BP-20) shows increased accumulation in the absence of ABA, suggesting that a repressor-mediated mechanism accounts for at least a portion of the ABA regulation of Cat1."

B ,26055913; ,"The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between gene expression of nutrient (amino acid, peptide, sodium and proton) transporters in the small intestine and embryonic growth in domestic pigeons (Columba livia). One hundred and twenty-five fertilized eggs were randomly assigned into five groups and were incubated under optimal conditions (temperature of 38.1 °C and relative humidity of 55%). Twenty embryos/birds from each group were sacrificed by cervical dislocation on embryonic day (E) 9, 11, 13, 15 and day of hatch (DOH). The eggs, embryos (without yolk sac), and organs (head, brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidney, gizzard, small intestine, legs, and thorax) were dissected, cleaned, and weighed. Small intestine samples were collected for RNA isolation. The mRNA abundance of intestinal nutrient transporters was evaluated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We classified these ten organs into four types according to the changes in relative weight during embryonic development. In addition, the gene expression of nutrient transporters was differentially regulated by embryonic day. The mRNA abundances of b(0,+)AT, EAAT3, y(+)LAT2, PepT1, LAT4, NHE2, and NHE3 increased linearly with age, whereas mRNA abundances of CAT1, CAT2, LAT1, EAAT2, SNAT1, and SNAT2 were increased to higher levels on E9 or E11 and then decreased to lower levels until DOH. The results of correlation analysis showed that the gene expressions of b(0,+)AT, EAAT3, PepT1, LAT4, NHE2, NHE3, and y(+)LAT2 had positive correlations with body weight (0.71<correlation coefficient (CC)<0.82, P<0.0001), while CAT1, CAT2, EAAT2, SNAT1, and SNAT2 had negative correlations with body weight (-0.86<CC<-0.64, P<0.0001). The gene expressions of b(0,+)AT, EAAT3, LAT4, PepT1, NHE2, NHE3, and y(+)LAT2 showed positive correlations with intestinal weight (0.80<CC<0.91, P<0.0001), while CAT1, CAT2, and EAAT2 showed negative correlations with intestinal weight (-0.84<CC<-0.67, P<0.0001). It was concluded that the differences between growth trajectories of organs and gene expression of nutrient transporters in small intestine were due to their functional and physiological properties, which provided a comprehensive study of amino acid and peptide transporter mRNA in the small intestine during embryonic growth of pigeons."

The present experiment was conducted to investigate the main expression sites of nutrient transporters and the effects of GCs on the gene expression of these transporters in the rabbit small intestine. The results showed that peptide transporter 1 (PepT1), facultative amino acid transporter (rBAT), neutral amino acid transporter (B0AT), excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3), sodium-glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) and glucose transporter 5 (GLUT5) were mainly expressed in the distal segment, glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) and fatty-acid-binding protein 4 (FATP4) were mainly expressed in the proximal segment and cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1) was mainly expressed in the middle segment of the rabbit small intestine. In addition, we analysed the effects of 3 h (short-term) or 7 days (long-term) dexamethasone (DEX) treatment on the gene expression of most nutrient transporters. The results showed that short-term DEX treatment significantly decreased PepT1, B0AT, EAAT3, rBAT and SGLT1 expressions in all small intestinal segments, while it significantly decreased GLUT2 in the duodenum and FATP4 in the duodenum and ileum (P < 0.05). Long-term DEX treatment also significantly decreased PepT1, CAT1, B0AT, EAAT3, rBAT and SGLT1 in all small intestinal segments and significantly decreased GLUT2 in the jejunum and FATP4 in the ileum (P < 0.05). In conclusion, DEX could decrease the gene expression of most nutrient transporters (except GLUT5) and affect the transport of intestinal amino acids, monosaccharides and fatty acids."

Dry mature seeds from transgenic plants carrying the CAT1-GUS or CAT2-GUS constructs, in which the GUS gene was fused to the 5'-flanking region of cat1 or cat2, respectively, contained significant GUS activity, indicating that the promoters of cat1 and cat2 were active during seed development. GUS activity increased in response to germination in the seeds of transgenic tobacco that carried CAT1-GUS, as well as in those that carried CAT2-GUS. During the post-germinative stage the GUS activity directed by CAT2-GUS increased still further, whereas that directed by CAT1-GUS decreased. The changes in GUS activity in the transgenic tobacco plants that carried CAT1-GUS and CAT2-GUS were similar to the changes in the levels of transcripts of cat1 and cat2, respectively, in castor bean. The results suggest that the expression of cat1 and cat2 in the germinating seeds and post-germinative seedlings is regulated mainly at the level of transcription. However, the distribution of GUS activity among the organs of the transgenic tobacco seedlings and plantlets, which was examined by histochemical staining and by enzymatic assays of tissue extracts, was not identical to that of transcripts of cat1 and cat2 in castor bean. Histochemical analysis also revealed the interesting spatial regulation of the expression of the promoter of cat2 in the transgenic tobacco seedlings."

However, organosilicon toxicity in aquatic animals is seldom known. In this research, two typical silicone or silane coupling agents (KH-560 (3-Glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane) and KH-570 (3-Methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane)) were used in a hydroponic experiment to evaluate the effects on survival rate, antioxidant response and gene expression in red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). Crayfishes were grown in black aquaculture boxes containing different concentrations (0, 10, 100 and 1000 mg L-1) of KH-560 and KH-570 for 72 h, and then crayfish samples were harvested and separated into tissues of carapace, gill and muscle for analysis. The results showed that silicone significantly increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content in muscle by 17%-38% except for the treatment of 100 mg L-1 KH-570, and reduced the survival rate of crayfish. Additionally, silicone KH-570 increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) by 15%-31%, 17%-35%, and 9%-46%, as well as the contents of ascorbate (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) by 19%-31%, and 23%-29% respectively, in muscle tissue, and similar results occurred in KH-560. In the carapace, however, SOD activity was significantly decreased at high concentrations level of both silicone treatments. Moreover, silicon (Si) content was higher in the abdominal muscle of crayfish after silicone treatment. Assay of gene expression showed an obvious increasing expression of antioxidant related genes (Sod1, Sod2, Cat1, Cat2, and Pod1, Pod2) under silicone stress. The above results suggested that silicone caused an obvious stress response in crayfish in both biochemical and molecular levels."

Recently, probiotics have demonstrated their potential in treating biofilm-related diseases, including caries. However, limited studies have assessed their effect on cariogenic bacteria-fungi cross-kingdom biofilm formation and their underlying interactions. Here, we assessed the effect of four probiotic Lactobacillus strains (Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 2836, Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 8014, Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 14917, and Lactobacillus salivarius ATCC 11741) on S. mutans and C. albicans using a comprehensive multispecies biofilm model that mimicked high caries risk clinical conditions. Among the tested probiotic species, L. plantarum demonstrated superior inhibition on the growth of C. albicans and S. mutans, disruption of virulent biofilm formation with reduced bacteria and exopolysaccharide (EPS) components, and formation of virulent microcolonies structures. Transcriptome analysis (RNA sequencing) further revealed disruption of S. mutans and C. albicans cross-kingdom interactions with added L. plantarum. Genes of S. mutans and C. albicans involved in metabolic pathways (e.g., EPS formation, carbohydrate metabolism, glycan biosynthesis, and metabolism) were significantly downregulated. More significantly, genes related to C. albicans resistance to antifungal medication (ERG4), fungal cell wall chitin remodeling (CHT2), and resistance to oxidative stress (CAT1) were also significantly downregulated. In contrast, Lactobacillus genes plnD, plnG, and plnN that contribute to antimicrobial peptide plantaricin production were significantly upregulated. Our novel study findings support further assessment of the potential role of probiotic L. plantarum for cariogenic biofilm control."

To evaluate antibiotic resistance, the sequencing method could be considered the method of choice. The E. coli was identified by either specific biochemical tests or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the 16S rRNA gene. The results of aadA1 gene sequences demonstrated 10 nucleic acid substitutions throughout, as compared to the reference NCBI database (MG385063). Out of the 10 nucleic acid substitutions, 9 missense effects were observed. While the dfrA1 gene sequences illustrated 20 nucleic acid substitutions throughout, compared to the reference NCBI database (KY706080), out of the 20 nucleic acid substitutions, 8 missense effects were observed. Furthermore, the sul1 gene sequences displayed 20 nucleic acid substitutions throughout, in comparison with the reference NCBI database (CP069561), and out of the 20 nucleic acid substitutions, 12 missense effects were detected. The cat1 gene sequences showed 14 nucleic acid substitutions throughout, compared to the reference NCBI database (NC017660), and out of the 14 nucleic acid substitutions, 8 missense effects were observed.

62,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology ,10908810; ,"Catalase gene expression was characterized in the scutellum of maize seedlings grown at normal (25 degrees C) and elevated temperatures (35 and 40 degrees C). Chronic elevated temperatures reduce scutellar catalase activity most noticeably in the inbred lines W64A and R6-67, which express all three CAT isozymes (CAT-1, CAT-2, and CAT-3). The observed decline in catalase activity is primarily attributed to a decrease in the amount of CAT-2 isozyme, due to diminished levels of the Cat2 transcript. As CAT-2 activity levels are regulated by the trans-acting gene locus Car1, it is possible that the Car1 gene product is inhibited at the elevated temperatures. In maize lines null for CAT-2 or both CAT-2 and CAT-3, the relative levels of Cat1 transcript, although steady throughout the 10 days post-imbibition scutellar profile, are slightly higher with increasing temperatures. This might indicate that, in thermally stressed seedlings, the accumulation and/or stability of Cat1 mRNA might compensate for the lack of Cat2 transcript in a tissue where Cat2 mRNA normally accumulates during the developmental period examined. These observations, along with the drastic reduction in seed germination and seedling height at chronically elevated growth temperatures, suggest that developmental arrest, rather than oxidative stress, might be the cause for the observed results relative to Cat gene expression under such conditions."

Here, we investigate the cytotoxic effects of Plasma Conditioned Medium (PCM) in combination with DOX in prostate cancer cells from bone metastases (PC-3) as well as in non-malignant bone-cells. PCM was able to enhance the cytotoxic potential of DOX both in monolayer and in a 3D bioengineered model mimicking the bone matrix. The combined treatment of PCM + DOX resulted in a profound downregulation of the redox defenses (CAT1, SOD2, GPX1) and drug resistance genes (MRP1, MDR1, BCRP1), resulting in an enhanced uptake of DOX coupled to an overload of intracellular ROS. Besides, PCM improved the cytotoxic potential of DOX interfering on the migratory and clonogenic potential of PC-3 cells. Importantly, non-malignant bone cells were unaffected by the combination of PCM + DOX. Overall, these new findings may represent a new therapeutic approach for the management of bone metastatic prostate cancer in the future."
64,Journal of experimental botany ,17314079; ,"There is circumstantial evidence implicating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the highly ordered temporal and spatial regulation of expression of the Cat and Sod antioxidant genes during seed development and germination in maize. In order to understand and provide experimental data for the regulatory role of ROS, the expression patterns of the Cat1, Cat2, Cat3, GstI, Sod3, Sod4, and Sod4A genes, as well as catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity responses, were examined after treatments with ROS-generating xenobiotics in developing and germinated maize scutella. CAT and SOD activities increased at both stages in response to each xenobiotic examined in a dose-dependent and stage-specific manner. Individual Cat gene expression patterns were co-ordinated with isozyme patterns of enzymatic activity in scutella of developing seeds. This was not observed in germinated seeds where, although Cat1 expression was highly induced by ROS, there was not a similar increase of enzymatic CAT1 activity, suggesting the involvement of post-transcriptional regulation. Enhanced enzyme activities were synchronous with increases in steady-state transcript levels of specific Sod genes. The steady-state transcript level of GstI was elevated in all samples examined. Gene expression responses derived from this study along with similar results documented in previous reports were subjected to cluster analysis, revealing that ROS-generating compounds provoke similar effects in the expression patterns of the tested antioxidant genes. This could be attributable to common stress-related motifs present in the promoters of these genes."
65,Molecular and cellular biology ,7891685; ,"The expression of gluconeogenic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (encoded by the FBP1 gene) depends on the carbon source. Analysis of the FBP1 promoter revealed two upstream activating elements, UAS1FBP1 and UAS2FBP1, which confer carbon source-dependent regulation on a heterologous reporter gene. On glucose media neither element was activated, whereas after transfer to ethanol a 100-fold derepression was observed. This gene activation depended on the previously identified derepression genes CAT1 (SNF1) (encoding a protein kinase) and CAT3 (SNF4) (probably encoding a subunit of Cat1p [Snf1p]). Screening for mutations specifically involved in UAS1FBP1 derepression revealed the new recessive derepression mutation cat8. The cat8 mutants also failed to derepress UAS2FBP1, and these mutants were unable to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources. The CAT8 gene encodes a zinc cluster protein related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gal4p. Deletion of CAT8 caused a defect in glucose derepression which affected all key gluconeogenic enzymes. Derepression of glucose-repressible invertase and maltase was still normally regulated. A CAT8-lacZ promoter fusion revealed that the CAT8 gene itself is repressed by Cat4p (Mig1p). These results suggest that gluconeogenic genes are derepressed upon binding of Cat8p, whose synthesis depends on the release of Cat4p (Mig1p) from the CAT8 promoter. However, gluconeogenic promoters are still glucose repressed in cat4 mutants, which indicates that in addition to its transcription, the Cat8p protein needs further activation. The observation that multicopy expression of CAT8 reverses the inability of cat1 and cat3 mutants to grow on ethanol indicates that Cat8p might be the substrate of the Cat1p/Cat3p protein kinase."

In this study, an R2R3-type MYB gene Myb protein colourless 1 located on chromosome D (named TaMpc1-D4), was cloned from wheat. TaMpc1-D4-GFP protein was localized in the nucleus. Overexpression of TaMpc1-D4 reduced drought tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis lines, which was supported by the lower germination rate, the shorter root length, a higher level of O2- and malonaldehyde (MDA), the decreased proline content, and limited activities of peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). Furthermore, P5CS1, RD29A, RD29B, DREB2A, ABF3, CBF1, CBF2, CBF3, ERF1, POD1, SOD (Cu/Zn), and CAT1 genes related to the stress and antioxidant system were remarkably down-regulated in TaMpc1-D4 transgenic Arabidopsis lines under drought stress. Silencing TaMpc1-D4 expression in wheat enhanced the relative water content (RWC), the proline content, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and activated stress-related and antioxidant-related genes (DREB1, DREB3, ERF3, ERF4b, ABF, P5CS, POD, SOD (Fe), and CAT). Taken together, these results indicated that TaMpc1-D4 negatively modulated drought tolerance by regulating the capacity of the enzyme system and the expression of stress-related and antioxidant-related genes."

A total of 48 pigeon breeding families were randomly allocated to 8 groups of 6 replicates of one parental pigeon pair and 2 squabs. Samples of pigeon milk and duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were collected on d 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 14 post hatch. The results showed that levels of crude protein (8.93 to 15.56%) were highest in pigeon milk on an air-dry basis. Amino acid content in pigeon milk remained constant in the first 4 d, declined abruptly at d 6, then increased dramatically from d 8 to 14. There was a significant effect of interaction between age and intestinal segments on those amino acid transporters gene expression. mRNA abundance of ATB0'+, SNAT-2, LAT-4, rBAT, b0'+AT, EAAT-3 and PAT-1 was highest in the ileum; B0AT1, asc-1, and IMINO were predominate in the jejunum; and CAT-1 and y+LAT2 were greatest in the duodenum. Age-related changes of amino acid transporter mRNA was inconsistent. mRNA levels of SNAT-2, rBAT, y+LAT2, b0'+AT, and EAAT-3 ascended with age, whereas that of asc-1, CAT-1, and IMINO diminished significantly. Levels of B0AT1 and PAT-1 mRNA abundance were minimized at d 6. However, few correlations were found between pigeon milk amino acid and the amino acid transporter gene expressions in squab small intestine. Our findings provide a comprehensive elaboration on ontogeny of the amino acid transporter in post-hatch pigeon intestine."
68,Genomics ,11549322; ,"We report here the genomic structures of the genes encoding human calcium transport proteins CaT1 and CaT2, which belong to a recently identified class of highly selective calcium entry channels. The mRNA for CaT1 was expressed more abundantly than that for CaT2 in three major tissues involved in transcellular calcium transport, namely intestine, kidney, and placenta, as determined by quantitative PCR. The genes encoding CaT1 and CaT2, ECAC2 and ECAC1, respectively, are completely conserved in terms of exon size in the coding regions. They also share similar intron-exon structures with the genes encoding the closely related, nonselective cation channels VR1, VRL-1, OTRPC4 (also known as VR-OAC, Trp12, and VRL-2), and a hypothetical protein, VRL-3. We conclude that ECAC2 and ECAC1, which encode calcium selective channels, share a common ancestral gene with the genes encoding the related nonselective cation channels."
69,The European journal of neuroscience ,30218624; ,"Artificial light at night induces circadian disruptions and causes cognitive impairment and mood disorders; yet very little is known about the neural and molecular correlates of these effects in diurnal animals. We manipulated the night environment and examined cellular and molecular changes in hippocampus, the brain region involved in cognition and mood, of Indian house crows (Corvus splendens) exposed to 12 hr light (150 lux): 12 hr darkness (0 lux). Diurnal corvids are an ideal model species with cognitive abilities at par with mammals. Dim light (6 lux) at night (dLAN) altered daily activity:rest pattern, reduced sleep, and induced depressive-like responses (decreased eating and self-grooming, self-mutilation, and reduced novel object exploration); return to an absolute dark night reversed these negative effects. dLAN suppressed nocturnal melatonin levels; however, diurnal corticosterone levels were unaffected. Concomitant reduction of immunoreactivity for DCX and BDNF suggested dLAN-induced suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis and compromised neuronal health. dLAN also negatively influenced hippocampal expression of genes associated with depressive-like responses (bdnf, il-1β, tnfr1, nr4a2), but not of those associated with neuronal plasticity (egr1, creb, syngap, syn2, grin2a, grin2b), cellular oxidative stress (gst, sod3, cat1) and neuronal death (caspase2, caspase3, foxo3). Furthermore, we envisaged the role of BDNF and showed epigenetic modification of bdnf gene by decreased histone H3 acetylation and increased hdac4 expression under dLAN. These results demonstrate transcriptional and epigenetic bases of dLAN-induced negative effects in diurnal crows, and provide insights into the risks of exposure to illuminated nights to animals including humans in an urban setting."
70,mSphere ,34986316; ,"Previously, 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin was described to protect Aspergillus fumigatus against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), thereby protecting this opportunistic human pathogen from reactive oxygen species generated by the immune system. This was based on the finding that the ATCC 46645 mutant with mutations in the pksP gene of the DHN-melanin synthesis pathway showed increased sensitivity to reactive oxygen species compared to the wild type. Here, it is shown that deletion of the pksP gene in A. fumigatus strain CEA10 did not affect sensitivity for H2O2 and superoxide in a plate stress assay. In addition, direct exposure of the dormant white conidia of the pksP deletion strains to H2O2 did not result in increased sensitivity. Moreover, complementation of the ATCC 46645 pksP mutant strain with the wild-type pksP gene did result in pigmented conidia but did not rescue the H2O2-sensitive phenotype observed in the plate stress assay. Genome sequencing of the ATCC 46645 pksP mutant strain and its complemented strain revealed a mutation in the cat1 gene, likely due to the UV mutagenesis procedure used previously, which could explain the increased sensitivity toward H2O2. In summary, DHN-melanin is not involved in protection against H2O2 or superoxide and, thus, has no role in survival of conidia when attacked by these reactive oxygen species. IMPORTANCE Opportunistic pathogens like Aspergillus fumigatus have strategies to protect themselves against reactive oxygen species like hydrogen peroxides and superoxides that are produced by immune cells. DHN-melanin is the green pigment on conidia of Aspergillus fumigatus and more than 2 decades ago was reported to protect conidia against hydrogen peroxide. Here, we correct this misinterpretation by showing that DHN-melanin actually is not involved in protection of conidia against hydrogen peroxide. We show that UV mutagenesis that was previously used to select a pksP mutant generated many more genome-wide mutations. We discovered that a mutation in the mycelial catalase gene cat1 could explain the observed phenotype of increased hydrogen peroxide sensitivity. Our work shows that UV mutagenesis is not the preferred methodology to be used for generating mutants. It requires genome sequencing with single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis as well as additional validations to discard unwanted and confirm correct phenotypes."

One hundred and eighty laying Japanese quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) were fed a basal diet or basal diet supplemented with either 2.5 or 5 g of taurine per kg of diet, and reared at either 22 ± 2 °C for 24 h/d (thermoneutral, TN) or 34 ± 2 °C for 8 h/d (HS) for 12 weeks. The quails reared under HS consumed less feed, produced less egg, and had lower dry matter, organic matter and crude protein apparent digestibilities compared with the quails reared under the TN condition (P = 0.001). However, increasing taurine concentrations in the diet improved feed intake and egg production (P = 0.001), but also the apparent digestibilities (P ≤ 0.027) in quails reared under HS. The greater doses (5 g/kg) of taurine resulted in more responses. The quails reared under HS had greater serum and liver MDA concentrations (P = 0.0001) which decreased with dietary taurine supplementations, particularly greater doses. The gene expressions of ileal PEPT1, EAAT3, CAT1, CAT2, SGLT1, SGLT5, GLUT2, and GLUT5 decreased under HS conditions (P = 0.001). However, supplementing taurine, in a dose-dependent fashion, to the diet of quails reared under HS resulted in increases in the gene expressions of the transporters (P < 0.05) except for CAT1. The results of the present work showed that taurine supplementation, particularly with greater doses (5 g/kg), to the diet of laying quails kept under HS acts as alleviating negative effects of HS, resulting in improvements in productive performance and nutrient digestion, and also upregulation of ileal nutrient transporters."

However, the molecular details of calcium transport across the enterocyte are not fully defined. Recently, two novel epithelial calcium channels (CaT1/ECaC2 and ECaC1/CaT2) have been cloned and suggested to be important in regulating intestinal calcium absorption.

Here, we identified one gene, GhMPK6, encoding an MAPK protein in cotton. GFP fluorescence assay demonstrated that GhMAPK6 is a cytoplasm localized protein. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that mRNA accumulation of GhMPK6 was significantly promoted by abscisic acid (ABA). Overexpression of GhMPK6 gene in the T-DNA insertion mutant atmkk1 (SALK_015914) conferred a wild-type phenotype to the transgenic plants in response to ABA. Under ABA treatment, cotyledon greening/expansion in GhMPK6 transgenic lines and wild type was significantly inhibited, whereas the atmkk1 mutant showed a relatively high cotyledon greening/expansion ratio. Furthermore, CAT1 expression and H(2)O(2) levels in leaves of GhMPK6 transgenic lines and wild type were remarkably higher than those of atmkk1 mutant with ABA treatment. Collectively, our results suggested that GhMPK6 may play an important role in ABA-induced CAT1 expression and H(2)O(2) production."

This work analyzed the mechanisms involved in drought stress alleviation exerted by Rhizobium leguminosarum strains in wheat plants under water shortage conditions. Two (LBM1210 and LET4910) of the four R. leguminosarum strains significantly improved the growth parameters (fresh and dry aerial weight, FW and DW, respectively), chlorophyll content, and relative water content (RWC) compared to a non-inoculated control under water stress, providing values similar to or even higher for FW (+4%) and RWC (+2.3%) than the non-inoculated and non-stressed control. Some other biochemical parameters and gene expression explain the observed drought stress alleviation, namely the reduction of MDA, H2O2 (stronger when inoculating with LET4910), and ABA content (stronger when inoculating with LBM1210). In agreement with these results, inoculation with LET4910 downregulated DREB2 and CAT1 genes in plants under water deficiency and upregulated the CYP707A1 gene, while inoculation with LBM1210 strongly upregulated the CYP707A1 gene, which encodes an ABA catabolic enzyme. Conversely, from our results, ethylene metabolism did not seem to be involved in the alleviation of drought stress exerted by the two strains, as the expression of the CTR1 gene was very similar in all treatments and controls. The obtained results regarding the effect of the analyzed strains in alleviating drought stress are very relevant in the present situation of climate change, which negatively influences agricultural production."
76,Plant molecular biology ,9037166; ,"Three cDNA clones (cat1, cat2, cat3) for catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) were isolated from a cDNA library of pumpkin (Cucurbita sp.) cotyledons. In northern blotting using the cDNA-specific probe, the cat1 mRNA levels were high in seeds and early seedlings of pumpkin. The expression pattern of cat1 was similar to that of malate synthase, a characteristic enzyme of glyoxysomes. These data suggest that cat1 might encode a catalase associated with glyoxysomal functions. Furthermore, immunocytochemical analysis using cat1-specific anti-peptide antibody directly showed that cat1 encoding catalase is located in glyoxysomes. The cat2 mRNA was present at high levels in green cotyledons, mature leaf, stem and green hypocotyl of light-grown pumpkin plant, and correlated with chlorophyll content in the tissues. The tissue-specific expression of cat2 had a strong resemblance to that of glycolate oxidase, a characteristic enzyme of leaf peroxisomes. During germination of pumpkin seeds, cat2 mRNA levels increased in response to light, although the increase in cat2 mRNA by light was less than that of glycolate oxidase. cat3 mRNA was abundant in green cotyledons, etiolated cotyledons, green hypocotyl and root, but not in young leaf. cat3 mRNA expression was not dependent on light, but was constitutive in mature tissues. Interestingly, cat1 mRNA levels increased during senescence of pumpkin cotyledons, whereas cat2 and cat3 mRNAs disappeared during senescence, suggesting that cat1 encoding catalase may be involved in the senescence process. Thus, in pumpkin, three catalase genes are differentially regulated and may exhibit different functions."
77,Endocrinology ,12933662; ,"We examined the expression of calcium transporter 1 (CaT1) and epithelial calcium channel (ECaC) mRNA in the duodenum and kidney of mice.

In contrast, renal CaT1 and ECaC mRNA expression was equal until weaning when ECaC mRNA is induced and CaT1 mRNA levels fall 70%. Long- and short-term adaptation to changes in dietary calcium (Ca) level and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)] injection strongly regulated duodenal calbindin D(9k) and CaT1 mRNA. Following a single dose of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), induction of CaT1 mRNA occurred rapidly (within 3 h, peak at 6 h of 9.6 +/- 0.8-fold) and preceded the induction of intestinal Ca absorption (significantly increased at 6 h, peak at 9 h). Neither renal CaT1 nor ECaC mRNA were strongly regulated by dietary calcium level or 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) injection. Our data indicate that CaT1 and ECaC mRNA levels are differentially regulated by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in kidney and intestine and that there may be a specialized role for CaT1 in kidney in fetal and neonatal development. The rapid induction of intestinal CaT1 mRNA expression by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), and the marked induction at weaning, suggest that CaT1 is critical for 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated intestinal Ca absorption."
78,Free radical biology & medicine ,9214588; ,"The three maize catalase genes respond differentially to light signals. Expression of Cat1 is light independent while expression of Cat2 and Cat3 is light responsive. Upon exposure to light there is rapid accumulation of CAT-2 protein in leaves, due to both increased transcript accumulation and increased translation of the Cat2 message. Short UV light pulses also cause a strong transient induction of Cat2 gene expression, while long term exposure to UV does not affect the rate of Cat2 transcription. The Cat3 gene of maize exhibits a transcriptionally regulated circadian rhythm. The induction of the Cat3 circadian expression in etiolated leaves is probably regulated by a very low fluence phytochrome response; the involvement of a blue light/UV-A and a UV-B photoreceptor is also possible. Regulatory elements located on the Cat3 promoter have recently been identified and their significance in the complex light response of the gene is being investigated. Possible physiological role(s) of the light responding maize catalases Cat2 and Cat3 are discussed."

To determine the importance of catalase during the invasion process of M. anisopliae, we isolated the cat1 gene. cat1 cDNA expression in Escherichia coli and the subsequent purification of the protein confirmed that the cat1 gene codes for a monofunctional catalase. Expression analysis of this gene by RT-PCR from RNA isolated from fungus grown in liquid cultures showed a decrease in the expression level of the cat1 gene during germination and an increase during mycelium growth. The expression of this gene in the fungus during the infection process of the larvae of Plutella xylostella also showed a significant increase during invasive growth. Transgenic strains overexpressing the cat1 gene had twice the catalase activity of the wild-type strain. This increase in catalase activity was accompanied by a higher level of resistance to exogenous hydrogen peroxide and a reduction in the germination time. This improvement was also observed during the infection of P. xylostella larvae.

They inhibit gene expression by associating with 3'-Untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and are thought to regulate a large proportion of protein coding genes. However, it is becoming apparent that miRNA activity is not necessarily always determined by its expression in the cell. MiRNA activity can be affected by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). For example, the RNA-binding protein HuR associates with the 3'UTR of the CAT1 mRNA after stress, counteracting the effect of miR-122. Second, we found that the expression of an RNA-binding protein called Dead end (Dnd1) prohibits the function of several miRNAs by blocking the accessibility of target mRNAs.(2) Dnd1 function is essential for proper development of primordial germ cells (PGCs) in zebrafish and mammals, indicating a crucial role for RBP/miRNA interplay on 3'UTRs of mRNAs in developmental decisions.

The expression of the gene is mediated via a TATA-less promoter. In the present study we show that an Sp1 (specificity protein 1)-binding site within a GC-rich region of the Cat-1 gene controls its basal expression and is important for induction of the gene during the UPR (unfolded protein response). We have shown previously that induction of Cat-1 gene expression during the UPR requires phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha (eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha) by PERK (protein-kinase-receptor-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase), one of the signalling pathways activated during the UPR. This leads to increased translation of the transcription factor ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4). We also show that a second signalling pathway is required for sustained transcriptional induction of the Cat-1 gene during the UPR, namely activation of IRE1 (inositol-requiring enzyme 1) leading to alternative splicing of the mRNA for the transcription factor XBP1 (X-box-binding protein 1). The resulting XBP1s (spliced XBP1) can bind to an ERSE (endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-response-element), ERSE-II-like, that was identified within the Cat-1 promoter. Surprisingly, eIF2alpha phosphorylation is required for accumulation of XBP1s. We propose that the signalling via phosphorylated eIF2alpha is required for maximum induction of Cat-1 transcription during the UPR by inducing the accumulation of both ATF4 and XBP1s."

Salt stress led to a lower chlorophyll content, a reduced photosynthetic activity, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents, and decreased photosystem II (PSII) activity. The application of exogenous MT to green bean seedlings under salt stress improved photosynthetic activity and alleviated the oxidative damages by enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes.

Here, an interaction between Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) triple gene block protein 1 (TGBp1; p26) and tomato catalase 1 (CAT1), a crucial enzyme in the decomposition of toxic hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), was identified using the yeast two-hybrid assay, and confirmed via an in vitro pull-down assay and bimolecular fluorescent complementation (BiFC) in planta. Each protein was independently localized within loci in the cytoplasm and nuclei, sites at which their interaction had been visualized by BiFC. Following PepMV inoculation, CAT mRNA and protein levels in leaves were unaltered at 0, 3 and 6 days (locally) and 8 days (systemically) post-inoculation; however, leaf extracts from the last two time points contained increased CAT activity and lower H₂O₂ evels. Overexpression of PepMV p26 in vitro and in planta conferred the same effect, suggesting an additional involvement of TGBp1 in potexvirus pathogenesis. The accumulation of PepMV genomic and subgenomic RNAs and the expression of viral coat protein in noninoculated (systemic) leaves were reduced significantly in CAT-silenced plants. It is postulated that, during PepMV infection, a p26-CAT1 interaction increases H₂O₂ cavenging, thus acting as a negative regulator of plant defence mechanisms to promote PepMV infections."
88,Infection and immunity ,9573075; ,"Catalase plays a key role as an antioxidant, protecting aerobic organisms from the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide, and in some cases has been postulated to be a virulence factor. To help elucidate the function of catalase in Candida albicans, a single C. albicans-derived catalase gene, designated CAT1, was isolated and cloned. Degenerate PCR primers based on highly conserved areas of other fungal catalase genes were used to amplify a 411-bp product from genomic DNA of C. albicans ATCC 10261. By using this product as a probe, catalase clones were isolated from genomic libraries of C. albicans. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame encoding a protein of 487 amino acid residues. Construction of a CAT1-deficient mutant was achieved by using the Ura-blaster technique for sequential disruption of multiple alleles by integrative transformation using URA3 as a selectable marker. Resulting mutants exhibited normal morphology and comparable growth rates of both yeast and mycelial forms. Enzymatic analysis revealed an abundance of catalase in the wild-type strain but decreasing catalase activity in heterozygous mutants and no detectable catalase in a homozygous null mutant. In vitro assays showed the mutant strains to be more sensitive to damage by both neutrophils and concentrations of exogenous peroxide that were sublethal for the parental strain. Compared to the parental strain, the homozygous null mutant strain was far less virulent for mice in an intravenous infection model of disseminated candidiasis. Definitive linkage of CAT1 with virulence would require restoration of activity by reintroduction of the gene into mutants. However, initial results in mice, taken together with the enhanced susceptibility of catalase-deficient hyphae to damage by human neutrophils, suggest that catalase may enhance the pathogenicity of C. albicans."
89,Journal of integrative plant biology ,19017119; ,"In Arabidopsis, catalase (CAT) genes encode a small family of proteins including CAT1, CAT2 and CAT3, which catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and play an important role in controlling homeostasis of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we analyze the expression profiles and activities of three catalases under different treatments including drought, cold, oxidative stresses, abscisic acid and salicylic acid in Arabidopsis. Our results reveal that CAT1 is an important player in the removal of H2O2 generated under various environmental stresses. CAT2 and CAT3 are major H2O2 scavengers that contribute to ROS homeostasis in light or darkness, respectively. In addition, CAT2 is activated by cold and drought stresses and CAT3 is mainly enhanced by abscisic acid and oxidative treatments as well as at the senescence stage. These results, together with previous data, suggest that the network of transcriptional control explains how CATs and other scavenger enzymes such as peroxidase and superoxide dismutase may be coordinately regulated during development, but differentially expressed in response to different stresses for controlling ROS homeostasis."
90,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology ,36738937; ,"Environmental stresses affect the yield and productivity of Brassica crops. Catalases are important antioxidant enzymes involved in reducing excess hydrogen peroxide produced by environmental stresses. In the present study, nine and seven CAT family members in two oilseed Brassica species (B. juncea and B. rapa) were identified with complete characterization based on gene and protein structure. Phylogenetic classification categorized CAT proteins into three classes and differentiated the monocot and dicot-specific CAT proteins. Further, the gene and protein characterizations revealed a high degree of conservation across the CAT family members. Differences were observed in the CAT-HEME binding affinity in CAT1, CAT2, and CAT3 isozymes, which could suggest their differential enzyme activities in different conditions. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction with other antioxidant proteins suggested their coordinated role in ROS scavenging mechanisms. Notably, the differential gene expression of BjuCATs and BraCATs and CAT enzyme activities suggested their crucial roles in major abiotic stresses faced by Brassica species. Promoter analysis in BjuCATs and BraCATs suggested the presence of abiotic-stress responsive cis-regulatory elements. Gene regulatory network analysis suggested miRNA and TF mediated stress response in BjuCATs and BraCATs. CAT family screening and characterization in Brassica sp. has established a basic ground for further functional validation in abiotic and heavy-metal stresses which can help in developing stress tolerant crops."
91,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland) ",36290758; ,"Arabidopsis mitochondrial-localized heat shock protein 70-1 (mtHSC70-1) modulates vegetative growth by assisting mitochondrial complex IV assembly and maintaining reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. In addition, mtHSC70-1 affects embryo development, and this effect is mediated by auxin. However, whether mtHSC70-1 regulates vegetative growth through auxin and knowledge of the link between ROS homeostasis and auxin distribution remain unclear. Here, we found that mtHSC70-1 knockout seedlings (mthsc70-1a) displayed shortened roots, decreased fresh root weight and lateral root number, increased root width and abnormal root morphology. The introduction of the mtHSC70-1 gene into mthsc70-1a restored the growth and development of roots to the level of the wild type. However, sugar and auxin supplementation could not help the mutant roots restore to normal. Moreover, mthsc70-1a seedlings showed a decrease in meristem length and activity, auxin transport carrier (PINs and AUX1) and auxin abundances in root tips. The application of exogenous reducing agents upregulated the levels of PINs in the mutant roots. The introduction of antioxidant enzyme genes (MSD1 or CAT1) into the mthsc70-1a mutant rescued the PIN and local auxin abundances and root growth and development. Taken together, our data suggest that mtHSC70-1 regulates polar auxin transport through ROS homeostasis in Arabidopsis roots."
92,Applied and environmental microbiology ,23603675; ,"Psychrobacter arcticus strain 273-4, an isolate from a Siberian permafrost core, is capable of forming biofilms when grown in minimal medium under laboratory conditions. Biofilms form at 4 to 22°C when acetate is supplied as the lone carbon source and with 1 to 7% sea salt. P. arcticus is also capable of colonizing quartz sand. Transposon mutagenesis identified a gene important for biofilm formation by P. arcticus. Four transposon mutants were mapped to a 20.1-kbp gene, which is predicted to encode a protein of 6,715 amino acids (Psyc_1601). We refer to this open reading frame as cat1, for cold attachment gene 1. The cat1 mutants are unable to form biofilms at levels equivalent to that of the wild type, and there is no impact on the planktonic growth characteristics of the strains, indicating a specific role in biofilm formation. Through time course studies of the static microtiter plate assay, we determined that cat1 mutants are unable to form biofilms equivalent to that of the wild type under all conditions tested. In flow cell experiments, cat1 mutants initially are unable to attach to the surface. Over time, however, they form microcolonies, an architecture very different from that produced by wild-type biofilms. Our results demonstrate that Cat1 is involved in the initial stages of bacterial attachment to surfaces."

94,Journal of hazardous materials ,32818834; ,"Soilless culture experiments with tobacco were conducted to explore how the signal molecule H2S (0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 μM) alleviated the toxicity of Cd2+ (50 mg/L). The results suggested that photosynthesis was enhanced as H2S improved the tobacco ΦPSII, ETR, Photo, Cond, and Tr, and that by increasing the NPQ, it consumed considerable amount of energy to enhance plant resistances during Cd2+ exposure. Furthermore, H2S increased the gene transcription of NtSOD3, NtPOD1, and CAT1, to enhance antioxidant enzyme activity, which reduces the generation of the reactive oxygen protective membrane integrity. Additionally, H2S increased the gene expression of the tobacco PC genes, Pr2 and Pr8 promoted the formation of the Cd2+ complexes and transportation to the vacuole, resulting in improved Cd-ATPase gene expression, away from organelles, to alleviate the Cd2+ poison. Furthermore, H2S regulated the relative absorption of K+ and Ca2+, which antagonized the Cd2+, and reduced its transportation to the aboveground plant material. Finally, the expression level of CaM increased with the application of H2S, and was highly correlated with the fitted results of a variety of resistance indicators, thereby indicating that H2S regulatory resistance mechanisms might be associated with Ca2+ signal transduction."

The epithelial calcium transporter, known as ECAC2 or CAT1, the product of the TRPV6 gene expressed in proximal intestinal enterocytes, is the first step in calcium absorption and studies in mice have shown that its expression is Vitamin D-dependent. In contrast in man, we showed that duodenal TRPV6 mRNA expression was independent of blood 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), although in Caco-2 cells, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-dependent changes have been demonstrated. We sought to explain these findings. A consensus Vitamin D response element in the mouse gene is absent in the human gene. We re-analysed our duodenal expression data according to a CDX2-site polymorphism in the VDR promoter. Mean TRPV6 expression was the same, but there was evidence of different responsiveness to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). In the GG genotype group, but not the AG, duodenal TRPV6 expression increased with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). We postulate that lower levels of expression of VDR in the GG group produce greater sensitivity to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)."
96,PloS one ,23326325; ,"Abscisic acid (ABA) is a key component of the signaling system that integrates plant adaptive responses to abiotic stress. Overexpression of Arabidopsis molybdenum cofactor sulfurase gene (LOS5) in maize markedly enhanced the expression of ZmAO and aldehyde oxidase (AO) activity, leading to ABA accumulation and increased drought tolerance. Transgenic maize (Zea mays L.) exhibited the expected reductions in stomatal aperture, which led to decreased water loss and maintenance of higher relative water content (RWC) and leaf water potential. Also, transgenic maize subjected to drought treatment exhibited lower leaf wilting, electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde (MDA) and H(2)O(2) content, and higher activities of antioxidative enzymes and proline content compared to wild-type (WT) maize. Moreover, overexpression of LOS5 enhanced the expression of stress-regulated genes such as Rad 17, NCED1, CAT1, and ZmP5CS1 under drought stress conditions, and increased root system development and biomass yield after re-watering. The increased drought tolerance in transgenic plants was associated with ABA accumulation via activated AO and expression of stress-related gene via ABA induction, which sequentially induced a set of favorable stress-related physiological and biochemical responses."
97,FEBS letters ,7750534; ,"Transcription of the vacuolar aminopeptidase yscI-encoding gene (APE1) is regulated by the carbon source used for yeast growth, responding to carbon catabolite repression. By Northern blot analyses, we determined the kinetics of glucose repression in growth-shift experiments. When added to induced cells, glucose leads to the disappearance of hybridizable aminopeptidase yscI RNA sequences within 30 min. However, the amount of inmunoreactive protein, once induced, is not affected by the addition of glucose. By deletion analysis of the fusion gene APE1-lacZ we have identified a number of strong regulatory regions in the APE1 promoter. Consensus sequences for the binding of yAP1 and the HAP2/HAP3/HAP4 complex are contained in those regions. Control of the APE1 gene expression is not mediated by the HXK2 regulatory gene, but a strain bearing a deletion in the CAT1 gene can not derepress APE1 transcription to wild-type levels."
98,Molecular genetics and genomics : MGG ,18219492; ,"The Tsc/Rheb signaling pathway plays critical roles in the control of growth and cell cycle. Studies in fission yeast have also implicated its importance in the regulation of amino acid uptake. Disruption of tsc2+, one of the tsc+ genes, has been shown to result in decreased arginine uptake and resistance to canavanine. A similar effect is also seen with other basic amino acids. We have identified a permease responsible for the uptake of basic amino acids by genetic complementation and disruption. SPAC869.11 (termed Cat1 for cationic amino acid transporter) contains 12 predicted transmembrane domains and its overexpression in wild type fission yeast leads to the increased uptake of basic amino acids and sensitivity to canavanine. Disruption of cat1+ in the deltatsc2 background interfered with the suppression of the canavanine-resistant phenotype of Atsc2 mutants by a dominant negative Rheb. In deltatsc2 mutant strains, the amount of Cat1 was not altered, but instead was mislocalized. This mislocalization was suppressed by the expression of dominant negative Rheb. In addition, we found that the loss of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Pub1, also restores proper localization. These results provide a crucial link between Tsc/Rheb signaling and the regulation of the basic amino acid permease in fission yeast."
99,Functional plant biology : FPB ,31196377; ,"Plant annexins are proteins with multiple functions and roles in plant development and responses to abiotic stresses. We report here the functional analysis of the TdAnn12 annexin protein isolated from Triticum durum Desf. We have previously shown that TdAnn12 expression is highly induced by different abiotic stresses. In the present study, to investigate the physiological and biochemical stress-induced responses, we overexpressed TdAnn12 in tobacco. We demonstrate that transgenic tobacco plants expressing TdAnn12 exhibited enhanced tolerance to salt, osmotic stress and H2O2 at the seedling stage. Under greenhouse conditions, these plants showed tolerance to drought and salt stresses. Moreover, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), higher chlorophyll content, lower lipid peroxidation levels and increased antioxidant activities (peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase) were observed. Finally, accumulation of TdAnn12 in tobacco positively affects the regulation of some stress-related genes (MnSOD, APX1, CAT1, P5CS, NHX1, SOS1 and DREB1A). TdAnn12 interacts directly or indirectly with stress-related genes that could stimulate an adaptive potential to gain tolerance which is not present in non-transgenic (NT) plants. Our results clearly show that overexpression of TdAnn12 in transgenic tobacco improves stress tolerance through the removal of ROS."
