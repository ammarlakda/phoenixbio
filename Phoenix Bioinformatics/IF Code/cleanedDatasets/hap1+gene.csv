0,Nature ,35614220; ,"Mitochondria are epicentres of eukaryotic metabolism and bioenergetics. Pioneering efforts in recent decades have established the core protein componentry of these organelles1 and have linked their dysfunction to more than 150 distinct disorders2,3. Still, hundreds of mitochondrial proteins lack clear functions4, and the underlying genetic basis for approximately 40% of mitochondrial disorders remains unresolved5. Here, to establish a more complete functional compendium of human mitochondrial proteins, we profiled more than 200 CRISPR-mediated HAP1 cell knockout lines using mass spectrometry-based multiomics analyses. This effort generated approximately 8.3 million distinct biomolecule measurements, providing a deep survey of the cellular responses to mitochondrial perturbations and laying a foundation for mechanistic investigations into protein function. Guided by these data, we discovered that PIGY upstream open reading frame (PYURF) is an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase chaperone that supports both complex I assembly and coenzyme Q biosynthesis and is disrupted in a previously unresolved multisystemic mitochondrial disorder. We further linked the putative zinc transporter SLC30A9 to mitochondrial ribosomes and OxPhos integrity and established RAB5IF as the second gene harbouring pathogenic variants that cause cerebrofaciothoracic dysplasia. Our data, which can be explored through the interactive online MITOMICS.app resource, suggest biological roles for many other orphan mitochondrial proteins that still lack robust functional characterization and define a rich cell signature of mitochondrial dysfunction that can support the genetic diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases."

3,Genes ,32679672; ,"Ergosterol is an essential component of fungal cell membranes that determines the fluidity, permeability and activity of membrane-associated proteins. Ergosterol biosynthesis is a complex and highly energy-consuming pathway that involves the participation of many enzymes. Deficiencies in sterol biosynthesis cause pleiotropic defects that limit cellular proliferation and adaptation to stress. Thereby, fungal ergosterol levels are tightly controlled by the bioavailability of particular metabolites (e.g., sterols, oxygen and iron) and environmental conditions. The regulation of ergosterol synthesis is achieved by overlapping mechanisms that include transcriptional expression, feedback inhibition of enzymes and changes in their subcellular localization. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the sterol regulatory element (SRE)-binding proteins Upc2 and Ecm22, the heme-binding protein Hap1 and the repressor factors Rox1 and Mot3 coordinate ergosterol biosynthesis (ERG) gene expression. Here, we summarize the sterol biosynthesis, transport and detoxification systems of S. cerevisiae, as well as its adaptive response to sterol depletion, low oxygen, hyperosmotic stress and iron deficiency. Because of the large number of ERG genes and the crosstalk between different environmental signals and pathways, many aspects of ergosterol regulation are still unknown. The study of sterol metabolism and its regulation is highly relevant due to its wide applications in antifungal treatments, as well as in food and pharmaceutical industries."
4,FEBS letters ,35490374; ,"Mitochondrial activity adapts to cellular energetic and metabolic demands; its dysfunction is a hallmark of ageing and many human diseases. The evolutionarily conserved translation elongation factor eIF5A is involved in maintaining mitochondrial function. In humans, eIF5A is encoded by two highly homologous but differentially expressed genes; in yeast, these are TIF51A and TIF51B. We show that yeast transcription factor Hap1 constitutively binds to the TIF51A promoter to activate its expression under respiration, but represses its expression under nonrespiration conditions by recruiting the corepressor Tup1. Hap1 indirectly regulates TIF51B expression by binding to and activating the TIF51B repressor genes ROX1 and MOT3 under respiration and repressing them under nonrespiration. Thus, the levels of eIF5A isoforms are adapted to the mitochondrial functional status."
5,Biochemical and biophysical research communications ,17706600; ,"The yeast transcriptional regulator Hap1 promotes both transcriptional activation and repression. Previous studies have shown that Hap1 binds to the promoter of its own gene and represses its transcription. In this report, we identified the DNA site that allows Hap1-binding with high affinity. This Hap1-binding site contains only one CGG triplet and is distinct from the typical Hap1-binding upstream activation sequences (UASs) mediating transcriptional activation. Furthermore, at the HAP1 promoter, Ssa is bound to DNA with Hap1, whereas Hsp90 is not bound. Intriguingly, we found that histone deacetylases, including Rpd3, Hda1, Sin3 and Hos1, are not required for the repression of the HAP1 gene by Hap1. Rather, they are required for transcriptional activation of the HAP1 promoter, and this requirement is dependent on the HAP1 basal promoter. These results reveal a complex mechanism of transcriptional regulation at the HAP1 promoter, involving multiple DNA elements and regulatory proteins."

8,Nature metabolism ,32694731; ,"The de novo synthesis of fatty acids has emerged as a therapeutic target for various diseases, including cancer. Because cancer cells are intrinsically buffered to combat metabolic stress, it is important to understand how cells may adapt to the loss of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. Here, we use pooled genome-wide CRISPR screens to systematically map genetic interactions (GIs) in human HAP1 cells carrying a loss-of-function mutation in fatty acid synthase (FASN), whose product catalyses the formation of long-chain fatty acids. FASN-mutant cells show a strong dependence on lipid uptake that is reflected in negative GIs with genes involved in the LDL receptor pathway, vesicle trafficking and protein glycosylation. Further support for these functional relationships is derived from additional GI screens in query cell lines deficient in other genes involved in lipid metabolism, including LDLR, SREBF1, SREBF2 and ACACA. Our GI profiles also identify a potential role for the previously uncharacterized gene C12orf49 (which we call LUR1) in regulation of exogenous lipid uptake through modulation of SREBF2 signalling in response to lipid starvation. Overall, our data highlight the genetic determinants underlying the cellular adaptation associated with loss of de novo fatty acid synthesis and demonstrate the power of systematic GI mapping for uncovering metabolic buffering mechanisms in human cells."
9,Molecular cytogenetics ,36289492; ,"HAP1, a near-haploid human leukemic cancer cell line is often used in combination with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology for genetic screens. HAP1 carries the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) and an additional ~ 30 Mb fragment of chromosome 15 inserted into chromosome 19. The potential use of an in vitro cell line as a model system in biomedical research studies depends on its ability to maintain genome stability. Being a cancer cell line with a near-haploid genome, HAP1 is prone to genetic instability, which is further compounded by its tendency to diploidise in culture spontaneously. Moreover, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing coupled with prolonged in-vitro cell culturing has the potential to induce unintended 'off-target' cytogenetic mutations. To gain an insight into chromosomal instability (CIN) and karyotype heterogeneity, 19 HAP1 cell lines were cytogenetically characterised, 17 of which were near-haploids and two double-haploids, using multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridisation (M-FISH), at single cell resolution. We focused on novel numerical (N) and structural (S) CIN and discussed the potential causal factors for the observed instability. For each cell line we examined its ploidy, gene editing status and its length of in-vitro cell culturing."
10,Biology open ,33184093; ,"The near-haploid human cell line HAP1 recently became a popular subject for CRISPR/Cas9 editing, since only one allele requires modification. Through the gene-editing service at Horizon Discovery, there are at present more than 7500 edited cell lines available and the number continuously increases. The haploid nature of HAP1 is unstable as cultures become diploid with time. Here, we demonstrated some fundamental differences between haploid and diploid HAP1 cells, hence underlining the need for taking control over ploidy status in HAP1 cultures prior to phenotyping. Consequently, we optimized a procedure to determine the ploidy of HAP1 by flow cytometry in order to obtain diploid cultures and avoid ploidy status as an interfering variable in experiments. Furthermore, in order to facilitate this quality control, we validated a size-based cell sorting procedure to obtain the diploid culture more rapidly. Hence, we provide here two streamlined protocols for quality controlling the ploidy of HAP1 cells and document their validity and necessity.This article has an associated First Person interview with the co-first authors of the paper."
11,Blood ,30819925; ,"l-Asparaginase (l-ASNase) is a strategic component of treatment protocols for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It causes asparagine deficit, resulting in protein synthesis inhibition and subsequent leukemic cell death and ALL remission. However, patients often relapse because of the development of resistance, but the underlying mechanism of ALL cell resistance to l-asparaginase remains unknown. Through unbiased genome-wide RNA interference screening, we identified huntingtin associated protein 1 (HAP1) as an ALL biomarker for l-asparaginase resistance. Knocking down HAP1 induces l-asparaginase resistance. HAP1 interacts with huntingtin and the intracellular Ca2+ channel, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor to form a ternary complex that mediates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ release upon stimulation with inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate3 Loss of HAP1 prevents the formation of the ternary complex and thus l-asparaginase-mediated ER Ca2+ release. HAP1 loss also inhibits external Ca2+ entry, blocking an excessive rise in [Ca2+]i, and reduces activation of the Ca2+-dependent calpain-1, Bid, and caspase-3 and caspase-12, leading to reduced number of apoptotic cells. These findings indicate that HAP1 loss prevents l-asparaginase-induced apoptosis through downregulation of the Ca2+-mediated calpain-1-Bid-caspase-3/12 apoptotic pathway. Treatment with BAPTA-AM [1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester)] reverses the l-asparaginase apoptotic effect in control cells, supporting a link between l-asparaginase-induced [Ca2+]i increase and apoptotic cell death. Consistent with these findings, ALL patient leukemic cells with lower HAP1 levels showed resistance to l-asparaginase, indicating the clinical relevance of HAP1 loss in the development of l-asparaginase resistance, and pointing to HAP1 as a functional l-asparaginase resistance biomarker that may be used for the design of effective treatment of l-asparaginase-resistant ALL."
12,The EMBO journal ,2844525; ,"Control of expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTT1 (catalase T) gene by the HAP1 (CYP1) gene, a mediator of heme control of mitochondrial cytochromes, was studied. Expression of a CTT1-lacZ fusion in a hap1 mutant showed that the CTT1 promoter is under HAP1 control. As demonstrated by a gel retardation assay, the HAP1 protein binds to a heme control region of the CTT1 gene. This binding in vitro is stimulated by hemin. The HAP1-binding sequence was localized by using DNA fragments spanning different regions, by DNase I footprinting and by methylation interference of DNA-protein binding. The binding site was compared to the HAP1-binding sequences previously characterized in detail (UAS1CYC1, UASCYC7). There is strikingly little similarity between the three sequences, which have only four of those 23 bp in common which are protected from DNase I digestion. However, the pattern of major and minor groove contacts in the complex is quite similar in all three cases. The results obtained show that there is true co-ordinate control of expression of mitochondrial cytochromes and at least some extra-mitochondrial hemoproteins. Heme acts as a metabolic signal in this coordination, which is mediated by the HAP1 protein."
13,Molecular and cellular biology ,1656218; ,"Mitochondrial biogenesis requires the coordinate induction of hundreds of genes that reside in the nucleus. We describe here a study of the regulation of the nuclear-encoded cytochrome c1 of the b-c1 complex. Unlike cytochrome c, which is encoded by two genes, CYC1 and CYC7, c1 is encoded by a single gene, CYT1. The regulatory region of the CYT1 promoter contains binding sites for the HAP1 and HAP2/3/4 transactivators that regulate CYC1. The binding of HAP1 to the CYT1 element was studied in detail and found to differ in two important respects from binding to the CYC1 element. First, while CYC1 contains two sites that bind HAP1 cooperatively, CYT1 has a single high-affinity site. Second, while the CYT1 site and the stronger HAP1-binding site of CYC1 share a large block of homology, the HAP1 footprints at these sites are offset by several nucleotides. We discuss how these differences in HAP1 binding might relate to the difference in the biology of cytochrome c and cytochrome c1."
14,Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society ,9657855; ,"Huntington's Disease (HD) is an inherited progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with a mutation in a gene expressed in both affected and non-affected tissues. The selective neuropathology in HD is thought to be mediated in part through interactions with other proteins including the Huntington Associated Protein, HAP-1, which is predominantly expressed in the brain. We have mapped its murine homolog, Hap1, to mouse Chr 11 (band D), which shares extensive synteny with human Chr 17 including the region 17q21-q22, where the gene for 'frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17' has bee mapped. In addition, we have sequenced a 21,984 base pair (bp) genomic clone encompassing the entire Hap1 gene. It is organized as 11 exons and flanked by exons from potentially one or more novel genes. At least three Hap1 transcripts (Hap1-A; Hap1-B; Hap1-C) can be formed by alternative splicing at the 3' end of the gene leading to protein isoforms with novel C-termini."
15,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico ,34564830; ,"Huntington disease (HD) is a single-gene autosomal dominant inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine expansion of the protein huntingtin (HTT). Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) is the first protein identified as an interacting partner of huntingtin, which is directly associated with HD. HAP1 is mainly expressed in the nervous system and is also found in the endocrine system and digestive system, and then involves in the occurrence of the related endocrine diseases, digestive system diseases, and cancer. Understanding the function of HAP1 could help elucidate the pathogenesis that HTT plays in the disease process. Therefore, this article attempts to summarize the latest research progress of the role of HAP1 and its application for diseases in recent years, aiming to clarify the functions of HAP1 and its interacting proteins, and provide new research ideas and new therapeutic targets for the treatment of cancer and related diseases."
16,Journal of virology ,28331092; ,"Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is a human pathogen that is a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus, which includes Vaccinia virus and Variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox). Human monkeypox is considered an emerging zoonotic infectious disease. To identify host factors required for MPXV infection, we performed a genome-wide insertional mutagenesis screen in human haploid cells. The screen revealed several candidate genes, including those involved in Golgi trafficking, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis. We validated the role of a set of vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) genes during infection, VPS51 to VPS54 (VPS51-54), which comprise the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex. The GARP complex is a tethering complex involved in retrograde transport of endosomes to the trans-Golgi apparatus. Our data demonstrate that VPS52 and VPS54 were dispensable for mature virion (MV) production but were required for extracellular virus (EV) formation. For comparison, a known antiviral compound, ST-246, was used in our experiments, demonstrating that EV titers in VPS52 and VPS54 knockout (KO) cells were comparable to levels exhibited by ST-246-treated wild-type cells. Confocal microscopy was used to examine actin tail formation, one of the viral egress mechanisms for cell-to-cell dissemination, and revealed an absence of actin tails in VPS52KO- or VPS54KO-infected cells. Further evaluation of these cells by electron microscopy demonstrated a decrease in levels of wrapped viruses (WVs) compared to those seen with the wild-type control. Collectively, our data demonstrate the role of GARP complex genes in double-membrane wrapping of MVs necessary for EV formation, implicating the host endosomal trafficking pathway in orthopoxvirus infection.IMPORTANCE Human monkeypox is an emerging zoonotic infectious disease caused by Monkeypox virus (MPXV). Of the two MPXV clades, the Congo Basin strain is associated with severe disease, increased mortality, and increased human-to-human transmission relative to the West African strain. Monkeypox is endemic in regions of western and central Africa but was introduced into the United States in 2003 from the importation of infected animals. The threat of MPXV and other orthopoxviruses is increasing due to the absence of routine smallpox vaccination leading to a higher proportion of naive populations. In this study, we have identified and validated candidate genes that are required for MPXV infection, specifically, those associated with the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex. Identifying host targets required for infection that prevents extracellular virus formation such as the GARP complex or the retrograde pathway can provide a potential target for antiviral therapy."
17,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine ,25081373; ,"Studies on the relationship of HAP1 polymorphisms (-141 T > G; 1349 T > G) and lung cancer risk to date indicated controversial results. This study was devised to clarify whether the polymorphisms predispose to lung cancer. We searched Embase and PubMed up to March 2014 to identify relevant studies. Data from the eligible studies were independently extracted by two investigators. Pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated to assess the associations between lung cancer risk and the abovementioned polymorphisms. A total of 15 case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. Both overall analysis and stratified analysis by ethnicity and smoking status indicated no association between lung cancer risk and the 1349 T > G polymorphism. However, a significantly reduced risk of lung cancer was found among carriers of the GG genotype of the -141 T > G polymorphism, as compared with those of the TT genotype (homozygote model: OR = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.93, P(OR) = 0.002). Likewise, the GG genotype was also found to decrease lung cancer risk compared to the GT + TT genotypes (recessive model: OR = 0.82, 95 % CI 0.73 to 0.92, P(OR) = 0.001). Our meta-analysis suggests that the -141 T > G polymorphism, but not the 1349 T > G polymorphism, may have protective effects for lung cancer."
18,BMC evolutionary biology ,27737633; ,"Huntingtin-associated Protein 1 (HAP1) is expressed in neurons and endocrine cells, and is critical for postnatal survival in mice. HAP1 shares a conserved ""HAP1_N"" domain with TRAfficking Kinesin proteins TRAK1 and TRAK2 (vertebrate), Milton (Drosophila) and T27A3.1 (C. elegans). HAP1, TRAK1 and TRAK2 have a degree of common function, particularly regarding intracellular receptor trafficking. However, TRAK1, TRAK2 and Milton (which have a ""Milt/TRAK"" domain that is absent in human and rodent HAP1) differ in function to HAP1 in that they are mitochondrial transport proteins, while HAP1 has emerging roles in starvation response. We have investigated HAP1 function by examining its evolution, and upstream gene promoter sequences. We performed phylogenetic analyses of the HAP1_N domain family of proteins, incorporating HAP1 orthologues (identified by genomic synteny) from 5 vertebrate classes, and also searched the Dictyostelium proteome for a common ancestor. Computational analyses of mammalian HAP1 gene promoters were performed to identify phylogenetically conserved regulatory motifs."
19,Experimental cell research ,21609716; ,"The stigmoid body (STB) is a cytoplasmic inclusion containing huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1), and HAP1/STB formation is induced by transfection of the HAP1 gene into cultured cells. In the present study, we examined the intracellular colocalization of HAP1/STBs with steroid hormone receptors (SHRs), including the androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and mineralocorticoid receptor, in COS-7 cells cotransfected with HAP1 and each receptor. We found that C-terminal ligand-binding domains of all SHRs had potential for colocalization with HAP1/STBs, whereas only AR and GR were clearly colocalized with HAP1/STBs when each full-length SHR was coexpressed with HAP1. In addition, it appeared that HAP1/STBs did not disrupt GR and AR functions because the receptors on HAP1/STBs maintained nuclear translocation activity in response to their specific ligands. When the cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor, GR and AR localized outside HAP1/STBs translocated into the nucleus, whereas the receptors colocalized with HAP1/STBs persisted in their colocalization even after treatment with their ligands. Therefore, HAP1/STBs may be involved in cytoplasmic modifications of the nuclear translocation of GR and AR in a ubiquitin-proteasome system."
20,FEBS letters ,21146532; ,"The function of the brainstem Hap1-Ahi1 complex in the regulation of feeding behavior was investigated. When mice were fasted or treated with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), Hap1-Ahi1 was significantly upregulated. By using streptozotocin (STZ) to decrease the circulating insulin in mice, Hap1-Ahi1 was significantly increased. Furthermore, intra-brain injection of insulin decreased the expression of Hap1-Ahi1 in the brainstem. Moreover, when we knocked down the expression of brainstem Hap1 by RNAi, the mice showed decreased food intake and lower body weights. Collectively, our results indicate that the Hap1-Ahi1 complex in the brainstem works as a sensor for insulin signals in feeding control."
21,Journal of molecular biology ,2851658; ,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the CYP1 gene that modulates the expression of iso1-(CYC1) and iso2-cytochrome c (CYP3) structural genes gives rise to two classes of mutated alleles; one class, represented by CYP1-18, has opposite effects on CYC1 and CYP3, it reduces the expression of CYC1 while it stimulates that of CYP3. The other class, represented by cyp1-23 or the related allele hap1-1, reduces the expression of both CYC1 and CYP3 genes. Genetic data suggested that the CYP1 product is a positive regulator of the cytochrome c genes. The CYP1-18 allele has been cloned. We show here that the iso2 overproducer function of CYP1-18 is included in a 5300 base XhoI-PstI fragment. The sequence of this fragment reveals a unique, long, uninterrupted open reading frame of 4449 nucleotides able to encode a protein of 1483 amino acid residues. The predicted product of this open reading frame contains several interesting features. The N-terminal part of the protein resembles a nucleic acid-binding domain, in which two domains can be distinguished. The first is similar to a ""finger"" DNA binding motif, as found in TFIIIA and other regulatory proteins. The second consists of seven tandemly repeated sequences with a KCPVDH motif. Because of its structure, it is tempting to speculate that this region may act as a ""redox sensor"" folded around a metal atom or heme and involved in recognition of respiratory effectors. These two domains are separated by an ""opa"" sequence of 13 Gln residues. Implication of these domains for the function of CYP1-18 is discussed."
22,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America ,32747555; ,"Huntington disease (HD) is an ideal model for investigating selective neurodegeneration, as expanded polyQ repeats in the ubiquitously expressed huntingtin (HTT) cause the preferential neurodegeneration in the striatum of the HD patient brains. Here we report that adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction-mediated depletion of Hap1, the first identified huntingtin-associated protein, in adult HD knock-in (KI) mouse brains leads to selective neuronal loss in the striatum. Further, Hap1 depletion-mediated neuronal loss via AAV transduction requires the presence of mutant HTT. Rhes, a GTPase that is enriched in the striatum and sumoylates mutant HTT to mediate neurotoxicity, binds more N-terminal HTT when Hap1 is deficient. Consistently, more soluble and sumoylated N-terminal HTT is presented in HD KI mouse striatum when HAP1 is absent. Our findings suggest that both Rhes and Hap1 as well as cellular stress contribute to the preferential neurodegeneration in HD, highlighting the involvement of multiple factors in selective neurodegeneration."
23,Neurobiology of disease ,31445164; ,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by maternal mutation and paternal imprinting of the gene encoding UBE3A, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Although several potential target proteins of UBE3A have been reported, how these proteins regulate neuronal development remains unclear. We performed a large-scale quantitative proteomic analysis using stable-isotope labeling of amino acids in mammals (SILAM) in mice with maternal Ube3a mutation. We identified huntingtin (Htt)-associated protein (HAP1), a protein that is involved in Huntington's disease (HD), as a new target of UBE3A. We demonstrate that HAP1 regulates autophagy at the initiation stage by promoting PtdIns3K complex formation and enhancing its activity. HAP1 also co-localized with MAP1LC3 (LC3) and other proteins involved in autophagosome expansion. As a result, HAP1 increased autophagy flux. Strikingly, knocking down of HAP1 alleviated aberrant autophagy in primary neurons from AS mice. Concordantly, treatment of AS neurons with an autophagy inhibitor alleviated the reduction in density of dendritic spines. Furthermore, autophagy inhibition in AS mice partially alleviated a social interaction deficit as shown in open field test. Thus, our results identify HAP1 as an in vivo UBE3A target that contributes to deregulated autophagy and synaptic dysfunction in the central nervous system of AS mouse."
24,Journal of molecular biology ,2851659; ,"In the accompanying paper, we present and analyse the sequence of a ""superactivator"" mutant allele of the CYP1 (HAP1) gene. This locus encodes a trans-acting pleiotropic positive regulator of the transcription of both isocytochrome c structural genes. In this paper, we present the genetic localization of the mutation and the sequence of the wild-type fragment that includes the mutation. The mutated phenotype that commutes the expression of the two isocytochrome structural genes (superactivation of CYP3 and inhibition of CYC1) results from a transversion in an AGT codon (serine) in the wild-type to an AGG codon (arginine) in the mutant. Moreover, we show that the missense mutation that affects the amino acid preceding the first cysteine of the ""Zn finger"" is responsible on its own account for the entire mutated phenotype. In all seven yeast regulatory proteins analysed so far, this position is occupied by a neutral amino acid (serine, alanine or glycine), thus the serine-arginine replacement is a radical one. This result is consistent with the hypothesis of alternative and mutually exclusive Zn fingers, formed either at low or high redox potential, recognizing the target sequences identified in the upstream regions of the CYC1 and CYP3 isocytochrome c structural genes."
25,Biomolecules ,36291713; ,"Co-translational incorporation of selenocysteine (Sec) into selenoproteins occurs at UGA codons in a process in which translational elongation competes with translational termination. Selenocysteine insertion sequence-binding protein 2 (SECISBP2) greatly enhances Sec incorporation into selenoproteins by interacting with the mRNA, ribosome, and elongation factor Sec (EFSEC). Ribosomal profiling allows to study the process of UGA re-coding in the physiological context of the cell and at the same time for all individual selenoproteins expressed in that cell. Using HAP1 cells expressing a mutant SECISBP2, we show here that high-resolution ribosomal profiling can be used to assess read-through efficiency at the UGA in all selenoproteins, including those with Sec close to the C-terminus. Analysis of ribosomes with UGA either at the A-site or the P-site revealed, in a transcript-specific manner, that SECISBP2 helps to recruit tRNASec and stabilize the mRNA. We propose to assess the effect of any perturbation of UGA read-through by determining the proportion of ribosomes carrying UGA in the P-site, pUGA. An additional, new observation is frameshifting that occurred 3' of the UGA/Sec codon in SELENOF and SELENOW in SECISBP2-mutant HAP1 cells, a finding corroborated by reanalysis of neuron-specific Secisbp2R543Q-mutant brains."

Inulinase activity in the supernatant of the recombinant Klhap1Delta strain was 391 U ml(-1) after cultured 120 h, which was 2.2-fold that of the wild type host. The relative inulinase mRNA level of the Klhap1Delta strain was 11.3-fold that of the wild type strain, and the expression plasmid was more stable in the mutant host. Based on these results, the disruption of hap1 facilitated the high and stable expression of inulinase controlled by Kcinu promoter in K. lactis."
27,Protein and peptide letters ,19519523; ,"The Hsp90 and Hsp70 molecular chaperones play important roles in the folding and proper functioning of diverse cellular proteins, including transcriptional regulators and protein kinases. In yeast, several transcriptional regulators and protein kinases are known to be substrates for Hsp90 and Hsp70 molecular chaperones. The yeast heme activator protein Hap1 promotes transcription of many genes in response to heme. It requires Hsp90 and Hsp70 molecular chaperones for its activity to be precisely regulated by heme concentration. The mechanism by which molecular chaperones promote heme regulation of Hap1 activity is distinct from the mechanism by which molecular chaperones promote steroid signaling. Hsp70 and Hsp90 molecular chaperones act separately to promote Hap1 repression in heme-deficient cells and heme activation of Hap1 in heme-sufficient cells. Likewise, distinct Hap1 elements or domains act to mediate Hap1 repression and heme activation separately. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the molecular mechanism governing heme regulation of Hap1 activity, and we compare this mechanism to the molecular mechanism by which Hsp90 and Hsp70 molecular chaperones promote the regulation of glucocorticoid receptor, the most extensively studied substrate of Hsp90 and Hsp70 molecular chaperones."

30,The Journal of biological chemistry ,34968463; ,"The monomorphic antigen-presenting molecule major histocompatibility complex-I-related protein 1 (MR1) presents small-molecule metabolites to mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. The MR1-MAIT cell axis has been implicated in a variety of infectious and noncommunicable diseases, and recent studies have begun to develop an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this specialized antigen presentation pathway. However, proteins regulating MR1 folding, loading, stability, and surface expression remain to be identified. Here, we performed a gene trap screen to discover novel modulators of MR1 surface expression through insertional mutagenesis of an MR1-overexpressing clone derived from the near-haploid human cell line HAP1 (HAP1.MR1). The most significant positive regulators identified included β2-microglobulin, a known regulator of MR1 surface expression, and ATP13A1, a P5-type ATPase in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) not previously known to be associated with MR1-mediated antigen presentation. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of ATP13A1 in both HAP1.MR1 and THP-1 cell lines revealed a profound reduction in MR1 protein levels and a concomitant functional defect specific to MR1-mediated antigen presentation. Collectively, these data are consistent with the ER-resident ATP13A1 being a key posttranscriptional determinant of MR1 surface expression."
31,Cell ,3030567; ,"We show that the yeast HAP1 activator locus encodes a protein that binds in vitro to the upstream activation site, UAS1, of the CYC1 gene (iso-1-cytochrome c). Binding of wild-type HAP1 and truncated HAP1 derivatives to UAS1 is evident in crudely fractionated yeast extracts using the gel electrophoresis DNA binding assay. The binding of HAP1 in vitro, like the activity of UAS1 in vivo, is stimulated by heme. HAP1 binds to region B, one of two portions of UAS1 shown to be important by genetic analysis of the site. Surprisingly, HAP1 binds to the same sequence as a second factor, RC2. Both HAP1 and RC2 bind to the same side of the helix, and make similar but not identical major and minor groove contacts that span two full turns. An additional factor that binds to the second important part of UAS1, the region A factor (RAF), is also identified. A model depicting the interplay of HAP1, RC2, and RAF in the control of UAS1 is presented."
32,Neuroscience ,30367943; ,"Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) is a neural interactor of huntingtin in Huntington's disease and interacts with gene products in a number of other neurodegenerative diseases. In normal brains, HAP1 is expressed abundantly in the hypothalamus and limbic-associated regions. These areas tend to be spared from neurodegeneration while those with little HAP1 are frequently neurodegenerative targets, suggesting its role as a protective factor against apoptosis. In light of the relationship between neurodegenerative diseases and deterioration of higher nervous activity, it is important to definitively clarify HAP1 expression in a cognitively important brain region, the retrosplenial-retrohippocampal area. Here, HAP1 expression was evaluated immunohistochemically over the retrosplenial cortex, the subicular complex, and the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices. HAP1-immunoreactive (ir) cells were classified into five discrete groups: (1) a distinct retrosplenial cell cluster exclusive to the superficial layers of the granular cortex, (2) a conspicuous, thin line of cells in layers IV/V of the ""subiculum-backing cortex,"" (3) a group of highly immunoreactive cells associated with the medial entorhinal-subicular corner, (4) pericallosal cells just below layer VI and adjacent to the white matter, and (5) other sporadic, widely-disseminated HAP1-immunoreactive cells. HAP1 was found to be the first marker for the complex subiculum-backing cortex and a precise marker for several subfields in the retrosplenial-retrohippocampal area, verified through comparative staining with other neurochemicals. HAP1 may play an important role in protecting these cortical structures and functions for higher nervous activity by increasing the threshold to neurodegeneration and decreasing vulnerability to stress or aging."
33,NPJ genomic medicine ,33990617; ,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) gain-of-function (GOF) is an autosomal dominant immune disorder marked by wide infectious predisposition, autoimmunity, vascular disease, and malignancy. Its molecular hallmark, elevated phospho-STAT1 (pSTAT1) following interferon (IFN) stimulation, is seen consistently in all patients and may not fully account for the broad phenotypic spectrum associated with this disorder. While over 100 mutations have been implicated in STAT1 GOF, genotype-phenotype correlation remains limited, and current overexpression models may be of limited use in gene expression studies. We generated heterozygous mutants in diploid HAP1 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 base-editing, targeting the endogenous STAT1 gene. Our models recapitulated the molecular phenotype of elevated pSTAT1, and were used to characterize the expression of five IFN-stimulated genes under a number of conditions. At baseline, transcriptional polarization was evident among mutants compared with wild type, and this was maintained following prolonged serum starvation. This suggests a possible role for unphosphorylated STAT1 in the pathogenesis of STAT1 GOF. Following stimulation with IFNα or IFNγ, differential patterns of gene expression emerged among mutants, including both gain and loss of transcriptional function. This work highlights the importance of modeling heterozygous conditions, and in particular transcription factor-related disorders, in a manner which accurately reflects patient genotype and molecular signature. Furthermore, we propose a complex and multifactorial transcriptional profile associated with various STAT1 mutations, adding to global efforts in establishing STAT1 GOF genotype-phenotype correlation and enhancing our understanding of disease pathogenesis."
34,Genetics ,15654089; ,"The yeast heme activator protein Hap1 binds to DNA and activates transcription of genes encoding functions required for respiration and for controlling oxidative damage, in response to heme. Hap1 contains a DNA-binding domain with a C6 zinc cluster motif, a coiled-coil dimerization element, typical of the members of the yeast Gal4 family, and an acidic activation domain. The regulation of Hap1 transcription-activating activity is controlled by two classes of Hap1 elements, repression modules (RPM1-3) and heme-responsive motifs (HRM1-7). Previous indirect evidence indicates that Hap1 may repress transcription directly. Here we show, by promoter analysis, by chromatin immunoprecipitation, and by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, that Hap1 binds directly to DNA and represses transcription of its own gene by at least 20-fold. We found that Hap1 repression of the HAP1 gene occurs independently of heme concentrations. While DNA binding is required for transcriptional repression by Hap1, deletion of Hap1 activation domain and heme-regulatory elements has varying effects on repression. Further, we found that repression by Hap1 requires the function of Hsp70 (Ssa), but not Hsp90. These results show that Hap1 binds to its own promoter and represses transcription in a heme-independent but Hsp70-dependent manner."

Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process, whose dysregulation is involved in the pathogenesis of various human diseases, including cancer. We investigated the involvement of TRAF2 in autophagy regulation in the human leukemic HAP1 cell line, under both basal and ER stress conditions. In TRAF2-knockout HAP1 cell line (KO), the basal autophagic flux was higher than in the parental cell line (WT). Moreover, tunicamycin-induced ER stress stimulated JNK activation and autophagy both in WT and KO HAP1. On the other hand, re-expression of a TRAF2 C-terminal fragment (residues ,310-501), in a TRAF2-KO cellular background, rendered HAP1 cells unable to activate both JNK and autophagy upon ER stress induction. Of note, this apparent dominant negative effect of the C-terminal fragment was observed even in the absence of the endogenous, full-length TRAF2 molecule. Furthermore, the expression of the C-terminal fragment resulted in both protein kinase B (AKT) pathway activation and increased resistance to the toxic effects induced by prolonged ER stress conditions. These findings indicate that TRAF2 is dispensable for the activation of both JNK and autophagy in HAP1 cells, while the TRAF2 C-terminal domain may play an autonomous role in regulating the cellular response to ER stress."

We have cloned the HAP1 gene and determined its complete nucleotide sequence. The site of transcription initiation has been mapped to 452 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon in the genomic DNA. The HAP1 gene consists of five exons and is unusually small (less than 2.6 kb from transcription initiation site to polyadenylation sequence) with 54% of the protein coding region and the entire 3' untranslated region contained within a single exon. The first exon is non-coding. Regions of three exons show sequence homology to the E.coli xth (exonuclease III) gene.

Recently, potential modulators of endometrial receptivity (OVGP1, MRAP2, ZCCHC12, and HAP1) have been reported likely with a functional role during embryo implantation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the gene expression of these genes in the endometrium of infertile women. Eighteen endometrial biopsies, during secretory lutheal phase, were recruited from women with unexplained infertility and women who cannot conceive due to their partners' fertility problems. qRT-PCR was carried out to evaluate MRAP2, OVGP1, ZCCHC12 and HAP1 gene expression. MRAP2 expression was also detected by western blot and it was localized by immunohistochemistry. Morphological analysis was performed by light microscopy. MRAP2 was significantly up-regulated in study vs. control group. Western blot analysis confirmed the observed MRAP2 up-expression. MRAP2 resulted mainly localized in the epithelial cells of uterine glands. Morphological analysis displayed that the epithelium of the uterine glands undergo hypertrophy in women with unexplained infertility in respect to women with male infertility factor. MRAP2 could be considered a mediator of endometrial receptivity likely acting on endometrial stability by binding to MCRs and PKR1."
39,Neurochemical research ,32419121; ,"The number of γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs) expressed on the surface membrane and at synaptic sites is implicated in the enhanced excitation of neuronal circuits and abnormal network oscillations in epilepsy. Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1), a key mediator of pathological alterations in protein trafficking, directly interacts with GABAARs and facilitates their recycling back to synapses after internalization from the surface; thus, HAP1 regulates the strength of inhibitory synaptic transmission. Here, we show that HAP1 modulates epileptic seizures by regulating GABAAR function in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and in the pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced epileptic model. We demonstrate that GABAARβ2/3 and HAP1 expression are decreased and that the HAP1-GABAARβ2/3 complex is disrupted in the epileptic rat brain. We found that HAP1 upregulation exerts antiepileptic activity in the PTZ-induced seizure and that these changes are associated with increased surface GABAARβ2/3 expression and the amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). This study provides evidence that hippocampal HAP1 is linked to GABAARs in evoking seizures and suggests that this mechanism is involved in epileptic seizures in the brain, representing a potential therapeutic target for epilepsy."

42,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America ,32209662; ,"A significant fraction of the glycerophospholipids in the human body is composed of plasmalogens, particularly in the brain, cardiac, and immune cell membranes. A decline in these lipids has been observed in such diseases as Alzheimer's and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Plasmalogens contain a characteristic 1-O-alk-1'-enyl ether (vinyl ether) double bond that confers special biophysical, biochemical, and chemical properties to these lipids. However, the genetics of their biosynthesis is not fully understood, since no gene has been identified that encodes plasmanylethanolamine desaturase (E.C. 1.14.99.19), the enzyme introducing the crucial alk-1'-enyl ether double bond. The present work identifies this gene as transmembrane protein 189 (TMEM189). Inactivation of the TMEM189 gene in human HAP1 cells led to a total loss of plasmanylethanolamine desaturase activity, strongly decreased plasmalogen levels, and accumulation of plasmanylethanolamine substrates and resulted in an inability of these cells to form labeled plasmalogens from labeled alkylglycerols. Transient expression of TMEM189 protein, but not of other selected desaturases, recovered this deficit. TMEM189 proteins contain a conserved protein motif (pfam10520) with eight conserved histidines that is shared by an alternative type of plant desaturase but not by other mammalian proteins. Each of these histidines is essential for plasmanylethanolamine desaturase activity. Mice homozygous for an inactivated Tmem189 gene lacked plasmanylethanolamine desaturase activity and had dramatically lowered plasmalogen levels in their tissues. These results assign the TMEM189 gene to plasmanylethanolamine desaturase and suggest that the previously characterized phenotype of Tmem189-deficient mice may be caused by a lack of plasmalogens."

44,PLoS pathogens ,36574441; ,"Genome-wide genetic screens are powerful tools to identify genes that act as host factors of viruses. We have applied this technique to analyze the infection of HeLa cells by Vaccinia virus, in an attempt to find genes necessary for infection. Infection of cell populations harboring single gene inactivations resulted in no surviving cells, suggesting that no single gene knock-out was able to provide complete resistance to Vaccinia virus and thus allow cells to survive infection. In the absence of an absolute infection blockage, we explored if some gene inactivations could provide partial protection leading to a reduced probability of infection. Multiple experiments using modified screening procedures involving replication restricted viruses led to the identification of multiple genes whose inactivation potentially increase resistance to infection and therefore cell survival. As expected, significant gene hits were related to proteins known to act in virus entry, such as ITGB1 and AXL as well as genes belonging to their downstream related pathways. Additionally, we consistently found β2-microglobulin, encoded by the B2M gene, among the screening top hits, a novel finding that was further explored. Inactivation of B2M resulted in 54% and 91% reduced VV infection efficiency in HeLa and HAP1 cell lines respectively. In the absence of B2M, while virus binding to the cells was unaffected, virus internalization and early gene expression were significantly diminished. These results point to β2-microglobulin as a relevant factor in the Vaccinia virus entry process."

However, its fruiting body formation and development processes have not been elucidated. In this study, the developmental transcriptomes were analyzed at three stages: the mycelium (G-S), primordium (P-S) and fruiting body (M-F) stages. A total of 9690 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the different developmental stages. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses showed that these DEGs were involved mainly in hydrolase activity, structural molecule activity and oxidoreductase activity as well as xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism and energy metabolism pathways. We further found that the higher expression of most carbohydrate enzyme (i.e., GH, CE, CBM, AA and PL) genes in the hyphal (i.e., G-S) stage was related mainly to substrate degradation, while the upregulation of glycosyltransferase (GT) gene expression in the P-S and M-F stages may be related to cell wall synthesis. In addition, we found that CO2-sensing-related genes (i.e., CA-2, CA-3, PKA-1 and PKA-2) were upregulated in the P-S and M-F stages, heat shock protein genes (HSP60 and HSP90) were significantly downregulated in the P-S stage and upregulated in the M-F stage and the transcription factors (i.e., steA, MYB, nosA, HAP1, and GATA-4/5/6) involved in growth and development were significantly upregulated in the P-S stage. These results suggest that environmental factors (i.e., CO2 and temperature) and transcription factors may play a key role in primordium formation. In short, this study provides new insights into the study of stimulating primordia formation affecting the development of fruiting bodies of S. rugosoannulata."

Here, we have performed whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screens for STAG2-dependent genetic interactions in three distinct cellular backgrounds. Surprisingly, STAG1, the paralog of STAG2, was the only negative genetic interaction that was shared across all three backgrounds. We also uncovered a paralogous synthetic lethal mechanism behind a genetic interaction between STAG2 and the iron regulatory gene IREB2 Finally, investigation of an unusually strong context-dependent genetic interaction in HAP1 cells revealed factors that could be important for alleviating cohesin loading stress.

In addition, HAP2 was associated with more CAG repeats (r = 1.17, p = 0.033) and HAP3 with fewer CAG repeats (r = -2.93, p < 0.001) than the major haplotype HAP1. HAP3 and HAP4 were associated with more GGN repeats (r = 1.35, p = 0.001 and r = 1.36, p = 0.002, respectively) than HAP1.

Negative PCR results were observed with all saprophytic leptospire strains used as well as with other spirochetes and bacteria commonly found in biological samples. The results of direct PCR performed on biological samples, such as blood, urine or kidneys correlated with the results obtained with the classical Leptospira tests (culture and MAT).

50,PLoS genetics ,36084128; ,"Heme (iron-protoporphyrin IX) is an essential but potentially toxic cellular cofactor. While most organisms are heme prototrophs, many microorganisms can utilize environmental heme as iron source. The pathogenic yeast Candida albicans can utilize host heme in the iron-poor host environment, using an extracellular cascade of soluble and anchored hemophores, and plasma membrane ferric reductase-like proteins. To gain additional insight into the C. albicans heme uptake pathway, we performed an unbiased genetic selection for mutants resistant to the toxic heme analog Ga3+-protoporphyrin IX at neutral pH, and a secondary screen for inability to utilize heme as iron source. Among the mutants isolated were the genes of the pH-responsive RIM pathway, and a zinc finger transcription factor related to S. cerevisiae HAP1. In the presence of hemin in the medium, C. albicans HAP1 is induced, the Hap1 protein is stabilized and Hap1-GFP localizes to the nucleus. In the hap1 mutant, cytoplasmic heme levels are elevated, while influx of extracellular heme is lower. Gene expression analysis indicated that in the presence of extracellular hemin, Hap1 activates the heme oxygenase HMX1, which breaks down excess cytoplasmic heme, while at the same time it also activates all the known heme uptake genes. These results indicate that Hap1 is a heme-responsive transcription factor that plays a role both in cytoplasmic heme homeostasis and in utilization of extracellular heme. The induction of heme uptake genes by C. albicans Hap1 under iron satiety indicates that preferential utilization of host heme can be a dietary strategy in a heme prototroph."
51,Molecular and cellular biology ,17785431; ,"Changes in oxygen levels cause widespread changes in gene expression in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this response is mediated in part by Hap1, originally identified as a heme-dependent transcriptional activator that functions during aerobic growth. We show here that Hap1 also plays a significant and direct role under hypoxic conditions, not as an activator, but as a repressor. The repressive activity of Hap1 controls several genes, including three ERG genes required for ergosterol biosynthesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Hap1 binds to the ERG gene promoters, while additional experiments showed that the corepressor Tup1/Ssn6 is recruited by Hap1 and is also required for repression. Furthermore, mutational analysis demonstrated that conserved Hap1 binding sites in the ERG5 5' regulatory region are required for repression. The switch of Hap1 from acting as a hypoxic repressor to an aerobic activator is determined by heme, which is synthesized only in the presence of oxygen. The ability of Hap1 to function as a ligand-dependent repressor and activator is a property shared with mammalian nuclear hormone receptors and likely allows greater transcriptional control by Hap1 in response to changing oxygen levels."

Using a BTG1 promoter-harboring reporter gene and siRNA, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) was identified as an essential transcription factor for CST/Met (-)-mediated BTG1 induction. Although knockout of BTG1 in human HAP1 cells did not affect the accumulation of reactive oxygen species induced by CST/Met (-), BTG1 knockout significantly decreased the induction of genes associated with the integrated stress response, and reduced lipid peroxidation and cell death in response to CST/Met (-). The results demonstrate that CST/Met (-) induces ferroptosis by activating ATF4-dependent BTG1 induction."

While pan- and class-specific HDAC inhibitors are available, these drugs do not allow a comprehensive understanding of individual HDAC function, or the therapeutic potential of isoform-specific targeting. To systematically compare the impact of individual catalytic functions of HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3, we generated human HAP1 cell lines expressing catalytically inactive HDAC enzymes. Using this genetic toolbox we compare the effect of individual HDAC inhibition with the effects of class I specific inhibitors on cell viability, protein acetylation and gene expression. Individual inactivation of HDAC1 or HDAC2 has only mild effects on cell viability, while HDAC3 inactivation or loss results in DNA damage and apoptosis. Inactivation of HDAC1/HDAC2 led to increased acetylation of components of the COREST co-repressor complex, reduced deacetylase activity associated with this complex and derepression of neuronal genes. HDAC3 controls the acetylation of nuclear hormone receptor associated proteins and the expression of nuclear hormone receptor regulated genes. Acetylation of specific histone acetyltransferases and HDACs is sensitive to inactivation of HDAC1/HDAC2. Over a wide range of assays, we determined that in particular HDAC1 or HDAC2 catalytic inactivation mimics class I specific HDAC inhibitors. Importantly, we further demonstrate that catalytic inactivation of HDAC1 or HDAC2 sensitizes cells to specific cancer drugs. In summary, our systematic study revealed isoform-specific roles of HDAC1/2/3 catalytic functions. We suggest that targeted genetic inactivation of particular isoforms effectively mimics pharmacological HDAC inhibition allowing the identification of relevant HDACs as targets for therapeutic intervention."

We hypothesized that these differences in expression levels were caused by a defect of a transcriptional factor Hap1, because strain X2180 contained a Ty1 insertion mutation in the HAP1 gene. To confirm this, we constructed a strain X2180 derivative (strain HX) that contained the wild-type HAP1 genes originating from strain K7. The expression levels of ergosterol-related genes and cellular ergosterol content in strain HX were higher than those in strain X2180 and were almost comparable to those in strain K7. These results suggest that the differences in the expression levels of ergosterol-related genes and ergosterol content between strains K7 and X2180 were largely caused by the hap1 mutation in strain X2180. Involvement of the mutated Hap1 in the differential gene expression between strain K7 and strain X2180 was further confirmed by a lacZ reporter assay of HMG1, one of the Hap1-regulated genes.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that treatment with IL-1β resulted in an increase in p38/ERK phosphorylation, and activators of p38/ERK enhanced the effect of IL-1β on the expression some of the key genes, whereas p38/ERK inhibitors reversed these effects. In conclusion, the present study highlights key genes involved in the development of neuropathic pain through activation of SCs after nerve injury. Identification of these genes and subsequent evidence of their mediation by IL-1β treatment promote our understanding of molecular mechanisms of nerve injury induced neuropathic pain, and highlight potential molecular targets for the treatment of neuropathic pain."
59,Communications biology ,35854076; ,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a ubiquitous pathogen that causes various diseases in humans, ranging from common mucocutaneous lesions to severe life-threatening encephalitis. However, our understanding of the interaction between HSV-1 and human host factors remains incomplete. Here, to identify the host factors for HSV-1 infection, we performed a human genome-wide CRISPR screen using near-haploid HAP1 cells, in which gene knockout (KO) could be efficiently achieved. Along with several already known host factors, we identified 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate synthase 1 (PAPSS1) as a host factor for HSV-1 infection. The KO of PAPSS1 in HAP1 cells reduced heparan sulfate (HepS) expression, consequently diminishing the binding of HSV-1 and several other HepS-dependent viruses (such as HSV-2, hepatitis B virus, and a human seasonal coronavirus). Hence, our findings provide further insights into the host factor requirements for HSV-1 infection and HepS biosynthesis."
60,Microbiological reviews ,1579104; ,"The oxygen regulation of two broad categories of yeast genes is discussed in this review. The first is made up of genes regulated by heme, and the second is made up of genes whose regulation is heme independent. Heme-regulated genes fall into two classes: heme-activated and heme-repressed genes. Activation is achieved through one of two transcriptional activators, the heme-dependent HAP1 protein or the heme-activated, glucose-repressed HAP2/3/4 complex. Some of the properties and the DNA-binding sites of these activators are discussed. Heme repression is achieved through the action of the ROX1 repressor, the expression of which is transcriptionally activated by heme. Once ROX1 is synthesized, its function is heme independent. Evidence that ROX1 binds to DNA or is part of a DNA-binding complex is described. Factors which modulate the function of these regulatory proteins are discussed, and a schematic of heme activation and repression is presented. The mitochondrial subunits of cytochrome c oxidase are induced by oxygen in a heme-independent fashion. The translation of one, cytochrome c oxidase subunit III, is dependent upon three nucleus-encoded initiation factors. One of these, PET494, is itself translationally regulated by oxygen in a heme-independent fashion. The expression of at least four other mitochondrially encoded cytochrome subunits is dependent upon specific translation factors, raising the potential for translational regulation as a general mechanism. Finally, a number of anaerobic genes that show heme-independent, oxygen-repressed expression have been identified. These fall into two kinetic classes, suggesting that there are at least two different regulatory circuitries."

Knowledge of these host cell requirements not only reveals molecular pathways exploited by the virus or triggered by the immune system but also provides further targets for antiviral drug development. To uncover critical pathways and potential targets of influenza infection, we assembled a large amount of data from 8 RNA sequencing studies of IAV infection for integrative network analysis. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to investigate modules and genes correlated with the time course of infection and/or multiplicity of infection (MOI). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed to explore the biological functions and pathways of the genes in 5 significant modules. Top hub genes were identified using the cytoHubba plugin in the protein interaction network. The correlation between expression levels of 7 top hub genes and time course or MOI was displayed and validated, including BCL2L13, PLSCR1, ARID5A, LMO2, NDRG4, HAP1, and CARD10. Dysregulated expression of these genes potently impacted the development of IAV infection through modulating IAV-related biological processes and pathways. This study provides further insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms and potential targets in IAV infection."

In this report we describe the modulatory functions of a non-DNA-binding protein, SIN3 (also known as SDI1, UME4, RPD1, and GAM2) on the transactivation properties of the human progesterone receptor (hPR), GAL4, and the HAP1 activator in yeast. Our data suggest that SIN3 is a dual function protein. It negatively regulates the transcriptional activities of hPR-A and hPR-B by affecting the N-terminal activation domain (AF1). SIN3 positively regulates the transcriptional activities of GAL4 and the HAP1 activator. However, it has no effect on the transcriptional activities of the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) and GCN4. The SIN3 protein contains four copies of a paired amphipathic helix (PAH) motif. Deletion analysis of the SIN3 PAH motifs shows that the PAH3 motif is essential for SIN3-mediated regulation of hPR, GAL4, and the HAP1 activator. In contrast, the PAH1, PAH2, and PAH4 motifs are not required for SIN3-mediated regulation of these activators. Additionally, we examined the mechanism(s) by which the SIN3 protein modulate the activities of various activators. We are unable to demonstrate the direct interaction of SIN3 protein with these activators using the yeast two-hybrid system or co-immunoprecipitation. These data suggest that SIN3 regulates the transactivation functions of hPR, GAL4, and the HAP1 activator by an indirect mechanism."

Its cytoplasmic tail, physically associated with a protein tyrosine kinase, is important in the activation of helper/inducer T lymphocytes. In Bos taurus, CD4 gene is located on chromosome 5 from which two isoforms are transcribed, with a different number of amino acids due to splicing of exon 7 and variation in the reading frame. The aim of this study was to investigate the sequence of the entire CD4 gene in Simmental sires to evaluate the effects of genomic variants on the indexes of the bulls for milk, fat and protein yields, as well as somatic cell score. The associations among genomic variants and indexes were analysed using the Allele and GLM procedures of SAS 9.4. The analysis indicated that only four of the thirty-one identified SNPs influenced the considered traits. Identified variants insist on coding zones and intronic sequences, where we revealed the presence of sites for transcription factors. To evaluate the existence of haplotypic effects, combinations among the four genomic variants (SNP 3, SNP 8, SNP 11 and SNP 19) were investigated. Six different haplotypic alleles were identified, but only four of them were frequent enough to allow for an evaluation of any haplotypic effect (at least six copies in the examined sample): Hap1, Hap2, Hap3 and Hap6. The analysis of associations between the selected haplotypes in the CD4 gene with milk related indexes showed that bulls with Hap2 (T-A-C-C) had better indexes for milk and protein yields (P < 0.05), whereas the presence of the Hap1 haplotype (A-G-A-T) caused a significant decrease of the index for protein yield (P < 0.05). Frequencies of the two alleles Hap1 and Hap2 (9 and 36% respectively) make them of interest for their possible inclusion in breeding schemes and support the hypothesis of considering this gene as a candidate for the improvement of milk-related traits in the Simmental breed."

Two separate mutations in the DNA-binding domain, S63G (HAP1-PC7) and S63R (HAP1-18), retain wild-type binding affinity. However, HAP1-PC7 is transcriptionally silent while HAP1-18 shows highly elevated levels of transcription. We have determined the X-ray crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of HAP1-PC7 bound to its DNA target, UAS(CYC7), and compared it to the previously solved HAP1-wt and HAP1-18 complexes to UAS(CYC7). Additionally, we have quantitatively compared the DNA-binding affinity and specificity of the HAP1-PC7, HAP1-18 and HAP1-wt DNA-binding domains. We show that, although the DNA-binding domains of these three proteins bind UAS(CYC7) with comparable affinity and specificity, the protein-DNA interactions are dramatically different between the three complexes. Conserved protein-DNA interactions are largely restricted to an internal DNA sequence that excludes one of the two conserved DNA half-sites of UAS(CYC7) suggesting a mode of recognition distinct from other HAP1 family members. Alternative protein-DNA interactions result in divergent DNA configurations between the three complexes. These results suggest that the differential transcriptional activities of the HAP1, HAP1-18 and HAP1-PC7 proteins are due, at least in part, to alternative protein-DNA contacts, and implies that HAP1-DNA interactions have direct allosteric effects on transcriptional activation."

CRISPR/Cas9 targeting revealed that HAP1 deficiency in the developing human neurons did not affect neuronal differentiation and gene expression as seen in the mouse neurons. However, deletion of HAP1 exacerbated neurotoxicity of mutant HTT in the organotypic brain slices of adult monkeys.

In this study, we intend to recover the distortion of the mitochondrial lipid composition, especially CL, for Barth syndrome treatment. The genetically edited TAZ knockout HAP1 cells were demonstrated to be a suitable cellular model, where CL desaturation occurred and monolyso-CL (MLCL) was accumulated. From the species analysis by mass spectrometry, phosphatidylethanolamine showed changed species content after TAZ knockout. TAZ knockout also caused genetic down-regulation of PGS gene and up-regulation of PNPLA8 gene, which may decrease the biosynthesis of CLs and increase the hydrolysis product MLCL. Supplemented phosphatidylglycerol(18:1)2 (PG(18:1)2) was successfully biosynthesized to mature symmetrical CL and drastically decrease the concentration of MLCL to recover the morphology of mitochondria and the cristae shape of inner mitochondria.

70,Kidney international ,9027731; ,"Baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, can adapt to growth under severe oxygen limitation. Two regulatory systems are described here that control this adaptation. The first involves a heme-dependent repression mechanism. Cells sense hypoxia through the inability to maintain oxygen-dependent heme biosynthesis. Under aerobic conditions, heme accumulates and serves as an effector for the transcriptional activator Hap1. The heme-Hap1 complex activates transcription of the ROX1 gene that encodes a repressor of one set of hypoxic genes. Under hypoxic conditions, heme levels fall, and a heme-deficient Hap1 complex represses ROX1 expression. As a consequence, the hypoxic genes are derepressed. The second regulatory system activates gene expression in response to a variety of stress conditions, including oxygen limitation. Oxygen sensing in this system is heme-independent. The same DNA sequence mediates transcriptional activation of each stress signal."

The 46 homologous miRNA genes in C19MC are highly expressed in the placenta, but repressed in other tissues by DNA methylation. Here, we found that the SET domain bifurcated 1(SETDB1), a histone H3-lysine 9 (H3K9)-specific methyltransferase 1, transcriptionally controls C19MC miRNA genes in a coordinated manner in human HAP1 cells. SETDB1 knockout (KO) resulted in the overexpression of C19MC miRNA genes, which was accompanied by a reduction of H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) in the cluster. We found that SETDB1 specifically binds to and modifies the upstream promoter locus of C19MC with H3K9me3, suggesting its role as a C19MC repressor. Overexpression of C19MC miRNA genes was not related to DNA methylation because cytosine methylation levels were not altered in the C19MC of SETDB1 KO cells, indicating that SETDB1 KO does not cause DNA demethylation in the C19MC promoter and body regions. In conclusion, our results suggest that SETDB1 binding and H3K9 methylation at the C19MC promoter and body regions are responsible for the coordinated regulation of miRNA genes in the cluster."
74,"Yeast (Chichester, England) ",12112237; ,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae adapts to altered oxygen availability by differentially expressing a number of genes. Under aerobic conditions oxygen control of gene expression is exerted through the activator Hap1 and the repressor Rox1. The Hap1 transcription factor senses cellular heme status and increases expression of aerobic genes in response to oxygen. The repression of hypoxic genes under normoxic conditions results from Hap1-mediated activation of ROX1 transcription. To allow the identification of additional Hap1 and Rox1 target genes, genome-wide expression was analysed in aerobically, chemostat-cultivated hap1 and rox1 null mutants. The microarray results show that deletion of HAP1 causes a lower transcript level of 51 genes. Transcription of 40 genes was increased in rox1 mutant cells compared to wild-type cells. Combining these results with our previously described transcriptome data of aerobically and anaerobically grown cells and with computational analysis of the promoters identified 24 genes that are potentially regulated by Hap1, and 38 genes satisfied the criteria of being direct targets of Rox1. In addition, this work provides further evidence that Rox1 controls transcription of anaerobic genes through repression under normoxic conditions."
75,PLoS genetics ,29649251; ,"Gene expression variation is extensive in nature, and is hypothesized to play a major role in shaping phenotypic diversity. However, connecting differences in gene expression across individuals to higher-order organismal traits is not trivial. In many cases, gene expression variation may be evolutionarily neutral, and in other cases expression variation may only affect phenotype under specific conditions. To understand connections between gene expression variation and stress defense phenotypes, we have been leveraging extensive natural variation in the gene expression response to acute ethanol in laboratory and wild Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. Previous work found that the genetic architecture underlying these expression differences included dozens of ""hotspot"" loci that affected many transcripts in trans. In the present study, we provide new evidence that one of these expression QTL hotspot loci affects natural variation in one particular stress defense phenotype-ethanol-induced cross protection against severe doses of H2O2. A major causative polymorphism is in the heme-activated transcription factor Hap1p, which we show directly impacts cross protection, but not the basal H2O2 resistance of unstressed cells. This provides further support that distinct cellular mechanisms underlie basal and acquired stress resistance. We also show that Hap1p-dependent cross protection relies on novel regulation of cytosolic catalase T (Ctt1p) during ethanol stress in a wild oak strain. Because ethanol accumulation precedes aerobic respiration and accompanying reactive oxygen species formation, wild strains with the ability to anticipate impending oxidative stress would likely be at an advantage. This study highlights how strategically chosen traits that better correlate with gene expression changes can improve our power to identify novel connections between gene expression variation and higher-order organismal phenotypes."

However, MAOA possesses a second VNTR, 500 bp upstream of the uVNTR, which is termed d- or distal VNTR. Furthermore, genomic analysis indicates that there are a minimum of two transcriptional start sites (TSSs) for MAOA, one of which encompasses the uVNTR within the 5' untranslated region of one of the isoforms. Through expression analysis in semi-haploid HAP1 cell lines genetically engineered in order to knockout (KO) either the uVNTR, dVNTR, or both VNTRs, we assessed the effect of the two MAOA VNTRs, either alone or in combination, on gene expression directed from the different TSSs. Complementing our functional analysis, we determined the haplotype variation of these VNTRs in the general population. The expression of the two MAOA isoforms was differentially modulated by the two VNTRs located in the promoter region. The most extensively studied uVNTR, previously considered a positive regulator of the MAOA gene, did not modulate the expression of what it is considered the canonical isoform, while we found that the dVNTR positively regulated this isoform in our model. In contrast, both the uVNTR and the dVNTR were found to act as negative regulators of the second less abundant MAOA isoform. The haplotype analysis for these two VNTRs demonstrated a bias against the presence of one of the potential variants. The uVNTR and dVNTR differentially affect expression of distinct MAOA isoforms, and thus, their combined profiling offers new insights into gene-regulation, GxE interaction, and ultimately MAOA-driven behavior."

We analyzed THBS4 genetic variability in humans and show that two haplotypes (hap1 and hap2) are maintained by balancing selection and modulate THBS4 expression in lymphocytes. Indeed, the balancing selection region covers a predicted transcriptional enhancer. In humans, but not in macaques and chimpanzees, THBS4 brain expression increases with age, and variants in the balancing selection region interact with sex in influencing THBS4 expression (pinteraction = 0.038), with hap1 homozygous females showing lowest expression. In Alzheimer disease (AD) patients, significant interactions between sex and THBS4 genotype were detected for peripheral gray matter (pinteraction = 0.014) and total gray matter (pinteraction = 0.012) volumes. Similarly to the gene expression results, the interaction is mainly mediated by hap1 homozygous AD females, who show reduced volumes. Thus, the balancing selection target in THBS4 is likely represented by one or more variants that regulate tissue-specific and sex-specific gene expression. The selection signature associated with THBS4 might not be related to AD pathogenesis, but rather to inflammatory responses."

The expanded glutamine repeat is thought to mediate a gain of function by causing huntingtin to abnormally interact with other proteins. We previously identified a rat huntingtin-associated protein (HAP1) that binds to huntingtin; HAP1 binds more tightly to huntingtin with an expanded glutamine repeat than to wild type huntingtin. Identification of the human homologue of HAP1 is necessary for investigation of the potential role of HAP1 in HD pathology. Here, we report the cloning of a human HAP1 homologue (hHAP) that shares 62% identity with rat HAP1 over its entire sequence and 82% amino acid identity in the putative huntingtin-binding region. The hHAP gene encodes a 4.1-kilobase transcript and a 75-kDa protein which are specifically expressed in human brain tissues. Its expression in Huntington's disease brains is reduced in parallel with a decreased expression of huntingtin. While two isoforms of rat HAP1 are expressed at similar levels in rat brain, only a single major form of hHAP is found in primate brains. In vitro binding, immunoprecipitation, and coexpression studies confirm the interaction of hHAP with huntingtin. The in vitro binding of hHAP to huntingtin is enhanced by lengthening the glutamine repeat. Despite similar binding properties of rat HAP1 and hHAP, differences in the sequences and expression of hHAP may contribute to a specific role for its interaction with huntingtin in humans."

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, heme serves as a secondary signal for oxygen; intracellular heme synthesis directly correlates with oxygen tension in the environment. In yeast, oxygen sensing and heme signaling are primarily mediated by the heme activator protein Hap1, which, in response to heme, activates the transcription of genes required for respiration and for controlling oxidative damage. Heme regulation of many genes required for anaerobic growth is mediated by the aerobic repressor Rox1, whose expression is controlled by heme. In this review, we summarize recent knowledge about (i) how heme synthesis may be controlled by oxygen tension, (ii) how heme precisely and stringently controls Hap1 activity and (iii) whether other transcriptional activators can also mediate heme action."

87,Animal biotechnology ,28267410; ,"The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a Class C G-protein coupled receptor that regulates food intake and assimilation. However, studies on the relationship between CaSR gene and growth traits in cattle are deficient. The aim of this study was to examine the association of the CaSR polymorphism with growth traits in cattle breeds. Four novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one previously reported SNP (NC_007299.5: g.67630865T>C, 67638409G>C, 67660395G>C, 67661546C>G, and 67661892A>C) were identified in the bovine CaSR gene using DNA sequencing and PCR-SSCP methods in 520 individuals from three representative breeds. The three SNP P4_2, P7_1, and P7_4 in LX, QC, and JX cattle populations belonged to intermediate genetic diversity (0.25 < PIC < 0.5). In addition, we evaluated the haplotype frequency and linkage disequilibrium coefficient of five sequence variants in the three cattle breeds. LD and haplotype structure of CaSR were different between breeds. LD analysis showed that the P4_2 and P7_4 loci were in complete LD in JX cattle population (r2 = 0.99 and D' = 1). Only 11 haplotypes were listed except for those with a frequency of <0.03. Hap1 (-TGGGC-) had the highest haplotype frequencies in LX (27.30%), Hap6(-TGGCC-) had the highest haplotype frequencies in QC (21.70%) and JX (32.30%). Association analysis indicated that P2, P4_2, and P7_4 loci were all significantly associated with growth traits and combined genotype TTGCGC was highly significantly associated with Chest circumference and body weight than the other genotype in JX cattle population. The results of this study suggest that the CaSR gene possibly is a strong candidate gene that affects growth traits in the Chinese cattle breeding program."
88,Molecular and cellular biology ,1588959; ,"HEM13 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes coproporphyrinogen oxidase, an enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Expression of HEM13 is repressed by oxygen and heme. This study investigated the regulatory pathway responsible for the regulation of HEM13 expression. The transcriptional activator HAP1 is demonstrated to be required for the full-level expression of HEM13 in the absence of heme. It is also shown that the repression of HEM13 transcription caused by heme involves the HAP1 and ROX1 gene products; a mutation in either gene results in derepression of HEM13 expression. The heme-dependent expression of ROX1 was found to require functional HAP1, leading one to propose that repression of HEM13 results from a pathway involving HAP1-mediated regulation of ROX1 transcription in response to heme levels followed by ROX1-mediated repression of HEM13 transcription. In support of this model, expression of ROX1 under control of the GAL promoter was found to result in repression of HEM13 transcription in a hap1 mutant strain. The ability of ROX1 encoded by the galactose-inducible ROX1 construct to function in the absence of HAP1 indicates that the only role of HAP1 in repression of HEM13 is to activate ROX1 transcription."
89,Frontiers in genetics ,34434221; ,"Several key genes governing Zn homeostasis and grain zinc content (GZC) have been functionally characterized. However, the effects of these genes in diverse breeding populations have not been evaluated; thus, their availability in breeding is unclear. In this study, the effects of 65 genes related to rice zinc responses on GZC were evaluated using two panels of breeding lines, and the superior haplotypes were identified. One panel consisted of mega varieties from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), South Asia, and Southeast Asia (SEA), and the other panel is breeding lines/varieties from South China (SC). In addition, a multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population, named as DC1, was also employed. Three analytical methods, single-locus mixed linear model (SL-MLM), multilocus random-SNP-effect mixed linear model (mrMLM), and haplotype-based association analysis (Hap-AA), were applied. OsIDEF1 (which explained 12.3% of the phenotypic variance) and OsZIFL7 (8.3-9.1%), OsZIP7 (18.9%), and OsIRT1 (17.9%) were identified by SL-MLM in SEA and SC, respectively, whereas no gene was significantly associated with GZC in DC1. In total, five (OsNRAMP6, OsYSL15, OsIRT1, OsIDEF1, and OsZIFL7, 7.70-15.39%), three (OsFRDL1, OsIRT1, and OsZIP7, 11.87-17.99%), and two (OsYSL7 and OsZIP7, 9.85-10.57%) genes were detected to be significantly associated with GZC in SEA, SC, and DC1 by mrMLM, respectively. Hap-AA indicated that Hap1-OsNRAMP5, Hap5-OsZIP4, Hap1-OsIRT1, Hap3-OsNRAMP6, Hap6-OsMTP1, and Hap6-OsYSL15 had the largest effects for GZC in SEA, whereas Hap3-OsOPT7, Hap4-OsIRT2, Hap4-OsZIP7, Hap5-OsIRT1, and Hap5-OsSAMS1 were the most significant in the SC population. Besides, superior alleles were also identified for the significant genes. The genes significantly associated with GZC and their superior haplotypes identified in different panels could be used in enhancing GZC through molecular breeding, which could further address the problem of Zn malnutrition among rice consumers."
90,The EMBO journal ,8458333; ,"Previously, it was shown that the CYP1(HAP1) gene product mediates the transcription of several oxygen-regulated genes through a metabolic co-effector, heme, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This study investigates the overproduction of the CYP1 protein when the CYP1(HAP1) gene is placed under the control of the GAL10-CYC1 hybrid promoter (either at the locus of the CYP1(HAP1) gene or cloned in a high-copy-number plasmid). In these conditions, the CYP1 protein is detected by Western blot analysis and has a molecular mass in agreement with the open reading frame sequence. Band-shift experiments show that the CYP1(HAP1) protein is able to interact specifically with its target sequences in vitro without addition of hemin, and forms a large complex with one or several unidentified factors denoted as X. Addition of hemin allows the formation of a new complex which has a lower molecular mass. The internal deletion of the seven repeated amino acid sequences containing the KCPVDH motif in the CYP1(HAP1) protein modifies the heme responsiveness phenomenon observed in vitro in the band-shift experiments and in vivo in the transcription of the CYB2, CYC1, CYP3(CYC7) and ERG11 genes. On the basis of these data, we propose a new model for heme-induced activation of the CYP1 protein."

We show here that strains derived from S288c carry a defective Ty1 element inserted in the 3' region of the HAP1 ORF. This mutant allele acts as a HAP1 null allele in terms of cytochrome c expression and CYC1 UAS1-dependent transcription, but is able to sustain limited growth in heme-depleted conditions."
92,The Journal of clinical investigation ,21985783; ,"Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder. It is caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in the first exon of the huntingtin (HTT) gene that encodes a mutant HTT protein with a polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion at the amino terminus. Here, we demonstrate that WT HTT regulates ciliogenesis by interacting through huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) with pericentriolar material 1 protein (PCM1). Loss of Htt in mouse cells impaired the retrograde trafficking of PCM1 and thereby reduced primary cilia formation. In mice, deletion of Htt in ependymal cells led to PCM1 mislocalization, alteration of the cilia layer, and hydrocephalus. Pathogenic polyQ expansion led to centrosomal accumulation of PCM1 and abnormally long primary cilia in mouse striatal cells. PCM1 accumulation in ependymal cells was associated with longer cilia and disorganized cilia layers in a mouse model of HD and in HD patients. Longer cilia resulted in alteration of the cerebrospinal fluid flow. Thus, our data indicate that WT HTT is essential for protein trafficking to the centrosome and normal ciliogenesis. In HD, hypermorphic ciliogenesis may affect signaling and neuroblast migration so as to dysregulate brain homeostasis and exacerbate disease progression."
93,European journal of biochemistry ,7758459; ,"Expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae AAC2 gene encoding the major mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier was examined. The intracellular level of the carrier protein, as well as the level of the AAC2-gene-specific mRNA, is influenced by the presence or absence of oxygen or of heme, and it is subject to carbon-source control. In addition, the expression of AAC2 gene requires the products of the HAP2 and HAP3 genes, but not that of the HAP1 gene. The 5'-flanking region of the gene was isolated, sequenced and fused to the lacZ reporter gene in order to study the effect of carbon sources and of specific deletion mutations on expression of the gene in yeast transformants. The expression of the reporter gene reveals that the AAC2 gene possesses a strong inducible promoter. The promoter analysis, combined with expression studies in the wild-type as well as in various mutant strains, identified an upstream activation site (UAS) contained within a sequence between -393 bp and -268 bp, and several major initiation sites of AAC2 mRNA between -105bp and -95 bp. Deletion analysis also shows that the TATA boxes located 45 bp and 104 bp upstream of the 5'-ends of AAC2 mRNA are not essential for the transcription. The UAS of the AAC2 gene is required for activation by HAP2 and heme and for release from glucose repressin. A restriction fragment containing the UAS conferred oxygen and carbon source regulation when placed upstream of another yeast gene encoding ADP/ATP carrier (AAC3), deleted of its regulatory sequences. The UAS of the AAC2 gene contains at least two distinct motifs for DNA-binding transcriptional activators, including one which is identical with the core HAP2/3/4 binding motif, and a second one with the ABF1 consensus binding sequence. Our results indicate that these sequences mediate the effects of the respective transactivator on the oxygen- and carbon-source-dependent transcription of the AAC2 gene."
94,Molecular ecology resources ,34601821; ,"The cotton-melon aphid Aphis gossypii is a sap-sucking insect that is considered a serious global pest. The species is distributed over a large geographical range and uses a wide variety of hosts, with some populations being specialized to attack different plant species. Here, we provide de novo chromosome-level genome assemblies of a cotton specialist population (Hap1) and a cucurbit specialist population (Hap3). We achieved this by using a combination of third-generation sequencing platforms, namely Illumina and Hi-C sequencing technologies. We were able to anchor a total of 334.89 Mb (scaffold N50 of 89.13 Mb) and 359.95 Mb (scaffold N50 of 68.88 Mb) to four chromosomes for Hap1 and Hap3, respectively. Moreover, our results showed that the X-chromosome of Hap3 (113.01 Mb) was significantly longer than that of Hap1 (100.26 Mb), with a high level of sequence conservation between the aphid species. We also report variation in the number of protein-coding genes and repeat sequences between Hap1 and Hap3. In particular, olfactory and gustatory receptor genes underwent a high level of gene duplication and expansion events in A. gossypii, including between Hap1 and Hap3. Moreover, we identified two glutathione S-transferase genes which underwent single gene duplications in Hap3, and tandem duplication and inversion events affecting the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase between Hap1 and Hap3, all of which include the CYP3 family. Our results illustrate the variance in the genomic composition of two specialized A. gossypii populations and provide a helpful resource for the study of aphid population evolution, host adaption and insecticide resistance."
95,Molecular and cellular biology ,2046677; ,"Expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene encoding cytochrome b2 (EC 1.2.2.3), CYB2, was investigated by direct analysis of mRNA transcripts and by measurement of the expression of lacZ fused to the CYB2 control regions. These studies indicated that regulation of the CYB2 gene is subject to several metabolic controls at the transcriptional level: inhibition due to glucose fermentation, induction by lactate, and inhibition in anaerobiosis or in absence of heme biosynthesis. Furthermore, we have shown that the CYB2 promoter contains one cis negative regulatory region and two heme-dependent positive regions, one of which is controlled by the transcriptional regulator CYP1 (HAP1) which is involved in the modulation of the expression of several oxygen-regulated genes. The CYP1 (HAP1)-binding sequence was located by gel retardation and DNase I footprinting experiments and compared with the binding sequences previously characterized in detail (UAS1CYC1, UAS'CYP3 (CYC7), and UASCTT1)."

The Zn(II)2Cys6 (or C6 zinc) binuclear cluster DNA binding domain has thus far been identified exclusively in fungal proteins, generally transcriptional regulators, and there are more than 80 known or predicted proteins which contain this motif, the best characterized of which are GAL4, PPR1, LEU3, HAP1, LAC9, and PUT3. Here we review all known proteins containing the Zn(II)2Cys6 motif, along with their function, DNA binding, dimerization, and zinc(II) coordination properties and DNA binding sites. In addition, we have identified all of the Zn(II)2Cys6 motif-containing proteins in the sequence databases, including a large number with unknown function from the completed Saccharomyces cerevisiae and ongoing Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome projects, and examined the phylogenetic relationships of all the Zn(II)2Cys6 motifs from these proteins.

This gene plays an important role in the regulation of lipid metabolism, cellular growth, and metabolism in mammals. Here, potential polymorphisms were sought in the bovine SIRT4 gene, and the relationships between the detected polymorphisms and carcass quality in Qinchuan cattle were assessed. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the promoter region of the SIRT4 gene from the sequencing results of 452 individual cattle. A total of 8 different haplotypes were identified. Of these, the 3 most frequently observed haplotypes had frequencies of 35.0% (-CTG-), 18.3% (-CTA-), and 12.9% (-CCG-). The frequencies of g.-311C > T, g.-771C > T, and g.-1022G > A conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in all the samples (chi-square test, P < 0.05). The association analysis indicated that these 3 polymorphisms were significantly associated with subcutaneous fat depth and intramuscular fat content (at P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). Interestingly, the Hap1/2 (-CAG-CAA-) diplotype was more highly associated with desirable ultrasound than other haplotype combinations."

In this study, a homolog of MIF was identified in the clam Meretrix meretrix. Ten SNPs in the DNA partial sequence of MmMIF were found to be significantly associated with Vibrio resistance (P < 0.05). Distinct expression patterns of MmMIF among different haplotypes were observed after Vibrio challenge. The results showed that haplotypes did not affect MmMIF expression in the negative control group, while the expression of MmMIF in clams with Hap1 and Hap1/Hap2 was significantly lower than that with Hap2 at 24 h in the PBS-injected group but significantly higher than that with Hap2 in the Vibrio-injected group. The results also indicate that Hap1 and Hap1/Hap2 can specifically respond to mechanical stimulation while Hap2 can specifically respond to Vibrio infection. The effect of a missense mutation was detected by site-directed mutagenesis using fusion expression of the protein, which showed that the SNP g.737 (I > V) has no effect on redox activity and tautomerase activity. These studies identified a potential marker that is enriched in Vibrio-resistant clams that can be used for the genetic breeding of Meretrix meretrix."
