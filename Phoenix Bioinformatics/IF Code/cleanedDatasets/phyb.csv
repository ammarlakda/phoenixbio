2,Cells ,36497048; ,"Seed germination is essential for the colonization of the land plants. Light is a major environmental factor affecting seed germination, which is predominantly regulated by photoreceptor phytochrome B (PHYB). PHYB is activated by red light (designated as PHYB-on) whereas it is inactivated by far-red light (referred as PHYB-off). We previously reported that Arabidopsis histone deacetylase HDA15 interacts with phytochrome-interacting factor1 (PIF1) to repress seed germination under PHYB-off conditions. Here, we show that HDA15 plays a negative role in regulating seed germination under PHYB-on conditions. Overexpression of HDA15 in Arabidopsis restrains PHYB-dependent seed germination, while gibberellin (GA) relieves the repressive role of HDA15 under PHYB-off conditions. We further show that HDA15 directly binds to GA20ox1 and GA20ox2, two key GA biosynthesis genes and represses their expression by removal of histone H3 and H4 acetylation. Moreover, the levels of HDA15 transcript and HDA15 protein are up-regulated in the phyB mutant. Collectively, our work proposes that HDA15 acts as a negative regulator of PHYB-dependent seed germination by directly repressing GA20ox1/2 gene expression.",PMC9735612
3,Frontiers in plant science ,36161012; ,"Arabidopsis thaliana shows a wide range of natural genetic variation in light responses. Shade avoidance syndrome is a strategy of major adaptive significance that includes seed germination, elongation of vegetative structures, leaf hyponasty, and acceleration of flowering. Previously, we found that the southernmost Arabidopsis accession, collected in the south of Patagonia (Pat), is hyposensitive to light and displays a reduced response to shade light. This work aimed to explore the genetic basis of the shade avoidance response (SAR) for hypocotyl growth by QTL mapping in a recently developed 162 RIL population between Col-0 and Pat. We mapped four QTL for seedling hypocotyl growth: WL1 and WL2 QTL in white light, SHADE1 QTL in shade light, and SAR1 QTL for the SAR. PHYB is the strongest candidate gene for SAR1 QTL. Here we studied the function of two polymorphic indels in the promoter region, a GGGR deletion, and three non-synonymous polymorphisms on the PHYB coding region compared with the Col-0 reference genome. To decipher the contribution and relevance of each PHYB-Pat polymorphism, we constructed transgenic lines with single or double polymorphisms by using Col-0 as a reference genome. We found that single polymorphisms in the coding region of PHYB have discrete functions in seed germination, seedling development, and shade avoidance response. These results suggest distinct functions for each PHYB polymorphism to the adjustment of plant development to variable light conditions.",PMC9490419
4,EMBO reports ,34018302; ,"Iron (Fe) deficiency affects global crop productivity and human health. However, the role of light signaling in plant Fe uptake remains uncharacterized. Here, we find that light-induced Fe uptake in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is largely dependent on phytochrome B (phyB). Light induces the phyB-dependent accumulation of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) protein both in the leaves and roots. HY5 movement from shoots to roots activates the expression of FER transcription factor, leading to the accumulation of transcripts involved in Fe uptake. Mutation in FER abolishes the light quality-induced changes in Fe uptake. The low Fe uptake observed in phyB, hy5, and fer mutants is accompanied by lower photosynthetic electron transport rates. Exposure to red light at night increases Fe accumulation in wild-type fruit but has little effects on fruit of phyB mutants. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Fe uptake is systemically regulated by light in a phyB-HY5-FER-dependent manner. These findings provide new insights how the manipulation of light quality could be used to improve Fe uptake and hence the nutritional quality of crops.",PMC8406400
6,Frontiers in plant science ,35222493; ,"Light-triggered transcriptome reprogramming is critical for promoting photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis seedlings. Nonetheless, recent studies have shed light on the importance of alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) in photomorphogenesis. The splicing factors splicing factor for phytochrome signaling (SFPS) and reduced red-light responses in cry1cry2 background1 (RRC1) are involved in the phytochrome B (phyB) signaling pathway and promote photomorphogenesis by controlling pre-mRNA splicing of light- and clock-related genes. However, splicing factors that serve as repressors in phyB signaling pathway remain unreported. Here, we report that the splicing factor SWELLMAP 2 (SMP2) suppresses photomorphogenesis in the light. SMP2 physically interacts with phyB and colocalizes with phyB in photobodies after light exposure. Genetic analyses show that SMP2 antagonizes phyB signaling to promote hypocotyl elongation in the light. The homologs of SMP2 in yeast and human belong to second-step splicing factors required for proper selection of the 3' splice site (3'SS) of an intron. Notably, SMP2 reduces the abundance of the functional REVEILLE 8 a (RVE8a) form, probably by determining the 3'SS, and thereby inhibits RVE8-mediated transcriptional activation of clock genes containing evening elements (EE). Finally, SMP2-mediated reduction of functional RVE8 isoform promotes phytochrome interacting factor 4 (PIF4) expression to fine-tune hypocotyl elongation in the light. Taken together, our data unveil a phyB-interacting splicing factor that negatively regulates photomorphogenesis, providing additional information for further mechanistic investigations regarding phyB-controlled AS of light- and clock-related genes.",PMC8867171
11,aBIOTECH ,36304757; ,"phytochrome B (phyB) acts as the red light photoreceptor and negatively regulates the growth-promoting factor PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING 4 (PIF4) through a direct physical interaction, which in turn changes the expression of a large number of genes. phyB-PIF4 module regulates a variety of biological and developmental processes in plants. In this study, we demonstrate that B-BOX PROTEIN 11 (BBX11) physically interacts with both phyB and PIF4. BBX11 negatively regulates PIF4 accumulation as well as its biochemical activity, consequently leading to the repression of PIF4-controlled genes' expression and promotion of photomorphogenesis in the prolonged red light. This study reveals a regulatory mechanism that mediates red light signal transduction and sheds a light on phyB-PIF4 module in promoting red light-dependent photomorphognenesis.",PMC9590482
12,Nature communications ,31527679; ,"CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) is a highly conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase from plants to animals and acts as a central repressor of photomorphogenesis in plants. SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 1 family members (SPA1-SPA4) directly interact with COP1 and enhance COP1 activity. Despite the presence of a kinase domain at the N-terminus, no COP1-independent role of SPA proteins has been reported. Here we show that SPA1 acts as a serine/threonine kinase and directly phosphorylates PIF1 in vitro and in vivo. SPAs are necessary for the light-induced phosphorylation, ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PIF1. Moreover, the red/far-red light photoreceptor phyB interacts with SPA1 through its C-terminus and enhances the recruitment of PIF1 for phosphorylation. These data provide a mechanistic view on how the COP1-SPA complexes serve as an example of a cognate kinase-E3 ligase complex that selectively triggers rapid phosphorylation and removal of its substrates, and how phyB modulates this process to promote photomorphogenesis.",PMC6746701
13,Nature ,35355010; ,"Many aspects of plant photoperception are mediated by the phytochrome (Phy) family of bilin-containing photoreceptors that reversibly interconvert between inactive Pr and active Pfr conformers1,2. Despite extensive biochemical studies, full understanding of plant Phy signalling has remained unclear due to the absence of relevant 3D models. Here we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of Arabidopsis PhyB in the Pr state that reveals a topologically complex dimeric organization that is substantially distinct from its prokaryotic relatives. Instead of an anticipated parallel architecture, the C-terminal histidine-kinase-related domains (HKRDs) associate head-to-head, whereas the N-terminal photosensory regions associate head-to-tail to form a parallelogram-shaped platform with near two-fold symmetry. The platform is internally linked by the second of two internal Per/Arnt/Sim domains that binds to the photosensory module of the opposing protomer and a preceding 'modulator' loop that assembles tightly with the photosensory module of its own protomer. Both connections accelerate the thermal reversion of Pfr back to Pr, consistent with an inverse relationship between dimer assembly and Pfr stability. Lopsided contacts between the HKRDs and the platform create profound asymmetry to PhyB that might imbue distinct signalling potentials to the protomers. We propose that this unique structural dynamism creates an extensive photostate-sensitive surface for conformation-dependent interactions between plant Phy photoreceptors and their signalling partners.",PMC9930725
14,Nature communications ,32103019; ,"In plants, an elevation in ambient temperature induces adaptive morphological changes including elongated hypocotyls, which is predominantly regulated by a bHLH transcription factor, PIF4. Although PIF4 is expressed in all aerial tissues including the epidermis, mesophyll, and vascular bundle, its tissue-specific functions in thermomorphogenesis are not known. Here, we show that epidermis-specific expression of PIF4 induces constitutive long hypocotyls, while vasculature-specific expression of PIF4 has no effect on hypocotyl growth. RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR analyses reveal that auxin-responsive genes and growth-related genes are highly activated by epidermal, but not by vascular, PIF4. Additionally, inactivation of epidermal PIF4 or auxin signaling, and overexpression of epidermal phyB suppresses thermoresponsive growth, indicating that epidermal PIF4-auxin pathways are essential for the temperature responses. Further, we show that high temperatures increase both epidermal PIF4 transcription and the epidermal PIF4 DNA-binding ability. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the epidermis regulates thermoresponsive growth through the phyB-PIF4-auxin pathway.",PMC7044213
16,"Development (Cambridge, England) ",32994167; ,"High ambient temperature attributable to global warming has a profound influence on plant growth and development at all stages of the life cycle. The response of plants to high ambient temperature, termed thermomorphogenesis, is characterized by hypocotyl and petiole elongation and hyponastic growth at the seedling stage. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanism of thermomorphogenesis is still rudimentary. Here, we show that a set of four SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 (SPA) genes is required for thermomorphogenesis. Consistently, SPAs are necessary for global changes in gene expression in response to high ambient temperature. In the spaQ mutant at high ambient temperature, the level of SPA1 is unaffected, whereas the thermosensor phytochrome B (phyB) is stabilized. Furthermore, in the absence of four SPA genes, the pivotal transcription factor PIF4 fails to accumulate, indicating a role of SPAs in regulating the phyB-PIF4 module at high ambient temperature. SPA1 directly phosphorylates PIF4 in vitro, and a mutant SPA1 affecting the kinase activity fails to rescue the PIF4 level in addition to the thermo-insensitive phenotype of spaQ, suggesting that the SPA1 kinase activity is necessary for thermomorphogenesis. Taken together, these data suggest that SPAs are new components that integrate light and temperature signaling by fine-tuning the phyB-PIF4 module.",PMC7561471
17,BMC plant biology ,32600268; ,"Photoperiod signals provide important cues by which plants regulate their growth and development in response to predictable seasonal changes. Phytochromes, a family of red and far-red light receptors, play critical roles in regulating flowering time in response to changing photoperiods.

20,International journal of molecular sciences ,28587227; ,"The influence of temperature on plants is essential. However, our knowledge on the intricate regulation process underlying heat stress (HS) response in plants is limited. Recently, information about thermal sensors in vivo has begun to emerge. In this study, another primary environmental stimulus, light, was verified once again to work with temperature synergistically on plants, through the modulation of numerous biological processes. With the application of transcriptomic analysis, a substantial number of heat-responsive genes were detected involved in both light- and phytohormone-mediated pathways in Arabidopsis. During this process, phytoreceptor phyB acts as a molecular switch to turn on or turn off several other genes HS response, under different light conditions. Furthermore, a morphological study showed the afunction of phyB enhanced plants thermal tolerance, confirming the important role of this phytochrome in temperature perception and response in plants. This study adds data to the picture of light and temperature signaling cross-talk in plants, which is important for the exploration of complicated HS responses or light-mediated mechanisms. Furthermore, based on its influence on Arabidopsis thermal response in both morphological and physiological levels, phyB is a photoreceptor, as revealed before, as well as an essential thermal sensor in plants.",PMC5486017
23,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America ,31776262; ,"Phytochrome B (phyB) absorbs red light signals and subsequently initiates a set of molecular events in plant cells to promote photomorphogenesis. Here we show that phyB directly interacts with B-BOX CONTAINING PROTEIN 4 (BBX4), a positive regulator of red light signaling, and positively controls its abundance in red light. BBX4 associates with PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3 (PIF3) and represses PIF3 transcriptional activation activity and PIF3-controlled gene expression. The degradation of BBX4 in darkness is dependent on CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) and the 26S proteasome system. Collectively, BBX4 acts as a key component of the phyB-PIF3-mediated signaling module and fine tunes the red light action. phyB promotes the accumulation of BBX4, which in turn serves to repress PIF3 action through direct physical interaction to promote photomorphogenic development in red light.",PMC6925995
24,Plant communications ,35529947; ,"WRKY transcription factors are known mostly for their function in plant defense, abiotic stress responses, senescence, seed germination, and development of the pollen, embryo, and seed. Here, we report the regulatory functions of two WRKY proteins in photomorphogenesis and PIF4 expression. PIF4 is a critical signaling hub in light, temperature, and hormonal signaling pathways. Either its expression or its accumulation peaks in the morning and afternoon. WRKY2 and WRKY10 form heterodimers and recognize their target site in the PIF4 promoter near the MYB element that is bound by CCA1 and LHY under red and blue light. WRKY2 and WRKY10 interact directly with CCA1/LHY to enhance their targeting but interact indirectly with SHB1. The two WRKY proteins also interact with phyB, and their interaction enhances the targeting of CCA1 and LHY to the PIF4 promoter. SHB1 associates with the WRKY2 and WRKY10 loci and enhances their expression in parallel with the PIF4 expression peaks. This forward regulatory loop further sustains the accumulation of the two WRKY proteins and the targeting of CCA1/LHY to the PIF4 locus. In summary, interactions of two WRKY proteins with CCA1/LHY and phyB maintain an optimal expression level of PIF4 toward noon and afternoon, which is essential to sketch the circadian pattern of PIF4 expression.",PMC9073327

29,Plant physiology ,28188273; ,"Circadian rhythm of stomatal aperture is mainly regulated by light/darkness. Blue and red light induce stomatal opening through different mechanisms that are mediated by special receptors. ROP2, a member of Rho GTPase family in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsisthaliana), has been found to negatively regulate light-induced stomatal opening. However, the upstream guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) RopGEFs have not been revealed, and it is unclear which photoreceptor is required for the action of RopGEFs-ROPs. Here, we showed that RopGEF2 acted as a negative regulator in phytochrome B (phyB)-mediated red light-induced stomatal opening. Meanwhile, ROP7, another member of ROP family, acting redundantly with ROP2, was regulated by RopGEF2 in this process. RopGEF2 interacted with ROP7 and ROP2 and enhanced their intrinsic nucleotide exchange rates. Furthermore, the direct interactions between phyB and RopGEF2 were detected in vitro and in plants, and phyB enhanced the GEF activity of RopGEF2 toward both ROP7 and ROP2 under light. In addition, RopGEF4 functioned redundantly with RopGEF2 in red light-induced stomatal opening by activating both ROP7 and ROP2, and RopGEF2/RopGEF4 acted genetically downstream of phyB; however, the GEF activity of RopGEF4 was not directly enhanced by phyB. These results revealed that red light-activated phyB enhances the GEF activities of RopGEF2 and RopGEF4 directly or indirectly, and then activate both ROP7 and ROP2 in guard cells. The negative mechanism triggered by phyB prevents the excessive stomatal opening under red light.",PMC5462004
30,PloS one ,31233537; ,"The integration of conflicting signals in response to environmental constraints is essential to efficient plant growth and development. The light-dependent and the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent signaling pathways play opposite roles in many aspects of plant development. While these pathways have been extensively studied, the complex nature of their molecular dialogue is still obscure. When mobilized by the Arabidopsis thaliana β-glucosidase 1 (AtBG1), the glucose ester-conjugated inactive form of ABA has proven to be a source of the active hormone that is essential for the adaptation of the plant to water deficit, as evidenced by the impaired stomatal closure of atbg1 mutants in response to water stress. In a suppressor screen designed to identify the molecular components of AtBG1-associated physiological and developmental mechanisms, we identified the mutation variant of AtBG1 traits (vat1), a new mutant allele of the red light/far-red light photoreceptor PHYTOCHROME B (PHYB). Our study reveals that atbg1 plants harbor increased stomatal density in addition to impaired stomatal closure. We also provide evidence that the vat1/phyb mutation can restore the apparent transpiration of the atbg1 mutant by decreasing stomatal aperture and restoring a stomatal density similar to wild-type plants. Expression of key regulators of stomatal development showed a crosstalk between AtBG1-mediated ABA signaling and PHYB-mediated stomatal development. We conclude that the AtBG1-dependent regulation of ABA homeostasis and the PHYB-mediated light signaling pathways act antagonistically in the control of stomatal development.",PMC6590796
33,Scientific reports ,28743949; ,"Phytochromes are the main plant photoreceptors regulating multiple developmental processes. However, the regulatory network of phytochrome-mediated plant reproduction has remained largely unexplored. There are three phytochromes in rice, phyA, phyB and phyC. No changes in fertility are observed in the single mutants, whereas the seed-setting rate of the phyA phyB double mutant is significantly reduced. Histological and cytological analyses showed that the reduced fertility of the phyA phyB mutant was due to defects in both anther and pollen development. The four anther lobes in the phyA phyB mutant were developed at different stages with fewer pollen grains, most of which were aborted. At the mature stage, more than one lobe in the double mutant was just consisted of several cell layers. To identify genes involved in phytochrome-mediated anther development, anther transcriptomes of phyA, phyB and phyA phyB mutants were compared to that of wild-type rice respectively. Analysis of 2,241 double-mutant-specific differentially expressed transcripts revealed that the metabolic profiles, especially carbohydrate metabolism, were altered greatly, and heat-shock responses were activated in the double mutant. This study firstly provides valuable insight into the complex regulatory networks underlying phytochrome-mediated anther and pollen development in plants, and offers novel clues for hybrid rice breeding.",PMC5527001
37,Frontiers in plant science ,26074936; ,"Phytochrome B (phyB), a member of the phytochrome family in rice, plays important roles in regulating a range of developmental processes and stress responses. However, little information about the mechanisms involved in the phyB-mediated light signaling pathway has been reported in rice. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) also perform important roles in plant development and stress responses. Thus, it is intriguing to explore the role of miRNAs in the phyB-mediated light signaling pathway in rice. In this study, comparative high-throughput sequencing and degradome analysis were used to identify candidate miRNAs and their targets that participate in the phyB-mediated light signaling pathway. A total of 720 known miRNAs, 704 novel miRNAs and 1957 target genes were identified from the fourth leaves of wild-type (WT) and phyB mutant rice at the five-leaf stage. Among them, 135 miRNAs showed differential expression, suggesting that the expression of these miRNAs is directly or indirectly under the control of phyB. In addition, 32 out of the 135 differentially expressed miRNAs were found to slice 70 genes in the rice genome. Analysis of these target genes showed that members of various transcription factor families constituted the largest proportion, indicating miRNAs are probably involved in the phyB-mediated light signaling pathway mainly by regulating the expression of transcription factors. Our results provide new clues for functional characterization of miRNAs in the phyB-mediated light signaling pathway, which should be helpful in comprehensively uncovering the molecular mechanisms of phytochrome-mediated photomorphogenesis and stress responses in plants.",PMC4448008
38,International journal of molecular sciences ,26030677; ,"It has been reported that Arabidopsis phytochrome (phy) A and phyB are crucial photoreceptors that display synergistic and antagonistic action during seedling de-etiolation in multiple light signaling pathways. However, the functional relationship between phyA and phyB is not fully understood under different kinds of light and in response to different intensities of such light. In this work, we compared hypocotyl elongation of the phyA-211 phyB-9 double mutant with the wild type, the phyA-211 and phyB-9 single mutants under different intensities of far-red (FR), red (R), blue (B) and white (W) light. We confirmed that phyA and phyB synergistically promote seedling de-etiolation in B-, B plus R-, W- and high R-light conditions. The correlation of endogenous ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) protein levels with the trend of hypocotyl elongation of all lines indicate that both phyA and phyB promote seedling photomorphogenesis in a synergistic manner in high-irradiance white light.

39,Plant diversity ,35281129; ,"The phytochrome B mediated light signaling integrates with various phytohormone signalings to control plant immune response. However, it is still unclear whether phyB-mediated light signaling has an effect on the biosynthesis of jasmonate during plant defense response against Botrytis cinerea. In this study, we demonstrated that phyB-mediated light signaling has a role in this process. Initially, we confirmed that phyb plants were obviously less resistant to B. cinerea while phyB overexpressing plants showed significantly enhanced resistance. We also found that the expression of numerous JA biosynthesis genes was promoted upon treatment with red or white light when compared to that of darkness, and that this promotion is dependent on phyB. Consistent with the gene expression results, phyb plants accumulated reduced pool of JA-Ile, indicating that phyB-mediated light signaling indeed increased JA biosynthesis. Further genetic analysis showed that light-mediated JAZ9 degradation and phyB-enhanced resistance were dependent on the receptor COI1, and that pif1/3/4/5 (pifq) can largely rescue the severe symptom of phyb. Taken together, our study demonstrates that phyB may participate in plant defense against B. cinerea through the modulation of the biosynthesis of JA.",PMC8897165

In a screen for Arabidopsis mutants with phenotypes similar to those of phyB mutants, we isolated two new elf3 mutants. One has weaker morphological phenotypes than previously identified elf3 alleles, but still abolishes circadian rhythms under continuous light. Like phyB mutants, elf3 mutants have elongated hypocotyls and petioles, flower early, and have defects in the red light response. However, we found that elf3 mutations have an additive interaction with a phyB null mutation, with phyA or hy4 null mutations, or with a PHYB overexpression construct, and that an elf3 mutation does not prevent nuclear localization of phyB. These results suggest that either there is substantial redundancy in phyB and elf3 function, or the two genes regulate distinct signaling pathways.",PMC58949
44,Plant physiology ,26893475; ,"Phytochrome B (phyB) enables plants to modify shoot branching or tillering in response to varying light intensities and ratios of red and far-red light caused by shading and neighbor proximity. Tillering is inhibited in sorghum genotypes that lack phytochrome B (58M, phyB-1) until after floral initiation. The growth of tiller buds in the first leaf axil of wild-type (100M, PHYB) and phyB-1 sorghum genotypes is similar until 6 d after planting when buds of phyB-1 arrest growth, while wild-type buds continue growing and develop into tillers. Transcriptome analysis at this early stage of bud development identified numerous genes that were up to 50-fold differentially expressed in wild-type/phyB-1 buds. Up-regulation of terminal flower1, GA2oxidase, and TPPI could protect axillary meristems in phyB-1 from precocious floral induction and decrease bud sensitivity to sugar signals. After bud growth arrest in phyB-1, expression of dormancy-associated genes such as DRM1, GT1, AF1, and CKX1 increased and ENOD93, ACCoxidase, ARR3/6/9, CGA1, and SHY2 decreased. Continued bud outgrowth in wild-type was correlated with increased expression of genes encoding a SWEET transporter and cell wall invertases. The SWEET transporter may facilitate Suc unloading from the phloem to the apoplast where cell wall invertases generate monosaccharides for uptake and utilization to sustain bud outgrowth. Elevated expression of these genes was correlated with higher levels of cytokinin/sugar signaling in growing buds of wild-type plants.",PMC4824614

The overexpressors of GmPHYB1 behaved similarly to those of AtPHYB, but with some subtle differences with respect to the acceleration of flowering under short day conditions and the growth of the hypocotyl under certain light fluence rate.

48,Plant physiology ,9276958; ,"We examined the photocontrol of seed germination in the phyA/phyB double mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana seeds. Dormant phyA/phyB seeds showed a red/far-red light (R/FR)-reversible induction of seed germination. This suggests the involvement of at least one other phytochrome, phyC, D, and/or E, in controlling seed germination. We designated this spectrally active phytochrome in phyA/phyB as phyX. The full reversibility of the R-induced germination by subsequent FR pulses, and the observation that the response is reversible by FR, even after a 3-h R treatment, indicates that this phyX response belongs to the low-fluence-response type. Thus, this phyX response is functionally related to phyB-mediated responses. However, in contrast to phyB-controlled seed germination, this phyX-mediated response needs a prolonged imbibition period and exhibits reversibility kinetics different from that needed for phyB. Furthermore, this phyX response requires a prolonged irradiation time and shows a fluence rate response dependency, showing a similarity to the high irradiance response of photomorphogenesis. Thus, phyX, with regard to its control of seed germination, is a functionally new phytochrome that shares some characteristics of both phyA- and phyB-mediated responses.",PMC158442
49,The Plant cell ,35478037; ,"Plant thermosensors help optimize plant development and architecture for ambient temperatures, and morphogenic adaptation to warm temperatures has been extensively studied in recent years. Phytochrome B (phyB)-mediated thermosensing and the gene regulatory networks governing thermomorphogenic responses are well understood at the molecular level. However, it is unknown how plants manage their responsiveness to fluctuating temperatures in inducing thermomorphogenic behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1 (SMAX1), known as a karrikin signaling repressor, enhances the thermosensitivity of hypocotyl morphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Hypocotyl thermomorphogenesis was largely disrupted in SMAX1-deficient mutants. SMAX1 interacts with phyB to alleviate its suppressive effects on the transcription factor activity of PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4), promoting hypocotyl thermomorphogenesis. Interestingly, the SMAX1 protein is slowly destabilized at warm temperatures, preventing hypocotyl overgrowth. Our findings indicate that the thermodynamic control of SMAX1 abundance serves as a molecular gatekeeper for phyB function in thermosensitizing PIF4-mediated hypocotyl morphogenesis.",PMC9252492
50,Plant signaling & behavior ,21822060; ,"Photoperiodic flowering in Arabidopsis is controlled not only by floral activators such as GI, CO, and FT, but also by repressors such as SVP and FLC. Double mutations in LHY and CCA1 (lhy;cca1) accelerated flowering under short days, mainly by the GI-CO dependent pathway. In contrast, lhy;cca1 showed delayed flowering under continuous light (LL), probably due to the GI-CO independent pathway. This late-flowering phenotype was suppressed by svp, flc, and elf3. However, how SVP, FLC, and ELF3 mediate LHY/CCA1 and flowering time is not fully understood. We found that lhy;cca1 exhibited short hypocotyls and petioles under LL, but the molecular mechanism for these effects has not been elucidated. To address these questions, we performed a screen for mutations that suppress either or both of the lhy;cca1 phenotypes under LL, using two different approaches. We identified two novel mutations, a dominant (del1) and a recessive (phyB-2511) allele of phyB. The flowering times of single mutants of three phyB alleles, hy3-1, del1, and phyB-2511, are almost the same and earlier than those of wild-type plants. A similar level of acceleration of flowering time was observed in all three phyB mutants tested when combined with the late-flowering mutations co-2 and SVPox. However, the effect of phyB-2511 on lhy;cca1 was different from those by hy3-1 or del1. svp-3 did not strongly enhance the early-flowering phenotypes of phyB-2511 or del1. These results suggest that light signaling via PhyB may affect factors downstream of the clock proteins, controlling flowering time and organ elongation. phyB mutations with different levels of effects on lhy;cca1-dependent late flowering would be useful to determine a specific role for PHYB in the flowering pathway controlled by lhy;cca1 under LL.",PMC3260714
52,Genetics ,9611171; ,"Accumulating evidence indicates that individual members of the phytochrome family of photoreceptors have differential but interactive roles in controlling plant responses to light.

In phyB mutants, but not in phyA mutants, a four- to six-fold reduction in the level of phyC is observed in tissues grown either in the dark or in the light. Coordinate expression of phyB and phyC is induced in the phyB mutant background by the presence of a complementing PHYB transgene. However, in transgenic lines that overexpress phyB 15- to 20-fold, phyC is not similarly overexpressed.

In dark-grown seedlings, both promoters are 4-fold more active in shoots than in roots,but the PHYA promoter is nearly 20-fold more active than that of PHYB in both organs. In shoots, white light represses the activities of the PHYA and PHYB promoters 10- and 2-fold, respectively, whereas in roots light has no effect on the PHYA promoter but increases PHYB promoter activity 2-fold. Consequently, PHYA promoter activity remains higher than that of PHYB in light in both shoots (5-fold) and roots (11-fold). Experiments with narrow-waveband light and photomorphogenic mutants suggest that no single photoreceptor is necessary for full white-light-directed PHYA repression in shoots, but that multiple, independent photoreceptor pathways are sufficient alone or in combination. In contrast, phytochrome B appears both necessary and sufficient for a light-mediated decrease in PHYB activity in shoots, and phytochrome A mediates a far-red-light-stimulated increase in PHYB promoter activity. Together, the data indicate that the PHYA and PHYB genes are regulated in divergent fashion at the transcriptional level, both developmentally and by the spectral distribution of the prevailing light, and that this regulation may be important to the photosensory function of the two photoreceptors.",PMC157156

The cryptochrome and phytochrome signaling mechanisms interact directly with CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1), a RING motif-containing E3 ligase that acts to negatively regulate photomorphogenesis. COP1 interacts with and ubiquitinates the transcription factors that promote photomorphogenesis, such as ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 and LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED1 (HFR1), to inhibit photomorphogenic development. Here, we show that COP1 physically interacts with PIF3-LIKE1 (PIL1) and promotes PIL1 degradation via the 26S proteasome. We further demonstrate that phyB physically interacts with PIL1 and enhances PIL1 protein accumulation upon red light irradiation, probably through suppressing the COP1-PIL1 association. Biochemical and genetic studies indicate that PIL1 and HFR1 form heterodimers and promote photomorphogenesis cooperatively. Moreover, we demonstrate that PIL1 interacts with PIF1, 3, 4, and 5, resulting in the inhibition of the transcription of PIF direct-target genes. Our results reveal that PIL1 stability is regulated by phyB and COP1, likely through physical interactions, and that PIL1 coordinates with HFR1 to inhibit the transcriptional activity of PIFs, suggesting that PIL1, HFR1, and PIFs constitute a subset of antagonistic basic helix-loop-helix factors acting downstream of phyB and COP1 to regulate photomorphogenic development.",PMC4114944

The regulation of these chloroplast movements involves members of both the phototropin and phytochrome families of photoreceptors. Examination of fluence-rate response dependencies in phot1 and phot2 mutants revealed that although both photoreceptors are capable of inducing chloroplast accumulation under low-light conditions, the signals from these photoreceptors appear to be antagonistic. Chloroplast movements in wild-type plants were intermediate between those of the single phot mutants, consistent with each operating through separate signalling cascades. Mutants in phot2 showed transient chloroplast avoidance responses upon exposure to intense blue light, and slow but sustained chloroplast avoidance under intense white light, indicating that in the absence of phot2, phot1 is capable of generating both a low and a high-light response signal. Mutations in phytochrome B (phyB) caused an enhanced avoidance response at intermediate and high light intensities. Examination of phyB, phot1phyB, and phot2phyB mutants indicated that this enhancement is caused by PhyB inhibition of the high-light avoidance response in wild-type plants. In addition, our results suggest that the inhibition by PhyB is not exclusive to either of the phot1 or phot2 signalling pathways.",PMC2955749

We concluded that the cause of reduced root nodule formation in phyB mutants was the inhibition of JA-Ile production in root. Here we show that the shoot JA-Ile level of phyB mutants is higher than that of the wild-type strain MG20, suggesting that translocation of JA-Ile from shoot to root is impeded in the mutant. These results indicate that root nodule formation in phyB mutants is suppressed both by decreased JA-Ile production, caused by reduced JAR1 activity in root, and by reduced JA-Ile translocation from shoot to root.",PMC3583954
59,Molecular plant ,22492120; ,"The reversibly red (R)/far-red (FR)-light-responsive phytochrome (phy) photosensory system initiates both the deetiolation process in dark-germinated seedlings upon first exposure to light, and the shade-avoidance process in fully deetiolated seedlings upon exposure to vegetational shade. The intracellular signaling pathway from the light-activated photoreceptor conformer (Pfr) to the transcriptional network that drives these responses involves direct, physical interaction of Pfr with a small subfamily of bHLH transcription factors, termed Phy-Interacting Factors (PIFs), which induces rapid PIF proteolytic degradation. In addition, there is evidence of further complexity in light-grown seedlings, whereby phyB-PIF interaction reciprocally induces phyB degradation, in a mutually-negative, feedback-loop configuration. Here, to assess the relative contributions of these antagonistic activities to the net phenotypic readout in light-grown seedlings, we have examined the magnitude of the light- and simulated-shade-induced responses of a pentuple phyBpif1pif3pif4pif5 (phyBpifq) mutant and various multiple pif-mutant combinations. The data (1) reaffirm that phyB is the predominant, if not exclusive, photoreceptor imposing the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in deetiolating seedlings in response to prolonged continuous R irradiation and (2) show that the PIF quartet (PIF1, PIF3, PIF4, and PIF5) retain and exert a dual capacity to modulate hypocotyl elongation under these conditions, by concomitantly promoting cell elongation through intrinsic transcriptional-regulatory activity, and reducing phyB-inhibitory capacity through feedback-loop-induced phyB degradation. In shade-exposed seedlings, immunoblot analysis shows that the shade-imposed reduction in Pfr levels induces increases in the abundance of PIF3, and mutant analysis indicates that PIF3 acts, in conjunction with PIF4 and PIF5, to promote the known shade-induced acceleration of hypocotyl elongation. Conversely, although the quadruple pifq mutant displays clearly reduced hypocotyl elongation compared to wild-type in response to prolonged shade, immunoblot analysis detects no elevation in phyB levels in the mutant seedlings compared to the wild-type during the majority of the shade-induced growth period, and phyB levels are not robustly correlated with the growth phenotype across the pif-mutant combinations compared. These results suggest that PIF feedback modulation of phyB abundance does not play a dominant role in modulating the magnitude of the PIF-promoted, shade-responsive phenotype under these conditions. In seedlings grown under diurnal light-dark cycles, the data show that FR-pulse-induced removal of Pfr at the beginning of the dark period (End-of-Day-FR (EOD-FR) treatment) results in longer hypocotyls relative to no EOD-FR treatment and that this effect is attenuated in the pif-mutant combinations tested. This result similarly indicates that the PIF quartet members are capable of intrinsically promoting hypocotyl cell elongation in light-grown plants, independently of the effects of PIF feedback modulation of photoactivated-phyB abundance.",PMC3355348

Ferredoxin (Fd), the enzyme that most often supplies electrons to these reactions, is often overlooked when transplanting enzymes from one species to another because most cells already contain endogenous Fd. However, we have shown that the production of chromophores used in Phytochrome B (PhyB) optogenetics is greatly enhanced in mammalian cells by expressing bacterial and plant Fds with ferredoxin-NADP+ reductases (FNR). We delineated the rate limiting factors and found that the main metabolic precursor, heme, was not the primary limiting factor for producing either the cyanobacterial or plant chromophores, phycocyanobilin or phytochromobilin, respectively. In fact, Fd is limiting, followed by Fd+FNR and finally heme. Using these findings, we optimized the PCB production system and combined it with a tissue penetrating red/far-red sensing PhyB optogenetic gene switch in animal cells. We further characterized this system in several mammalian cell lines using red and far-red light. Importantly, we found that the light-switchable gene system remains active for several hours upon illumination, even with a short light pulse, and requires very small amounts of light for maximal activation. Boosting chromophore production by matching metabolic pathways with specific ferredoxin systems will enable the unparalleled use of the many PhyB optogenetic tools and has broader implications for optimizing synthetic metabolic pathways.",PMC5820651

To gain insight into the molecular mechanism underlying this complex phenotype, we generated transgenic lines expressing the mutant and wild-type phyB in phyB-9 background. Analysis of these transgenic lines demonstrated that the mutant photoreceptor displays a reduced rate of dark-reversion but normal P(fr) to P(r) photoconversion in vivo and shows an altered pattern of association/dissociation with nuclear bodies compared to wild-type phyB. In addition we show (i) an enhanced responsiveness to far-red light for hypocotyl growth inhibition and CAB2 expression and (ii) that far-red light mediated photoreversibility of red light induced responses, including inhibition of hypocotyl growth, formation of nuclear bodies and induction of CAB2 expression is reduced in these transgenic lines. We hypothesize that the incomplete photoreversibility of signalling is due to the fact that far-red light induced photoconversion of the chromophore is at least partially uncoupled from the P(fr) to P(r) conformation change of the protein. It follows that the phyB-401 photoreceptor retains a P(fr)-like structure (P(r) (*)) for a few hours after the far-red light treatment. The greatly reduced rate of dark reversion and the formation of a biologically active P(r) (*) conformer satisfactorily explain the complex phenotype of the phyB-401 mutant and suggest that amino acid residues surrounding the position 564 G play an important role in fine-tuning phyB signalling.",PMC3207837

We investigated the interaction between phytochromes and cry1 in the control of hypocotyl growth and cotyledon unfolding. Under conditions deficient for cry1 (short exposures to blue light) or phyB (far-red background), these photoreceptors acted synergistically: Under short exposures to blue light (3 h/d) added to a red-light background, cry1 activity required phyB (e.g. the hy4 mutant was taller than the wild type but the phyBhy4 mutant was not taller than the phyB mutant). Under prolonged exposures to blue light (24 h/d) added to a far-red light background, phyB activity required cry1 (e.g. the phyAphyB mutant was taller than the phyA mutant but the phyAphyBhy4 mutant was not taller than the phyAhy4 mutant). Under more favorable light inputs, i.e. prolonged exposures to blue light added to a red-light background, the effects of cry1 and phyB were independent. Thus, the synergism between phyB and cry1 is conditional. The effect of cry1 was not reduced by the phyA mutation under any tested light condition. Under continuous blue light the triple mutant phyAphyBhy4 showed reduced hypocotyl growth inhibition and cotyledon unfolding compared with the phyAphyB mutant. The action of cry1 in the phyAphyB double mutant was higher under the red-light than the far-red-light background, indicating a synergistic interaction between cry1 and phytochromes C, D, or E; however, a residual action of cry1 independent of any phytochrome is likely to occur.",PMC34855

Similar to PIF3, upon light exposure, PIF7 rapidly migrates to intranuclear speckles, where it colocalizes with phyB. However, in striking contrast to PIF3, this process is not accompanied by detectable light-induced phosphorylation or degradation of PIF7, suggesting that the consequences of interaction with photoactivated phyB may differ among PIFs. Nevertheless, PIF7 acts similarly to PIF3 in prolonged red light as a weak negative regulator of phyB-mediated seedling deetiolation. Examination of pif3, pif4, and pif7 double mutant combinations shows that their moderate hypersensitivity to extended red light is additive. We provide evidence that the mechanism by which these PIFs operate on the phyB signaling pathway under prolonged red light is through maintaining low phyB protein levels, in an additive or synergistic manner, via a process likely involving the proteasome pathway. These data suggest that the role of these phyB-interacting bHLH factors in modulating seedling deetiolation in prolonged red light may not be as phy-activated signaling intermediates, as proposed previously, but as direct modulators of the abundance of the photoreceptor.",PMC2276449

The recessive srr1 null allele and phyB mutants display a number of similar phenotypes indicating that SRR1 is required for normal phyB signaling. Genetic analysis suggests that SRR1 works both in the phyB pathway but also independently of phyB. srr1 mutants are affected in multiple outputs of the circadian clock in continuous light conditions, including leaf movement and expression of the clock components, CCA1 and TOC1. Clock-regulated gene expression is also impaired during day-night cycles and in constant darkness. The circadian phenotypes of srr1 mutants in all three conditions suggest that SRR1 activity is required for normal oscillator function.

Analysis of mutants specifically lacking either phyA or phyB protein demonstrated that these phytochromes are required for the negative regulation induced by far-red and red light, respectively. Ribonuclease protection experiments showed further that this negative regulation is confined almost exclusively to the shortest, most abundant PHYA transcript, and occurs predominantly in shoots.

Upon light irradiation, phytochromes are converted to the biologically active Pfr form, and translocate into the nucleus. phyB can enter the nucleus by itself in response to R light, whereas phyA nuclear import depends on two small plant-specific proteins FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 1 (FHY1) and FHY1-LIKE (FHL). Phytochromes may function as light-regulated serine/threonine kinases, and can phosphorylate several substrates, including themselves in vitro. Phytochromes are phosphoproteins, and can be dephosphorylated by a few protein phosphatases. Photoactivated phytochromes rapidly change the expression of light-responsive genes by repressing the activity of CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting several photomorphogenesis-promoting transcription factors for degradation, and by inducing rapid phosphorylation and degradation of Phytochrome-Interacting Factors (PIFs), a group of bHLH transcription factors repressing photomorphogenesis. Phytochromes are targeted by COP1 for degradation via the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway.",PMC3268501
