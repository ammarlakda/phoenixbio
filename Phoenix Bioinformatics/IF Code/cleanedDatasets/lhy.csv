0,The New phytologist ,33095906; ,"The circadian clock plays essential roles in diverse plant biological processes, such as flowering, phytohormone biosynthesis and abiotic stress responses. The manner in which circadian clock genes regulate drought stress responses in model plants has been well established, but comparatively little is known in crop species, such as soybean, a major global crop. This paper reports that the core clock components GmLHYs, the orthologues of CCA1/LHY in Arabidopsis, negatively control drought tolerance in soybean. The expressions of four GmLHYs were all induced by drought, and the quadruple mutants of GmLHYs demonstrated significantly improved drought tolerance. Transcriptome profiling suggested that the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway is regulated by GmLHYs to respond to drought tolerance. Genetic dissections showed that two homologous pairs of LHY1a and LHY1b redundantly control the drought response. Functional characterization of LHY1a and LHY1b in Arabidopsis and soybean further supported the notion that GmLHYs can maintain cellular homeostasis through the ABA signaling pathway under drought stress. This study improves our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms on soybean drought tolerance. Furthermore, the two homologues of LHY1a and LHY1b provide alternative targets for genome editing to rapidly generate mutant alleles in elite soybean cultivars to enhance their drought tolerance."
1,Journal of hematology & oncology ,34991659; ,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are major components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) which are closely associated with the tumor malignant progression. However, the regulatory mechanisms by which TAMs influence the progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain unclear. Here, we report that hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) acts as a novel oncoprotein in TNBC. We found that HLF was regulated by transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) that is secreted by TAMs. Then, HLF transactivated gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1) to promote the ferroptosis resistance, thus driving TNBC cell proliferation, metastasis and cisplatin resistance. Reciprocally, IL-6 produced by TNBC cells activated the JAK2/STAT3 axis to induce TGF-β1 secretion by TAMs, thus constituted a feed-forward circuit. The accuracy of TNBC patient prognosis could be improved by employing a combination of HLF and GGT1 values. Thus, our findings document that the interactive dialogue between TNBC cells and TAMs promotes sustained activation of HLF in tumor cells through the IL-6-TGF-β1 axis. Subsequently, HLF promotes the ferroptosis resistance in TNBC cells via GGT1 and ultimately facilitates the malignant tumor progression. Our study provides a potential target for the treatment of TNBC."

3,Plant communications ,35529947; ,"WRKY transcription factors are known mostly for their function in plant defense, abiotic stress responses, senescence, seed germination, and development of the pollen, embryo, and seed. Here, we report the regulatory functions of two WRKY proteins in photomorphogenesis and PIF4 expression. PIF4 is a critical signaling hub in light, temperature, and hormonal signaling pathways. Either its expression or its accumulation peaks in the morning and afternoon. WRKY2 and WRKY10 form heterodimers and recognize their target site in the PIF4 promoter near the MYB element that is bound by CCA1 and LHY under red and blue light. WRKY2 and WRKY10 interact directly with CCA1/LHY to enhance their targeting but interact indirectly with SHB1. The two WRKY proteins also interact with phyB, and their interaction enhances the targeting of CCA1 and LHY to the PIF4 promoter. SHB1 associates with the WRKY2 and WRKY10 loci and enhances their expression in parallel with the PIF4 expression peaks. This forward regulatory loop further sustains the accumulation of the two WRKY proteins and the targeting of CCA1/LHY to the PIF4 locus. In summary, interactions of two WRKY proteins with CCA1/LHY and phyB maintain an optimal expression level of PIF4 toward noon and afternoon, which is essential to sketch the circadian pattern of PIF4 expression."

5,BMC plant biology ,34763664; ,"SEPALLATA3 (SEP3), which is conserved across various plant species, plays essential and various roles in flower and fruit development. However, the regulatory network of the role of SEP3 in flowering time at the molecular level remained unclear."
6,Plant physiology ,35567528; ,"Many plants, including Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), accumulate starch in the daytime and remobilize it to support maintenance and growth at night. Starch accumulation is increased when carbon is in short supply, for example, in short photoperiods. Mobilization is paced to exhaust starch around dawn, as anticipated by the circadian clock. This diel pattern of turnover is largely robust against loss of day, dawn, dusk, or evening clock components. Here, we investigated diel starch turnover in the triple circadian clock mutant lhy cca1 elf3, which lacks the LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL and the CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) dawn components and the EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3) evening components of the circadian clock. The diel oscillations of transcripts for the remaining clock components and related genes like REVEILLE and PHYTOCHROME-INTERACING FACTOR family members exhibited attenuated amplitudes and altered peak time, weakened dawn dominance, and decreased robustness against changes in the external light-dark cycle. The triple mutant was unable to increase starch accumulation in short photoperiods. However, it was still able to pace starch mobilization to around dawn in different photoperiods and growth irradiances and to around 24 h after the previous dawn in T17 and T28 cycles. The triple mutant was able to slow down starch mobilization after a sudden low-light day or a sudden early dusk, although in the latter case it did not fully compensate for the lengthened night. Overall, there was a slight trend to less linear mobilization of starch. Thus, starch mobilization can be paced rather robustly to dawn despite a major disruption of the transcriptional clock. It is proposed that temporal information can be delivered from clock components or a semi-autonomous oscillator."
7,The Plant cell ,34931682; ,"Vernalization, a long-term cold-mediated acquisition of flowering competence, is critically regulated by VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3), a gene induced by vernalization in Arabidopsis. Although the function of VIN3 has been extensively studied, how VIN3 expression itself is upregulated by long-term cold is not well understood. In this study, we identified a vernalization-responsive cis-element in the VIN3 promoter, VREVIN3, composed of a G-box and an evening element (EE). Mutations in either the G-box or the EE prevented VIN3 expression from being fully induced upon vernalization, leading to defects in the vernalization response. We determined that the core clock proteins CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and LATE-ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) associate with the EE of VREVIN3, both in vitro and in vivo. In a cca1 lhy double mutant background harboring a functional FRIGIDA allele, long-term cold-mediated VIN3 induction and acceleration of flowering were impaired, especially under mild cold conditions such as at 12°C. During prolonged cold exposure, oscillations of CCA1/LHY transcripts were altered, while CCA1 abundance increased at dusk, coinciding with the diurnal peak of VIN3 transcripts. We propose that modulation of the clock proteins CCA1 and LHY participates in the systems involved in sensing long-term cold for the activation of VIN3 transcription."
8,Developmental cell ,12015970; ,"Several genes are known to regulate circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis, but the identity of the central oscillator has not been established. LHY and CCA1 are related MYB-like transcription factors proposed to be closely involved. Here we demonstrate that, as shown previously for CCA1, inactivation of LHY shortens the period of circadian rhythms in gene expression and leaf movements. By constructing lhy cca1-1 double mutants, we show that LHY and CCA1 are partially redundant and essential for the maintenance of circadian rhythms in constant light. Under light/dark cycles the lhy cca1-1 plants show dramatically earlier phases of expression of GI and TOC1, genes associated with the generation of circadian rhythms and the promotion of LHY and CCA1 expression. We conclude that LHY and CCA1 appear to be negative regulatory elements required for central oscillator function."

10,iScience ,32947126; ,"Brassinosteroids (BRs) regulate a variety of physiological processes in plants via extensive crosstalk with diverse biological signaling networks. Although BRs are known to reciprocally regulate circadian oscillation, the molecular mechanism underlying BR-mediated regulation of circadian clock remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the BR-activated transcription factor bri1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1) integrates BR signaling into the circadian network in Arabidopsis. BES1 repressed expression of CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) at night by binding to their promoters, together with TOPLESS (TPL). The repression of CCA1 and LHY by BR treatment, which occurred during the night, was compromised in bes1-ko and tpl-8 mutants. Consistently, long-term treatment with BR shortened the circadian period, and BR-induced rhythmic shortening was impaired in bes1-ko and tpl-8 single mutants and in the cca1-1lhy-21 double mutant. Overall, BR signaling is conveyed to the circadian oscillator via the BES1/TPL-CCA1/LHY module, contributing to gating diurnal BR responses in plants."

12,Nature genetics ,32231277; ,"Adaptive changes in plant phenology are often considered to be a feature of the so-called 'domestication syndrome' that distinguishes modern crops from their wild progenitors, but little detailed evidence supports this idea. In soybean, a major legume crop, flowering time variation is well characterized within domesticated germplasm and is critical for modern production, but its importance during domestication is unclear. Here, we identify sequential contributions of two homeologous pseudo-response-regulator genes, Tof12 and Tof11, to ancient flowering time adaptation, and demonstrate that they act via LHY homologs to promote expression of the legume-specific E1 gene and delay flowering under long photoperiods. We show that Tof12-dependent acceleration of maturity accompanied a reduction in dormancy and seed dispersal during soybean domestication, possibly predisposing the incipient crop to latitudinal expansion. Better understanding of this early phase of crop evolution will help to identify functional variation lost during domestication and exploit its potential for future crop improvement."
13,Plant molecular biology ,15988568; ,"Multiple photoreceptors contribute to the entrainment of the Arabidopsis circadian clock to daily cycles of light and darkness but little is known of the mechanisms by which these pathways affect the central oscillator. Here we investigate the epistatic interaction between DE-ETIOLATED 1 (DET1), a negative regulator of light-regulated gene expression, and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY), one of the core components of the circadian oscillator. The daily onset of LHY gene expression was advanced by approximately 4 h in det1-1 mutant plants, suggesting that the wild-type DET1 protein might function to repress its transcription during the subjective night. lhy-1 det1-1 double mutants exhibited arrhythmic expression of the CAB gene in constant light, similar to the lhy-1 mutant parent. However, additive effects of the lhy-1 and det1-1 mutations on CAB2 expression patterns were revealed under diurnal light-dark cycles. Since the lhy-1 mutation causes aberrant, constitutive transcription of LHY from a constitutive viral promoter, this observation indicated that effects of DET1 were not mediated through the regulation of LHY transcription. Furthermore, the light-driven, rhythmic accumulation of the LHY protein in the lhy-1 mutant was altered by the det1-1 mutation, suggesting that DET1 might regulate LHY expression at the post-transcriptional level. In vitro protein degradation assays demonstrated that the LHY protein is turned over rapidly through the proteasome pathway. Similar degradation was observed whether plant tissue was harvested during the light or dark portion of the diurnal cycle, but the process was significantly accelerated in det1-1 mutant extracts. These results indicate that the wild-type DET1 protein acts to inhibit the proteolytic turnover of the LHY protein, and suggest a mechanism for the period-shortening effect of the det1-1 mutation. These findings add to recent evidence suggesting a role for DET1 in a ubiquitination pathway and identify a substrate for DET1-regulated protein turn-over."
14,In vitro cellular & developmental biology. Animal ,22806968; ,"Endometrial cancer is a major problem for women but only a small number of comprehensively characterized cell models are available for studies. Here, we established a new cell line derived from a Stage IIIc(1) Grade 2 endometrial adenocarcinoma. The cell line, designated LHY-821, was characterized using growth curve, karyotyping, immunohistochemical staining, immunoblotting, drug sensitivity assay, invasion assay, and xenografting in nude mice. LHY-821 has a doubling time of about 46 h and a colony-forming efficiency of approximately 71 %. These cells expresse high levels of progesterone receptor but not estrogen receptor and are sensitive to medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). LHY-821 also expresses pan-cytokeratin, PTEN, p53, β-catenin, IGF-1, and IGF-2. In addition, karyotype analysis revealed that LHY-821 possessed a near diploid karyotype including 6q-, 10p-, Xq-, 13q+, 17p+, and Triplo-12. LHY-821 showed highly tumorigenicity in nude mice (100 %) and weak invasiveness. Chemosensitivity tests showed that LHY-821 was sensitive to both carboplatin and paclitaxel. LHY-821 is an immortalized cell line which had survived more than 80 serial passages; it may provide a novel tool to study the molecular mechanism and potential treatment for endometrial cancer."
15,"Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry ",31478783; ,"The circadian clock enables plants to adapt to their environment and control numerous physiological processes, including plant-pathogen interactions. However, it is unknown if the circadian clock controls nonhost resistance (NHR) in plants. To find out, we analyzed microarray data with the web-based tool DIURNAL to reveal that NHR-related genes show rhythmic expression patterns in the absence of a pathogen challenge. Our clock mutant analyses found that cca1-1 lhy-11 double mutant showed compromised NHR to Pyricularia oryzae, suggesting that two components of the circadian clock, CCA1 and LHY, are involved in regulating penetration resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. By analyzing pen2 double mutants, we revealed that CCA1 contributes to time-of-day-dependent penetration resistance as a positive regulator and that LHY regulates post-penetration resistance as a positive regulator. Taken together, our results suggest that the circadian clock regulates the time-of-day-dependent NHR to P. oryzae and thus enables A. thaliana to counteract pathogen attacks.Abbreviations: EE: evening element; ETI: effector-triggered immunity; NHR: nonhost resistance; PAMP: pathogen-associated molecular pattern; PTI: PAMP-triggered immunity; SAR: systemic acquired resistance."

17,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB ,35065375; ,"Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step during gene expression, which takes place in the spliceosome, a large dynamic ribonucleoprotein complex assembled in a stepwise manner. During the last decade, several spliceosomal mutants were functionally identified to cause a lengthened circadian period by introducing intron retention defects into circadian clock genes in Arabidopsis. However, the spliceosomal components that play opposite roles in the circadian period via alternative 3' splice site (Alt 3'ss) are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that XCT (XAP5 CIRCADIAN TIMEKEEPER) is a key spliceosomal component associated with multiple splicing factors. Moreover, genome-wide analysis revealed that inactivation of XCT particularly results in defects in Alt 3'ss recognition by RNA sequencing. Further analysis indicated that a strong alteration in the 3' splice sites of LHY and TIC partly accounts for the shortened circadian period of the xct mutant. Therefore, our results demonstrated that mutations in XCT shortened the circadian period partly by alternative splicing of LHY and TIC particularly in 3' splice site recognition, which provides new insight into the link between alternative splicing and the circadian clock."
18,Frontiers in plant science ,32973836; ,"Stylosanthes species are economically important tropical and subtropical forage legumes which are generally vulnerable to chilling and frost. Fine-stem stylo (S. guianensis var. intermedia) has the most superior cold tolerance among all stylo species. A REVEILLE (RVE) gene, SgRVE6, was cloned from fine-stem stylo. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that SgRVE6 encodes a transcription factor of 292 amino acid residues, which belongs to the LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL/CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1-LIKE (LCL) subgroup of RVE family and contains a SHAQKYF-class MYB domain and a LCL domain. SgRVE6 is universally expressed in root, stem and leaf tissues of fine-stem stylo and is rapidly up-regulated in all tested tissues under cold stress. Over-expressing SgRVE6 affects expression of 21 circadian clock genes, up-regulates expression of 6 nucleotide binding domain leucine-rich repeats (NB-LRR) encoding genes associated with tobacco cold tolerance, improves physiological responses to low temperature, and endows the transgenic tobaccos with higher tolerance to cold stress. This is the first time a study investigates the biological function of RVE6 in cold responses of plant species."

20,The New phytologist ,30191576; ,"The LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) transcription factor functions as part of the oscillatory mechanism of the Arabidopsis circadian clock. This paper reports the genome-wide analysis of its binding targets and reveals a role in the control of abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and downstream responses. LHY directly repressed expression of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase enzymes, which catalyse the rate-limiting step of ABA biosynthesis. This suggested a mechanism for the circadian control of ABA accumulation in wild-type plants. Consistent with this hypothesis, ABA accumulated rhythmically in wild-type plants, peaking in the evening. LHY-overexpressing plants had reduced levels of ABA under drought stress, whereas loss-of-function mutants exhibited an altered rhythm of ABA accumulation. LHY also bound the promoter of multiple components of ABA signalling pathways, suggesting that it may also act to regulate responses downstream of the hormone. LHY promoted expression of ABA-responsive genes responsible for increased tolerance to drought and osmotic stress but alleviated the inhibitory effect of ABA on seed germination and plant growth. This study reveals a complex interaction between the circadian clock and ABA pathways, which is likely to make an important contribution to plant performance under drought and osmotic stress conditions."
21,The EMBO journal ,12574129; ,"The transcription factor LHY and the related protein CCA1 perform overlapping functions in a regulatory feedback loop that is closely associated with the circadian oscillator of Arabidopsis: Overexpression of LHY abolished function of the circadian clock in constant light, but rhythmic expression of several circadian clock-regulated transcripts was observed under light- dark cycles. These oscillations correlated with high amplitude changes in LHY protein levels, caused by light-induced translation of the LHY transcript. Increases in LHY protein levels were also observed in light-grown wild-type plants, when light signals coincided with the circadian-regulated peak of LHY transcription at dawn. Unexpectedly, translational induction coincided with acute downregulation of LHY transcript levels. We suggest that the simultaneous translational induction and transcriptional repression of LHY expression play a role to narrow the peak of LHY protein synthesis at dawn and increase the robustness and accuracy of circadian oscillations. Strong phase shifting responses to light signals were observed in plants lacking function of LHY, CCA1 or both, suggesting that light-regulated expression of these proteins does not mediate entrainment of the clock to light-dark cycles."
22,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology ,16212608; ,"Evidence has been presented that a negative transcriptional feedback loop formed by the genes CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED (CCA1), LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and TIMING OF CAB (TOC1) constitutes the core of the central oscillator of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis. Here we show that these genes are expressed at constant, basal levels in dark-grown seedlings. Transfer to constant red light (Rc) rapidly induces a biphasic pattern of CCA1 and LHY expression, and a reciprocal TOC1 expression pattern over the first 24 h, consistent with initial induction of this synchronous oscillation by the light signal. We have used this assay with wild-type and mutant seedlings to examine the role of these oscillator components, and to determine the function of ELF3 and ELF4 in their light-regulated expression. The data show that whereas TOC1 is necessary for light-induced CCA1/LHY expression, the combined absence of CCA1 and LHY has little effect on the pattern of light-induced TOC1 expression, indicating that the negative regulatory arm of the proposed oscillator is not fully functional during initial seedling de-etiolation. By contrast, ELF4 is necessary for light-induced expression of both CCA1 and LHY, and conversely, CCA1 and LHY act negatively on light-induced ELF4 expression. Together with the observation that the temporal light-induced expression profile of ELF4 is counter-phased to that of CCA1 and LHY and parallels that of TOC1, these data are consistent with a previously unrecognized negative-feedback loop formed by CCA1/LHY and ELF4 in a manner analogous to the proposed CCA1/LHY/TOC1 oscillator. ELF3 is also necessary for light-induced CCA1/LHY expression, but it is neither light-induced nor clock-regulated during de-etiolation. Taken together, the data suggest (a) that ELF3, ELF4, and TOC1 all function in the primary, phytochrome-mediated light-input pathway to the circadian oscillator in Arabidopsis; and (b) that this oscillator consists of two or more interlocking transcriptional feedback loops that may be differentially operative during initial light induction and under steady-state circadian conditions in entrained green plants."
23,"Plant biotechnology (Tokyo, Japan) ",31274993; ,"The circadian clock plays important roles in the control of photoperiodic flowering in Arabidopsis. Mutations in the LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) genes (lhy;cca1) accelerate flowering under short days, whereas lhy;cca1 delays flowering under continuous light (LL). The lhy;cca1 mutant also exhibits short hypocotyls and petioles under LL. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of both flowering time and organ lengths in the LHY/CCA1-dependent pathway are not fully understood. To address these questions, we performed EMS mutagenesis of the lhy-12;cca1-101 line and screened for mutations that enhance the lhy;cca1 phenotypes under LL. In this screen, we identified a novel allele of dwarf4 (dwf4) and named it petanko 5 (pta5). A similar level of enhancement of the delay in flowering was observed in these two dwf4 mutants when combined with the lhy;cca1 mutations. The lhy;cca1 and dwf4 mutations did not significantly affect the expression level of the floral repressor gene FLC under LL. Our results suggest that a defect in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling delayed flowering independent of the FLC expression level, at least in plants with the lhy;cca1 mutation grown under LL. The dwf4/pta5 mutation did not enhance the late-flowering phenotype of plants overexpressing SVP under LL, suggesting that SVP and BR function in a common pathway that controls flowering time. Our results suggest that the lhy;cca1 mutant exhibits delayed flowering due to both the BR signaling-dependent and -independent pathways under LL."
24,Journal of integrative plant biology ,28429400; ,"The circadian clock is known to increase plant growth and fitness, and is thought to prepare plants for photosynthesis at dawn and dusk; whether this happens in nature was unknown. We transformed the native tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata to silence two core clock components, NaLHY (irLHY) and NaTOC1 (irTOC1). We characterized growth and light- and dark-adapted photosynthetic rates (Ac ) throughout a 24 h day in empty vector-transformed (EV), irLHY, and irTOC1 plants in the field, and in NaPhyA- and NaPhyB1-silenced plants in the glasshouse. The growth rates of irLHY plants were lower than those of EV plants in the field. While irLHY plants reduced Ac earlier at dusk, no differences between irLHY and EV plants were observed at dawn in the field. irLHY, but not EV plants, responded to light in the night by rapidly increasing Ac . Under controlled conditions, EV plants rapidly increased Ac in the day compared to dark-adapted plants at night; irLHY plants lost these time-dependent responses. The role of NaLHY in gating photosynthesis is independent of the light-dependent reactions and red light perceived by NaPhyA, but not NaPhyB1. In summary, the circadian clock allows plants not to respond photosynthetically to light at night by anticipating and gating red light-mediated in native tobacco."
25,The New phytologist ,26439540; ,"The rhythmic opening/closing and volatile emissions of flowers are known to attract pollinators at specific times. That these rhythms are maintained under constant light or dark conditions suggests a circadian clock involvement. Although a forward and reverse genetic approach has led to the identification of core circadian clock components in Arabidopsis thaliana, the involvement of these clock components in floral rhythms has remained untested, probably because of the weak diurnal rhythms in A. thaliana flowers. Here, we addressed the role of these core clock components in the flowers of the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata, whose flowers open at night, emit benzyl acetone (BA) scents and move vertically through a 140° arc. We first measured N. attenuata floral rhythms under constant light conditions. The results suggest that the circadian clock controls flower opening, BA emission and pedicel movement, but not flower closing. We generated transgenic N. attenuata lines silenced in the homologous genes of Arabidopsis LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and ZEITLUPE (ZTL), which are known to be core clock components. Silencing NaLHY and NaZTL strongly altered floral rhythms in different ways, indicating that conserved clock components in N. attenuata coordinate these floral rhythms."
26,The Plant cell ,19011118; ,"The floral regulators GIGANTEA (GI), CONSTANS (CO), and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) play key roles in the photoperiodic flowering responses of the long-day plant Arabidopsis thaliana.

Here, we demonstrate that the circadian clock proteins LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) not only repressed the floral transition under short-day and long-day conditions but also accelerated flowering when the plants were grown under continuous light (LL). LHY and CCA1 accelerated flowering in LL by promoting FT expression through a genetic pathway that appears to be independent of the canonical photoperiodic pathway involving GI and CO proteins. A genetic screen revealed that the late-flowering phenotype of the lhy;cca1 double mutant under LL was suppressed through mutations in SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), a MADS box transcription factor. Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated an interaction between SVP and FLOWERING LOCUS C, and genetic analysis indicated that these two proteins act as partially redundant repressors of flowering time. SVP protein accumulated in lhy;cca1 plants under LL. We propose a model in which LHY and CCA1 accelerate flowering in part by reducing the abundance of SVP and thereby antagonizing its capacity to repress FT expression under LL."
27,"Plant, cell & environment ",29532482; ,"One of the ways in which plants can respond to temperature is via alternative splicing (AS). Previous work showed that temperature changes affected the splicing of several circadian clock gene transcripts. Here, we investigated the role of RNA-binding splicing factors (SFs) in temperature-sensitive AS of the clock gene LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY). We characterized, in wild type plants, temperature-associated isoform switching and expression patterns for SF transcripts from a high-resolution temperature and time series RNA-seq experiment. In addition, we employed quantitative RT-PCR of SF mutant plants to explore the role of the SFs in cooling-associated AS of LHY. We show that the splicing and expression of several SFs responds sufficiently, rapidly, and sensitively to temperature changes to contribute to the splicing of the 5'UTR of LHY. Moreover, the choice of splice site in LHY was altered in some SF mutants. The splicing of the 5'UTR region of LHY has characteristics of a molecular thermostat, where the ratio of transcript isoforms is sensitive to temperature changes as modest as 2 °C and is scalable over a wide dynamic range of temperature. Our work provides novel insight into SF-mediated coupling of the perception of temperature to post-transcriptional regulation of the clock."
28,Current biology : CB ,12007421; ,"Circadian clocks are autoregulatory, endogenous mechanisms that allow organisms, from bacteria to humans, to advantageously time a wide range of activities within 24-hr environmental cycles. CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) are thought to be important components of the circadian clock in the model plant Arabidopsis. The similar circadian phenotypes of lines overexpressing either CCA1 or LHY have suggested that the functions of these two transcription factors are largely overlapping. cca1-1 plants, which lack CCA1 protein, show a short-period phenotype for the expression of several genes when assayed under constant light conditions. This suggests that LHY function is able to only partially compensate for the lack of CCA1 protein, resulting in a clock with a faster pace in cca1-1 plants. We have obtained plants lacking CCA1 and with LHY function strongly reduced, cca1-1 lhy-R, and show that these plants are unable to maintain sustained oscillations in both constant light and constant darkness. However, these plants exhibit some circadian function in light/dark cycles, showing that the Arabidopsis circadian clock is not entirely dependent on CCA1 and LHY activities."

We also found that SINAT5 has E3 ubiquitination activity for LHY but not for DET1. Interestingly, LHY ubiquitination by SINAT5 was inhibited by DET1. Late flowering of sinat5 mutants indicates that flowering time can be controlled by DET1 through regulation of LHY stability by SINAT5."

Here, we show that, in Arabidopsis thaliana, loss of the central clock genes, CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY), results in both reduced Fe uptake and photosynthetic efficiency, whereas CCA1 overexpression confers the opposite effects. We show that root Fe(III) reduction activity, and expression of FERRIC REDUCTION OXIDASE 2 (FRO2) and IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER 1 (IRT1) exhibit circadian oscillations, which are disrupted in the cca1 lhy double mutant. Furthermore, CCA1 directly binds to the specific regulatory regions of multiple Fe homeostasis genes and activates their expression.

The flowering times of single mutants of three phyB alleles, hy3-1, del1, and phyB-2511, are almost the same and earlier than those of wild-type plants. A similar level of acceleration of flowering time was observed in all three phyB mutants tested when combined with the late-flowering mutations co-2 and SVPox. However, the effect of phyB-2511 on lhy;cca1 was different from those by hy3-1 or del1. svp-3 did not strongly enhance the early-flowering phenotypes of phyB-2511 or del1. These results suggest that light signaling via PhyB may affect factors downstream of the clock proteins, controlling flowering time and organ elongation. phyB mutations with different levels of effects on lhy;cca1-dependent late flowering would be useful to determine a specific role for PHYB in the flowering pathway controlled by lhy;cca1 under LL."

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying cobalt-induced neurotoxicity have not been elucidated in detail. In the present research, we used human neuroglioma H4 cells as an in vitro model. Cells were exposed to CoCl2 (0, 100, 200, 400 μM) for 24 h. We performed m6A sequencing techniques and constructed FTO-knockdown/FTO-overexpressing cells to investigate the role of FTO-mediated m6A modification in regulating apoptosis following CoCl2 induced oxidative stress. Our study has shown CoCl2 exposure led to the decrease of demethylase FTO as well as elevated oxidative stress. However, NAC treatment could partly reverse the reduction of FTO expression as well as the degree of ROS via eliminating oxidative stress. Meanwhile, MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq further revealed the potential function m6A modification in regulating apoptosis. More importantly, KEGG pathway and Gene ontology (GO) analyses further elucidated that the differentially m6A-modified genes were aggregated in apoptosis-related pathways. Mechanistic analysis indicated that knockdown of FTO facilitated CoCl2-induced apoptosis via caspase activation and G1/S cell cycle arrest. Nevertheless, overexpression of FTO partly attenuated the increased apoptosis following CoCl2 exposure. More notably, we observed that FTO regulated apoptosis in an m6A-dependent manner. Therefore, our findings reveal that CoCl2 induced ROS affected the m6A modification of apoptosis-related genes by decreasing the expression of FTO, thereby resulting in the activation of apoptosis. These findings provide important insights into CoCl2-induced apoptosis and m6A modification and propose a novel strategy for studying environmental toxicant-related neurodegeneration."

These genes thus drive rhythmic outputs, including seasonal control of flowering and photomorphogenesis. To test various clock models and to disclose the genetic relationship between TOC1 and CCA1/LHY in floral induction and photomorphogenesis, we constructed the cca1 lhy toc1 triple mutant and cca1 toc1 and lhy toc1 double mutants and tested various rhythmic responses and circadian output regulation. Here we report that rhythmic activity was dramatically attenuated in cca1 lhy toc1. Interestingly, we also found that TOC1 regulates the floral transition in a CCA1/LHY-dependent manner while CCA1/LHY functions upstream of TOC1 in regulating a photomorphogenic process. This suggests to us that TOC1 and CCA1/LHY participate in these two processes through different strategies. Collectively, we have used genetics to provide direct experimental support of previous modeling efforts where CCA1/LHY, along with TOC1, drives the circadian oscillator and have shown that this clock is essential for correct output regulation."

The plant growth and fitness are enhanced by circadian clocks through coordination of numerous biological events. In legume species, nitrogen-fixing root nodules were developed as the plant organs specialized for symbiotic transfer of nitrogen between microsymbiont and host. Here, we report that the endogenous circadian rhythm in nodules is regulated by MtLHY in legume species Medicago truncatula. Loss of function of MtLHY leads to a reduction in the number of nodules formed, resulting in a diminished ability to assimilate nitrogen. The operation of the 24-h rhythm in shoot is further influenced by the availability of nitrogen produced by the nodules, leading to the irregulated nyctinastic leaf movement and reduced biomass in mtlhy mutants. These data shed new light on the roles of MtLHY in the orchestration of circadian oscillator in nodules and shoots, which provides a mechanistic link between nodulation, nitrogen assimilation, and clock function."

Experimentally such a LHY fluid is realized by controlling the atom numbers and interaction strengths in a ^{39}K spin mixture confined in a spherical trap potential. We measure the monopole oscillation frequency as a function of the LHY interaction strength as proposed recently by Jrgensen et al. [Phys. Rev.

This confirms that the system and its collective behavior are initially dominated by LHY interactions. Moreover, the monopole oscillation frequency is found to be stable against variations of the involved scattering lengths in a broad region around the ideal values, confirming the stabilizing effect of the LHY interaction. These results pave the way for using the nonlinearity provided by the LHY term in quantum simulation experiments and for investigations beyond the LHY regime."

However, the role of MUC15 in the regulation of liver tumor-initiating cells (T-ICs) remains unknown. Here, we report that expression of MUC15 is downregulated in liver T-ICs, chemoresistance and recurrent HCC samples. Functional studies reveal that MUC15 inhibits hepatoma cells self-renewal, malignant proliferation, tumorigenicity, and chemoresistance. Mechanistically, MUC15 interacts with c-MET and subsequently inactivates the PI3K/AKT/SOX2 signaling pathway. Moreover, we find that miR-183-5p.1 directly targets MUC15 3'-UTR in liver T-ICs. Coincidentally, SOX2 feedback inhibits MUC15 expression by directly transactivating miR-183-5p.1, thus completing a feedforward regulatory circuit in liver T-ICs. Importantly, MUC15/c-MET/PI3K/AKT/SOX2 axis determines the responses of hepatoma cells to lenvatinib treatment, and MUC15 overexpression abrogated lenvatinib resistance. Analysis of patient cohort, patient-derived tumor organoids and patient-derived xenografts further suggests that the MUC15 may predict lenvatinib benefits in HCC patients. Collectively, our findings suggest the crucial role of the miR-183-5p.1/MUC15/c-MET/PI3K/AKT/SOX2 regulatory circuit in regulating liver T-ICs properties, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for HCC."

There is a negative feedback loop between the morning expressed CCA1 (CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1)/LHY (LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL) and evening expressed TOC1 (TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1). CCA1 and LHY negatively regulate the expression of TOC1, while TOC1 also binds to the promoters of CCA1 and LHY to repress their expression. Recent studies indicate that histone modifications play an important role in the regulation of the central oscillators. However, the regulatory relationship between histone modifications and the circadian clock genes remains largely unclear. In this study, we found that the Lysine-Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1)-like histone demethylases, LDL1 and LDL2, can interact with CCA1/LHY to repress the expression of TOC1. ChIP-Seq analysis indicated that LDL1 targets a subset of genes involved in the circadian rhythm regulated by CCA1. Furthermore, LDL1 and LDL2 interact with the histone deacetylase HDA6 and co-regulate TOC1 by histone demetylation and deacetylaion. These results provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of how the circadian clock central oscillator genes are regulated through histone modifications."

Under different light regimes, Lhcb and PvLHY exhibit a clear circadian pattern of expression. Moreover, the rhythm of Lhcb genes appears to be tightly coupled to that of PvLHY with the latter having a slightly earlier phase. This supports the idea that the oscillating capacity of PvLHY may be one of the causes of the rhythmic expression of Lhcb genes in bean. In addition to their circadian regulation, Lhcb and PvLHY are induced by light with similar and relatively slow induction kinetics. Moreover, this light induction is gated by the circadian oscillator: minimal responses occur at times around peaks of the pre-existing rhythm, while maximal ones occur at troughs of the pre-existing rhythm. This pattern of gating is opposite to that observed in Arabidopsis. The failure to block the light induction pathways at pre-existing troughs appears to have a detrimental effect to the subsequent circadian rhythmicity. Briefly, the overall regulation of PvLHY and Lhcb genes by light and the circadian clock reveals different strategies between Phaseolus and Arabidopsis in the adaptation to photoperiodic conditions."
43,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology ,19624471; ,"The evolution of circadian clocks in land plants is not understood, because circadian rhythms have received little attention in plants other than angiosperms. We have characterized two genes, PpCCA1a and PpCCA1b, homologs of the Arabidopsis thaliana clock genes CCA1/LHY, from the moss Physcomitrella patens. PpCCA1a and PpCCA1b, together with angiosperm CCA1/LHY homologs, belong to the clock-associated single-myb gene family of green plants (including green algae and land plants). The accumulation of PpCCA1a and PpCCA1b mRNA showed rhythms with a period of approximately 1 day, phased as are those of angiosperm homologs, under 24 h light/dark cycles or in continuous dark. However, in marked contrast to angiosperm homologs, both genes showed arrhythmic profiles in continuous light. The timing of the PpCCA1b peak is determined by the time of the last light to dark transition, suggesting that the arrhythmicity in continuous light is due to dysfunction of the core clock. We generated single and double disruptants for PpCCA1a and PpCCA1b, and found that the double disruptants showed: (i) short periodicity and damped amplitude in the PpCCA1b rhythm, (ii) similar changes in the rhythmically expressed genes PpSIG5 and PpPRRa, and (iii) de-repression of PpCCA1b transcription levels, indicating negative feedback regulation. These observations indicate that the two genes are not merely structural homologs but also functional counterparts of CCA1/LHY. Together, our results illustrate similarities as well as divergence of the clock machineries between P. patens and A. thaliana, two distantly placed species in land plant phylogeny."

It is important in many cellular and developmental processes in both plants and animals, but its molecular mode of action remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the CDD component DET1 possesses transcriptional repression activity and physically interacts with two closely related MYB transcription factors, CCA1 and LHY, which are core components of the plant circadian clock. DET1 associates with the promoter of CCA1/LHY target genes, such as TOC1, in a CCA1/LHY-dependent manner and is required for their repression, suggesting a recruitment of DET1 by the central oscillator components to regulate the clock. Our results reveal DET1 as a core transcriptional repression factor important for clock progression. Overall, the CDD complex may function as a transcriptional corepressor in diverse processes through direct interaction with distinct transcription factors."

A precise regulation of transcriptional events is, therefore, essential for proper circadian function. Here, we investigated histone 3 (H3) tail modifications of CCA1, LHY and TOC1 under various conditions. We found specific association of only H3K4Me3 and H3K9/14Ac with the translational start site of these three genes. These H3 marks were enriched at circadian time points of their increased transcription at different photoperiods and under free-running conditions, suggesting circadian regulation of H3 modifications.

The transgenic plants transformed with the promoter including the 5'UTR had altered circadian regulation resulting in elongated hypocotyls, a bushy appearance and delayed flowering. In contrast, the transgenic plants transformed with the promoter without the 5'UTR showed earlier flowering than the wild type. Changes in CCA1, LHY and TOC1 gene expression were investigated under light-dark (L:D) fluctuations, continuous darkness (D:D) and continuous light (L:L). The circadian expression of CCA1 was altered in both sets of transgenic plants, being repressed in the plants transformed with the 1.01-kb fragment and constitutively overexpressed in those transformed with the 1.3-kb fragment. Under L:D conditions, regulation of LHY and TOC1 expression was separated from CCA1 regulation in both sets of transgenic plants, with intact rhythmic expression of both LHY and TOC1. Under D:D conditions, the rhythmic expression of LHY and TOC1 was lost in the 1.3 plants but retained with some erratic pattern under L:L conditions. In the 1.01 plants, under both D:D and L:L conditions the rhythmic expression was retained. These results indicate separate light-induced signal-transmission pathways for LHY and CCA1."

Nevertheless, the genetic linkages between the major clock-associated TOC1, CCA1 and LHY genes and the canonical CO-FT flowering pathway are less clear. By employing a set of mutants including an extremely early flowering toc1 cca1 lhy triple mutant, here we showed that CCA1 and LHY act redundantly as negative regulators of the photoperiodic flowering pathway. The partly redundant CCA1/LHY functions are largely, but not absolutely, dependent on the upstream TOC1 gene that serves as an activator. The results of examination with reference to the expression profiles of CO and FT in the mutants indicated that this clock circuitry is indeed linked to the CO-FT output pathway, if not exclusively. For this linkage, the phase control of certain flowering-associated genes, GI, CDF1 and FKF1, appears to be crucial. Furthermore, the genetic linkage between TOC1 and CCA1/LHY is compatible with the negative and positive feedback loop, which is currently believed to be a core of the circadian clock. The results of this study suggested that the circadian clock might open an exit for a photoperiodic output pathway during the daytime. In the context of the current clock model, these results will be discussed in connection with the previous finding that the same clock might open an exit for the early photomorphogenic output pathway during the night-time."
49,Frontiers in plant science ,27148293; ,"To successfully recruit pollinators, plants often release attractive floral scents at specific times of day to coincide with pollinator foraging. This timing of scent emission is thought to be evolutionarily beneficial to maximize resource efficiency while attracting only useful pollinators. Temporal regulation of scent emission is tied to the activity of the specific metabolic pathways responsible for scent production. Although floral volatile profiling in various plants indicated a contribution by the circadian clock, the mechanisms by which the circadian clock regulates timing of floral scent emission remained elusive. Recent studies using two species in the Solanaceae family provided initial insight into molecular clock regulation of scent emission timing. In Petunia hybrida, the floral volatile benzenoid/phenylpropanoid (FVBP) pathway is the major metabolic pathway that produces floral volatiles. Three MYB-type transcription factors, ODORANT 1 (ODO1), EMISSION OF BENZENOIDS I (EOBI), and EOBII, all of which show diurnal rhythms in mRNA expression, act as positive regulators for several enzyme genes in the FVBP pathway. Recently, in P. hybrida and Nicotiana attenuata, homologs of the Arabidopsis clock gene LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) have been shown to have a similar role in the circadian clock in these plants, and to also determine the timing of scent emission. In addition, in P. hybrida, PhLHY directly represses ODO1 and several enzyme genes in the FVBP pathway during the morning as an important negative regulator of scent emission. These findings facilitate our understanding of the relationship between a molecular timekeeper and the timing of scent emission, which may influence reproductive success."
50,The Plant cell ,21098730; ,"A defining, yet poorly understood characteristic of the circadian clock is that it is buffered against changes in temperature such that the period length is relatively constant across a range of physiologically relevant temperatures. We describe here the role of PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR7 (PRR7) and PRR9 in temperature compensation. The Arabidopsis thaliana circadian oscillator comprises a series of interlocking feedback loops, and PRR7 and PRR9 function in the morning loop. The prr7 prr9 double mutant displays a unique phenotype that has not been observed before in other Arabidopsis clock mutants. In the prr7 prr9 mutant, the effects of temperature are overcompensated, apparently due to hyperactivation of the transcription factors CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY). Inactivation of CCA1 and LHY fully suppresses the overcompensation defects of prr7 prr9 mutants and rescues their long period phenotype. Overcompensation in prr7 prr9 mutants does not rely on FLOWERING LOCUS C, a previously identified gene required for temperature compensation. Together, our results reveal a role of PRR7 and PRR9 in regulating CCA1 and LHY activities in response to ambient temperature."

In addition, 22 genes were found to co-localize with QTLs for six traits including flowering time, first flower, pod maturity, beginning of pod, reproductive period, and seed filling period. Among the genes overlapping the QTL regions, two LHY/CCA1 genes, GI and SFR6 contained amino acid changes. The recently duplicated sequence regions of the soybean genome were used as additional criteria for the speculation of the putative function of the homologs. Two duplicated regions showed redundancy of both flowering-related genes and QTLs.

Our recent study has demonstrated that CCA1 promotes plant resistance to the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) through modulation of indole glucosinolate biosynthesis, but the role of LHY remains to be elucidated. Here we showed that, similar to cca1-11, single mutant lhy-21 became more susceptible to aphid infestation. Damage to the cca1-11 lhy-21 double mutant by aphids was most pronounced, indicating that the defensive roles of CCA1 and LHY were not entirely redundant. Also, the cyclic expression pattern of key indole glucosinolate biosynthetic genes was considerably disturbed in both single mutants and this was more severe in the double mutant. Apparently, both CCA1 and LHY were necessary for circadian-regulated indole glucosinolate biosynthesis. Taken together, LHY-CCA1 coordination in transcriptional regulation of indole glucosinolate biosynthetic genes most likely contributed to plant defensive capacity against aphids."

In this work, in-duct disinfectors based on grating-like dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasmas with varied electrode arrangements were established and evaluated. The highest airborne bacterial inactivation efficiency was achieved by 'vertical' structure, namely when aerosol was in direct contact with the discharge region, at a given discharge power. For all reactors, the efficiency was linearly correlated to the discharge power (R2 =0.929-0.994). The effects of environmental factors were examined. Decreased airflow rates boosted the efficiency, which reached 99.8% at the velocity of 0.5 m/s with an aerosol residence time of ~3.6 ms. Increasing humidity (relative humidity (RH)=20-60%) contributed to inactivation efficacy, while high humidity (RH=70%-90%) led to a saturated efficiency, possibly due to the disruption of discharge uniformity. As suggested by the plasma effluent treatment and scavenger experiments, gaseous short-lived chemical species or charged particles were concluded as the major agents accounting for bacterial inactivation.

PRR9, PRR7, and PRR5 each suppress CCA1 and LHY promoter activities and confer transcriptional repressor activity to a heterologous DNA binding protein in a transient reporter assay. Using a glucocorticoid-induced PRR5-GR (glucorticoid receptor) construct, we found that PRR5 directly downregulates CCA1 and LHY expression. Furthermore, PRR9, PRR7, and PRR5 associate with the CCA1 and LHY promoters in vivo, coincident with the timing of decreased CCA1 and LHY expression. These results suggest that the repressor activities of PRR9, PRR7, and PRR5 on the CCA1 and LHY promoter regions constitute the molecular mechanism that accounts for the role of these proteins in the feedback loop of the circadian clock."

60,The Plant cell ,16617099; ,"Circadian clocks maintain robust and accurate timing over a broad range of physiological temperatures, a characteristic termed temperature compensation. In Arabidopsis thaliana, ambient temperature affects the rhythmic accumulation of transcripts encoding the clock components TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1), GIGANTEA (GI), and the partially redundant genes CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY). The amplitude and peak levels increase for TOC1 and GI RNA rhythms as the temperature increases (from 17 to 27 degrees C), whereas they decrease for LHY. However, as temperatures decrease (from 17 to 12 degrees C), CCA1 and LHY RNA rhythms increase in amplitude and peak expression level. At 27 degrees C, a dynamic balance between GI and LHY allows temperature compensation in wild-type plants, but circadian function is impaired in lhy and gi mutant plants. However, at 12 degrees C, CCA1 has more effect on the buffering mechanism than LHY, as the cca1 and gi mutations impair circadian rhythms more than lhy at the lower temperature. At 17 degrees C, GI is apparently dispensable for free-running circadian rhythms, although partial GI function can affect circadian period. Numerical simulations using the interlocking-loop model show that balancing LHY/CCA1 function against GI and other evening-expressed genes can largely account for temperature compensation in wild-type plants and the temperature-specific phenotypes of gi mutants."

Most of the assayed rhythms in 9 mo sugarcane peaked >1 h later than in 4 mo sugarcane, including rhythms of the circadian clock gene, LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY). We hypothesized that older sugarcane perceives dawn later than younger sugarcane as a consequence of self-shading. As a test, we measured LHY rhythms in plants on the east and the west sides of a field. We also tested if a wooden wall built between lines of sugarcane plants changed their rhythms. The LHY peak was delayed in the plants in the west of the field or beyond the wall; both shaded at dawn. We conclude that plants in the same field may have different phases resulting from field microenvironments, impacting important agronomical traits, such as flowering time, stalk weight and number."
63,Plant physiology ,19218364; ,"The circadian clock is an endogenous mechanism that coordinates biological processes with daily and seasonal changes in the environment. Heterodimerization of central clock components is an important way of controlling clock function in several different circadian systems. CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) are Myb-related proteins that function in or close to the central oscillator in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Single mutants of cca1 and lhy have a phenotype of short-period rhythms. cca1 lhy double mutants show an even shorter period phenotype than the cca1 single mutant, suggesting that CCA1 and LHY are only partially functionally redundant. To determine whether CCA1 and LHY act in parallel or synergistically in the circadian clock, we examined their expression in both light-grown and etiolated seedlings. We have shown that LHY and CCA1 bind to the same region of the promoter of a Light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein (Lhcb, also known as CAB). CCA1 and LHY can form homodimers, and they also colocalize in the nucleus and heterodimerize in vitro and in vivo. In Arabidopsis, CCA1 and LHY physically interact in a manner independent of photoperiod. Moreover, results from gel filtration chromatography indicate that CCA1 and LHY are present in the same large complex in plants. Taken together, these results imply that CCA1 and LHY function synergistically in regulating circadian rhythms of Arabidopsis."

To understand the effect of loss of cardiac DDT in experimental heart failure, cardiomyocyte-specific DDT-KO (DDT-cKO) and littermate control mice underwent surgical transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to induce cardiac pressure overload. DDT-cKO mice developed more rapid cardiac contractile dysfunction, greater cardiac dilatation, and pulmonary edema after TAC. Cardiomyocytes from DDT-cKO mice after TAC had impaired contractility, calcium transients, and reduced expression of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase. The DDT-cKO hearts also exhibited diminished angiogenesis with reduced capillary density and lower VEGF-A expression after TAC. In pharmacological studies, recombinant DDT (rDDT) activated endothelial cell ERK1/2 and Akt signaling and had proangiogenic effects in vitro. The DDT-cKO hearts also demonstrated more interstitial fibrosis with enhanced collagen and connective tissue growth factor expression after TAC. In cardiac fibroblasts, rDDT had an antifibrotic action by inhibiting TGF-β-induced Smad-2 activation. Thus, endogenous cardiomyocyte DDT has pleiotropic actions that are protective against heart failure."

Previous studies have shown that CCA1 consists of two abundant splice variants, fully spliced CCA1α and intron-retaining CCA1β. CCA1β is believed to form a nonfunctional heterodimer with CCA1α and its closed-related homolog LHY. Many studies have established that CCA1β is a transcription product, while how CCA1β protein is produced and how two CCA1 isoforms respond to environmental cues have not been elucidated. In this study, we identified CCA1α and CCA1β protein variants under different photoperiods with warm or cold temperature cycles, respectively. Our results showed that CCA1 protein production is regulated by prolonged light exposure and warm temperature. The protein levels of CCA1α and CCA1β peak in the morning, but the detection of CCA1β is dependent on immunoprecipitation enrichment at 22 °C. Higher temperature of 37 °C promotes CCA1β protein production and causes its retention to be detectable in the cytoplasm. Overall, our results indicate that two splice variants of the CCA1 protein respond to environmental light and temperature signals and may, therefore, maintain the circadian rhythms and give individuals the ability to adapt to environment."

More specifically this review summarized novel materials capable of producing an elevated response to low energy stimuli that are being extensively studied globally in recent years. Subsequently, the electro-response gels formulated by reinforcing selective materials such as electro-active polymers, conductive polymers, and piezoelectric materials were discussed.

Here, we analyzed the proteome of the Arabidopsis thaliana mutant genotypes collected in the middle of the day and the middle of the night, including four mutants in the phytochrome (phyA, phyB, phyC, and phyD) and the circadian clock protein LHY. Our approach provided a novel insight into the diel regulations, identifying 640 significant changes in the night-day protein abundance. The comparison with previous studies confirmed that a large portion of identified proteins was a known target of diurnal regulation. However, more than 300 were novel oscillations hidden under standard growth chamber conditions or not manifested in the wild type. Our results indicated a prominent role for ROS metabolism and phytohormone cytokinin in the observed regulations, and the consecutive analyses confirmed that. The cytokinin signaling significantly increased at night, and in the mutants, the hydrogen peroxide content was lower, and the night-day variation seemed to be lost in the phyD genotype. Furthermore, regulations in the lhy and phyB mutants were partially similar to those found in the catalase mutant cat2, indicating shared ROS-mediated signaling pathways.

Therefore, a better understanding of the dragon fruit SI mechanism is needed to improve breeding efficiency and ultimate production costs. To reveal the underlying mechanisms of SI in dragon fruit, plant anatomy, de novo RNA sequencing-based transcriptomic analysis, and multiple bioinformatic approaches were used to analyze gene expression in the pistils of the self-pollinated and cross-pollinated dragon fruit flowers at different intervals of time after pollination. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observed that the pollen of 'Hongshuijing', a self-incompatible dragon fruit variety (S. monacanthus), germinated on its own stigma. However, the pollen tube elongation has ceased at 1/2 of the style, confirming that dragon fruit experiences gametophyte self-incompatibility (GSI). We found that the pollen tube elongation in vitro was inhibited by self-style glycoproteins in the SI variety, indicating that glycoproteins were involved in SI. That is to say the female S factor should be homologous of S-RNase or PrsS (P. rhoeas stigma S factor), both of which are glycoproteins and are the female S factors of the two known GSI mechanism respectively. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that among the 43,954 assembled unigenes from pistil, there were six S-RNase genes, while 158 F-box genes were identified from a pollen transcriptomic dataset. There were no P. rhoeas type S genes discovered. Thus, the identified S-RNase and F-box represent the candidate female and male S genes, respectively. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the self and cross-pollinated pistils at different time intervals led to the identification of 6,353 genes. We then used a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to find some non-S locus genes in SI responses in dragon fruit. Additionally, 13 transcription factors (TFs) (YABBY4, ANL2, ERF43, ARF2, BLH7, KNAT6, PIF3, two OBF1, two HY5 and two LHY/CCA) were identified to be involved in dragon fruit GSI. Thus, we uncovered candidate S and non-S genes and predicted more SI-related genes for a more detailed investigation of the molecular mechanism of dragon fruit SI. Our findings suggest that dragon fruit possesses a GSI system and involves some unique regulators.

However, nitrogen starvation and excessive nitrogen stress can cause stunted growth and development of walnut seedlings, and environmental pollution is also of concern. Therefore, it is necessary to study the mechanism of walnut seedling resistance to nitrogen stress. In this study, morphological and physiological observations and transcriptome sequencing of walnut seedlings under nitrogen starvation and excess nitrogen stress were performed. The results showed that walnut seedlings under nitrogen starvation and excess stress could adapt to the changes in the nitrogen environment by changing the coordination of their root morphology and physiological indexes. Based on an analysis of transcriptome data, 4911 differential genes (DEGs) were obtained (2180 were upregulated and 2731 were downregulated) in a comparison of nitrogen starvation and control groups. A total of 9497 DEGs (5091 upregulated and 4406 downregulated) were obtained in the comparison between the nitrogen overdose and control groups. When these DEGs were analysed, the differential genes in both groups were found to be significantly enriched in the plant's circadian pathway. Therefore, we selected the circadian rhythm as the focus for further analysis. We made some discoveries by analysing the gene co-expression network of nitrogen metabolism, circadian rhythm, and hormone signal transduction. (a) Nitrite nitrogen (NO2-) or Glu may act as a nitrogen signal to the circadian clock. (b) Nitrogen signalling may be input into the circadian clock by regulating changes in the abundance of the CRY1 gene. (c) After the nitrogen signal enters the circadian clock, the expression of the LHY gene is upregulated, which causes a phase shift in the circadian clock. (d) The RVE protein may send information about the circadian clock's response to nitrogen stress back to the nitrogen metabolic pathway via the hormone transduction pathway. In conclusion, various metabolic pathways in the roots of walnut seedlings coordinated with one another to resist the ill effects of nitrogen stress on the root cells, and these coordination relationships were regulated by the circadian clock. This study is expected to provide valuable information on the circadian clock regulation of plant resistance to nitrogen stress."

To identify genes with circadian rhythm we sequenced the transcriptomes of gemmalings in a time series in constant light conditions. Subsequently, we performed functional studies using loss-of-function mutants and gene expression reporters. Among the genes displaying circadian rhythm, a homologue to the transcriptional co-repressor Arabidopsis DE-ETIOLATED1 showed high amplitude and morning phase. Because AtDET1 is arrhythmic and associated with the morning gene function of AtCCA1/LHY, that lack a homologue in liverworts, we functionally studied DET1 in M. polymorpha. We found that the circadian rhythm of MpDET1 expression is disrupted in loss-of-function mutants of core clock genes and putative evening-complex genes. MpDET1 knock-down in turn results in altered circadian rhythm of nyctinastic thallus movement and clock gene expression. We could not detect any effect of MpDET1 knock-down on circadian response to light, suggesting that MpDET1 has a yet unknown function in the M. polymorpha circadian clock."

However, PERI has been rarely demonstrated for well established species drawn from different genera. In particular, parallel molecular signatures for the same genes in response to similar habitat divergence in such different lineages is lacking. Here, based on whole-genome sequencing data, we first explore the speciation process in two sister species of Carpinus (Betulaceae) in response to divergence for temperature and soil-iron concentration in habitats they occupy in northern and southwestern China, respectively. We then determine whether parallel molecular mutations occur during speciation in this pair of species and also in another sister-species pair of the related genus, Ostryopsis, which occupy similarly divergent habitats in China. We show that gene flow occurred during the origin of both pairs of sister species since approximately 9.8 or approximately 2 million years ago, implying strong natural selection during divergence. Also, in both species pairs we detected concurrent positive selection in a gene (LHY) for flowering time and in two paralogous genes (FRO4 and FRO7) of a gene family known to be important for iron tolerance. These changes were in addition to changes in other major genes related to these two traits. The different alleles of these particular candidate genes possessed by the sister species of Carpinus were functionally tested and indicated likely to alter flowering time and iron tolerance as previously demonstrated in the pair of Ostryopsis sister species. Allelic changes in these genes may have effectively resulted in high levels of prezygotic reproductive isolation to evolve between sister species of each pair. Our results show that PERI can occur in different genera at different timescales and involve similar signatures of molecular evolution at genes or paralogues of the same gene family, causing reproductive isolation as a consequence of adaptation to similarly divergent habitats."

However, NO-induced late-flowering does not require FNR1 or CRY1. Sucrose supply counteracts the flowering delay induced by NO. However high-N-induced late-flowering could not be reversed by 5% sucrose supplementation. The high nitrogen condition decreased the amplitudes of all transcripts of the circadian clock. While NO increased the amplitudes of circadian transcripts of CRY1, LHY (LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL), CCA1 (CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1) and TOC1 (TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1), but decreased the amplitudes of circadian transcripts of CO (CONSTANS) and GI (GIGANTEA). 5% sucrose supplementation reversed the declines in amplitudes of circadian transcripts of CO and GI after the NO treatment. NO induced S-nitrosation modification on oscillators CO and GI, but not on the other oscillators of the circadian clock. Sucrose supply interestingly reduced S-nitrosation levels of GI and CO proteins. Thus N and NO rely on overlapping but distinct signaling pathways on plant flowering."

Leveraging chromosome-resolved plant genomes and syntenic ortholog analysis enabled tracing this genetic linkage back to Amborella trichopoda, a sister lineage to the angiosperm, and identifying an additional evolutionarily conserved genetic linkage in light signaling genes. The LHY/CCA1-PRR5/9, RVE4/8-PRR3/7, and PIF3-PHYA genetic linkages emerged in the bryophyte lineage and progressively moved within several genes of each other across an array of angiosperm families representing distinct whole-genome duplication and fractionation events. Soybean (Glycine max) maintained all but two genetic linkages, and expression analysis revealed the PIF3-PHYA linkage overlapping with the E4 maturity group locus was the only pair to robustly cycle with an evening phase, in contrast to the sMYB-PRR morning and midday phase. While most monocots maintain the genetic linkages, they have been lost in the economically important grasses (Poaceae), such as maize (Zea mays), where the genes have been fractionated to separate chromosomes and presence/absence variation results in the segregation of PRR7 paralogs across heterotic groups. The environmental robustness model is put forward, suggesting that evolutionarily conserved genetic linkages ensure superior microhabitat pollinator synchrony, while wide-hybrids or unlinking the genes, as seen in the grasses, result in heterosis, adaptation, and colonization of new ecological niches."

Tof16 and the previously identified J locus genetically additively but independently control yield under short-day conditions. More than 80% accessions in low latitude harbor the mutations of tof16 and j, which suggests that loss of functions of Tof16 and J are the major genetic basis of soybean adaptation into tropics.

Of the plant hormones, IAA and JA-Ile and their related transcription factors (MYC2 and SAUR21) were significantly correlated with IspS gene expression. Concentrations of cytokinins, isopentenyladenine (iP), trans-zeatin riboside (tZR) and cis-zeatin riboside (cZR), were similarly significantly correlated with IspS expression. However, there was no significant correlation between their related transcription factor (ARR-B) and IspS expression. The circadian clock-related gene PRR7, but not the transcription factor LHY, was highly correlated with IspS expression. These results suggest that the hormonal balance between JA-Ile and IAA plays a central role in transcriptional regulation of IspS through the transcription factors MYC2 and SAUR21, the early auxin responsive genes. The putative cis-acting elements for SAUR on the IspS promoter (TGTCNN and CATATG), in addition to the G-box for MYC2, support the above proposal.

Water supply determines Height variation (P = 0.000) but not CA (P = 0.2 in partial correlation). The decoupled functions of stem, hydraulic conductance and leaf spatial arrangement, may explain the inconsistency, which may further ensure hydraulic safety and carbon assimilation, avoiding forest dieback. Works on tree allometry pattern and determinant will effectively supply tree drought tolerance studying and support DGVM improvements."
91,Biochemical and biophysical research communications ,32430181; ,"Circadian clock controls plant behaviors to anticipate day-night switch and keeps plant fitness. Here, we reported that plant response to auxin is also strictly governed by clock. The amplitude of auxin-responsive gene expressions gradually declined from morning to the dusk, and then enhanced from dusk to dawn. Plants with defects in both CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and its closest homologue LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) (cca1 lhy) showed comparable responses to auxin at different time points in consecutive days, suggesting that CCA1 and LHY were required for gating auxin responses. Moreover, CCA1/LHY physically interacted with the core transcriptional repressors (Aux/IAA proteins), which might further modulate plant sensitivity to auxin. Taken together, we demonstrate that the central morning phased circadian oscillator CCA1 plays a pivotal role in gating auxin response."
92,The Science of the total environment ,28645048; ,"Terrestrial biogeochemical carbon (C) sequestration is coupled with the biogeochemical silicon (Si) cycle through mechanisms such as phytolith C sequestration, but the size and distribution of the phytolith C sink remain unclear. Here, we estimate phytolith C sequestration in global terrestrial biomes. We used biome data including productivity, phytolith and silica contents, and the phytolith stability factor to preliminarily determine the size and distribution of the phytolith C sink in global terrestrial biomes. Total phytolith C sequestration in global terrestrial biomes is 156.7±91.6TgCO2yr-1. Grassland (40%), cropland (35%), and forest (20%) biomes are the dominant producers of phytolith-based carbon; geographically, the main contributors are Asia (31%), Africa (24%), and South America (17%). Practices such as bamboo afforestation/reforestation and grassland recovery for economic and ecological purposes could theoretically double the above phytolith C sink. The potential terrestrial phytolith C sequestration during 2000-2099 under such practices would be 15.7-40.5PgCO2, equivalent in magnitude to the C sequestration of oceanic diatoms in sediments and through silicate weathering. Phytolith C sequestration contributes vitally to the global C cycle, hence, it is essential to incorporate plant-soil silica cycling in biogeochemical C cycle models."
93,Nature communications ,27734958; ,"A double-negative feedback loop formed by the morning genes CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1)/LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and the evening gene TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1) contributes to regulation of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis. A 24-h circadian cycle starts with the peak expression of CCA1 at dawn. Although CCA1 is targeted by multiple transcriptional repressors, including PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR9 (PRR9), PRR7, PRR5 and CCA1 HIKING EXPEDITION (CHE), activators of CCA1 remain elusive. Here we use mathematical modelling to infer a co-activator role for LIGHT-REGULATED WD1 (LWD1) in CCA1 expression. We show that the TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1-CYCLOIDEA-PCF20 (TCP20) and TCP22 proteins act as LWD-interacting transcriptional activators. The concomitant binding of LWD1 and TCP20/TCP22 to the TCP-binding site in the CCA1 promoter activates CCA1. Our study reveals activators of the morning gene CCA1 and provides an action mechanism that ensures elevated expression of CCA1 at dawn to sustain a robust clock."
94,BMC genomics ,35392804; ,"Helictotrichon virescens is a perennial grass that is primarily distributed in high altitude areas of 2000 ~ 4500 m. It is widely cultivated in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China, strongly resistant to cold, and an essential part of the wild herbs in this region. However, the molecular mechanism of the response of H. virescens to low temperature stress and the key regulatory genes for specific biological processes are poorly understood."
95,Nature communications ,31308379; ,"Light and temperature are two important environmental signals to plants. After dawn, photo-activated phytochromes translocate into the nucleus and interact with a family of negative basic helix-loop-helix PIF regulators. Subsequent phosphorylation and degradation of PIFs triggers a series of photomorphogenic responses. However, excess light can damage the photosynthetic apparatus and leads to photoinhibition. Plants acclimate to a balanced state of photomorphogenesis to avoid photodamage. Here, we show that upregulation of PIF4 expression by SHB1 and CCA1 under red light represents a desensitization step. After dawn, the highly expressed circadian clock protein CCA1 brings circadian signals to the regulatory region of the PIF4 signaling hub. Recruitment of SHB1 by CCA1 modulates red light-specific induction of PIF4 expression thus integrating circadian and light signals. As noon approaches and light intensity and ambient temperature tend to increase, the SHB1-CCA1 interaction sustains PIF4 expression to trigger thermomorphogenic responses to changing light and temperature conditions."

GENOME UNCOUPLED 4 (GUN4) has been shown to be required for the regulation of both chlorophyll synthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis and plastid retrograde signaling. In this study, we found that growth of the gun4 mutant was significantly improved under medium strong light (200 μmol photons m-2s-1) compared to normal light (100 μmol photons m-2s-1), in marked contrast to wild-type (WT). Further analysis revealed that GUN4 interacts with SIGNAL RECOGNITION PARTICLE 54 KDA SUBUNIT (SRP43) and SRP54. RNA-seq analysis indicated that the expression of genes for light signaling and the circadian clock is altered in gun4 compared with (WT). qPCR analysis confirmed that the expression of the clock genes CLOCK-RELATED 1 (CCA1), LATE ELONGATION HYPOCOTYL (LHY), TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1) and PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 7 (PRR7) is significantly changed in the gun4 and srp54 mutants under normal and medium strong light conditions. These results suggest that GUN4 may coordinate the adaptation of plants to changing light conditions by regulating the biological clock, although it is not clear whether the effect is direct or indirect."

99,Frontiers in plant science ,36311064; ,"Alternative splicing (AS) is an important regulatory process that affects plant development and stress responses by greatly increasing the complexity of transcriptome and proteome. To understand how the AS landscape of B. napus changes in response to abiotic stresses, we investigated 26 RNA-seq libraries, including control and treatments with cold, dehydration, salt, and abscisic acid (ABA) at two different time points, to perform comparative alternative splicing analysis. Apparently, AS events increased under all stresses except dehydration for 1 h, and intron retention was the most common AS mode. In addition, a total of 357 differential alternative splicing (DAS) genes were identified under four abiotic stresses, among which 81 DAS genes existed in at least two stresses, and 276 DAS genes were presented under only one stress. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) based on the splicing isoforms, rather than the genes, pinpointed out 23 co-expression modules associated with different abiotic stresses. Among them, a number of significant hub genes were also found to be DAS genes, which encode key isoforms involved in responses to single stress or multiple stresses, including RNA-binding proteins, transcription factors, and other important genes, such as RBP45C, LHY, MYB59, SCL30A, RS40, MAJ23.10, and DWF4. The splicing isoforms of candidate genes identified in this study could be a valuable resource for improving tolerance of B. napus against multiple abiotic stresses."
