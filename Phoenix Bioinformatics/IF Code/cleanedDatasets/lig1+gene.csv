0,Cancer discovery ,36001024; ,"Microscaled proteogenomics was deployed to probe the molecular basis for differential response to neoadjuvant carboplatin and docetaxel combination chemotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Proteomic analyses of pretreatment patient biopsies uniquely revealed metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation, adipogenesis, and fatty acid metabolism, that were associated with resistance. Both proteomics and transcriptomics revealed that sensitivity was marked by elevation of DNA repair, E2F targets, G2-M checkpoint, interferon-gamma signaling, and immune-checkpoint components. Proteogenomic analyses of somatic copy-number aberrations identified a resistance-associated 19q13.31-33 deletion where LIG1, POLD1, and XRCC1 are located. In orthogonal datasets, LIG1 (DNA ligase I) gene deletion and/or low mRNA expression levels were associated with lack of pathologic complete response, higher chromosomal instability index (CIN), and poor prognosis in TNBC, as well as carboplatin-selective resistance in TNBC preclinical models. Hemizygous loss of LIG1 was also associated with higher CIN and poor prognosis in other cancer types, demonstrating broader clinical implications."
1,Mutagenesis ,31630206; ,"The joining of interruptions in the phosphodiester backbone of DNA is critical to maintain genome stability. These breaks, which are generated as part of normal DNA transactions, such as DNA replication, V(D)J recombination and meiotic recombination as well as directly by DNA damage or due to DNA damage removal, are ultimately sealed by one of three human DNA ligases. DNA ligases I, III and IV each function in the nucleus whereas DNA ligase III is the sole enzyme in mitochondria. While the identification of specific protein partners and the phenotypes caused either by genetic or chemical inactivation have provided insights into the cellular functions of the DNA ligases and evidence for significant functional overlap in nuclear DNA replication and repair, different results have been obtained with mouse and human cells, indicating species-specific differences in the relative contributions of the DNA ligases. Inherited mutations in the human LIG1 and LIG4 genes that result in the generation of polypeptides with partial activity have been identified as the causative factors in rare DNA ligase deficiency syndromes that share a common clinical symptom, immunodeficiency. In the case of DNA ligase IV, the immunodeficiency is due to a defect in V(D)J recombination whereas the cause of the immunodeficiency due to DNA ligase I deficiency is not known. Overexpression of each of the DNA ligases has been observed in cancers. For DNA ligase I, this reflects increased proliferation. Elevated levels of DNA ligase III indicate an increased dependence on an alternative non-homologous end-joining pathway for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks whereas elevated level of DNA ligase IV confer radioresistance due to increased repair of DNA double-strand breaks by the major non-homologous end-joining pathway. Efforts to determine the potential of DNA ligase inhibitors as cancer therapeutics are on-going in preclinical cancer models."
2,Journal of genetics ,25189241; ,"Elucidation of the genetic diversity and relatedness of the subpopulations of India may provide a unique resource for future analysis of genetic association of several critical community-specific complex diseases.We performed a comprehensive exploration of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the gene DNA ligase 1 (LIG1) among a multiethnic panel of Indian subpopulations representative of the ethnic, linguistic and geographical diversity of India using a two-stage design involving DNA resequencing-based SNP discovery followed by SNP validation using sequenom-based genotyping. Thirty SNPs were identified in LIG1 gene using DNA resequencing including three promoter SNPs and one coding SNP. Following SNP validation, the SNPs rs20580/C19008A and rs3730862/C8804T were found to have the most widespread prevalence with noticeable variations in minor allele frequencies both between the Indian subpopulation groups and also from those reported on other major world populations. Subsequently, SNPs found in Indian subpopulations were analysed using bioinformatics-based approaches and compared with SNP data available on major world populations. Further, we also performed genotype-phenotype association analysis of LIG1 SNPs with publicly available data on LIG1 mRNA expression in HapMap samples. Results showed polymorphisms in LIG1 affect its expression and may therefore change its function. Our results stress upon the uniqueness of the Indian population with respect to the worldwide scenario and suggest that any epidemiological study undertaken on the global population should take this distinctiveness in consideration and avoid making generalized conclusions."
3,Cell biochemistry and biophysics ,27352326; ,"Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is one of the pathways used to repair the DNA double-strand breaks. A number of genes involved in NHEJ have been implicated as lung cancer susceptibility genes such as the LIG1. However, some studies have generated conflicting results. The aim of this review and meta-analysis was to investigate the association between the LIG1 gene polymorphism and lung cancer risk. Studies focusing on the relationship between the LIG1 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to lung cancer were selected from several electronic databases, with the last search up to October 25, 2014. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers, and the meta-analysis was performed with STATA version 12.0 software, calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs). According to the inclusion criteria, we included ten studies with a total of 4012 lung cancer cases and 5629 healthy controls in the meta-analysis. The results showed that the rs156641 polymorphism was significantly associated with lung cancer risk (dominant model: OR 0.694, 95 % CI 0.549-0.878; homozygote model: OR 0.677, 95 % CI 0.526-0.871; heterozygote model: OR 0.712, 95 % CI 0.556-0.913; additive model: OR 0.859, 95 % CI 0.767-0.962), whereas no association was found between rs3730931/rs439132/rs20579 polymorphisms and lung cancer. Our meta-analysis suggested that the rs156641 polymorphism in the LIG1 gene might be associated with an increased risk of lung cancer."
4,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology ,30181552; ,"In recent years, the relevance of RNA metabolism has been increasingly recognized in a variety of diseases. Modifications in the levels of RNA-binding proteins elicit changes in the expression of cancer-related genes. Here we evaluate whether SRSF1 regulates the expression of DNA repair genes, and whether this regulation has a relevant role in lung carcinogenesis. An in silico analysis was performed to evaluate the association between the expression of SRSF1 and DNA repair genes. In vitro functional analyses were conducted in SRSF1 or DNA ligase 1 (LIG1)-downregulated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. In addition, the prognostic value of LIG1 was evaluated in NSCLC patients by immunohistochemistry. We found a significant correlation between the DNA repair gene LIG1 and SRSF1 in NSCLC cell lines. Moreover, SRSF1 binds to LIG1 mRNA and regulates its expression by increasing its mRNA stability and enhancing its translation in an mTOR-dependent manner. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated LIG1 inhibition reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis of NSCLC cells. Finally, the expression of LIG1 was an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC, as confirmed in a series of 210 patients. These results show that LIG1 is regulated by the oncoprotein SRSF1 and plays a relevant role in lung cancer cell proliferation and progression. LIG1 is associated with poor prognosis in non-small lung cancer patients."
5,Current genetics ,10447599; ,"Lig1 was found in a differential-display screen for early genes expressed during phytochrome-controlled sporulation of Physarum polycephalum plasmodia. A stretch of 218 amino acids of the predicted sequence of Lig1 shares 32% sequence identity to that of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cell-cycle and DNA-damage checkpoint gene hus1. In addition Lig1 is homologous to proteins of unknown function in Homo sapiens (35% identity) and Mus musculus (31% identity). Induction of lig1 expression was found to be controlled downstream from the point of integration of the phytochrome-activated pathway and the pathway sensing the metabolic state, but upstream of the developmental switch. The lig1 expression level in individual plasmodia correlated positively with the probability to sporulate. Sensory control of the lig1 expression level and its association with the developmental switch suggests a possible mechanism for the coordination of differentiation and the control of cell-cycle progression during the sporulation of P. polycephalum."
6,International journal of radiation biology ,32149571; ,"Background: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) at DNA repair genes are considered as potential biomarkers of radio-sensitivity. The coastal belt of Kerala in south west India has a patchy distribution of monazite in its beach sand that contains Th-232 and its decay products. Thus, radiation levels in this area vary from <1.0mGy to 45.0mGy/year. The areas with external gamma radiation dose >1.5mGy/year are considered as High-Level Natural Radiation Areas (HLNRA) and ≤ 1.5mGy/year are Normal Level Natural Radiation Area (NLNRA).Objective: In the present study, an attempt was made to evaluate the influence of chronic low dose radiation exposure on DNA repair gene polymorphisms in NLNRA and HLNRA population of Kerala coast.Materials and methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from venous blood samples of 246 random, healthy individuals (NLNRA, N = 104; HLNRA, N = 142) and genotyping of five SNPs such as X-ray repair cross complementing 1(XRCC1 Arg399Gln), X-ray repair cross complementing 3 (XRCC3 Thr241Met], Protein kinase, DNA-activated, catalytic subunit (PRKDC) (X-ray repair cross-complementing group 7, XRCC7 G/T), nei like DNA glycosylase 1 (NEIL1 G/T) and DNA ligase 1 (LIG1 A/C) was carried out using PCR based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) followed by silver staining.Results: Our results showed no significant difference in genotype frequencies in HLNRA vs NLNRA at three of the five SNPs studied i.e. XRCC1 Arg399Gln (χ2(2) = 5.85, p = .054), XRCC3 Thr241Met (χ2(1) = 0.71, p = .339), PRKDC (XRCC7 G/T) (χ2(2) = 3.72, p = .156), whereas significant difference was observed at NEIL1 G/T (χ2(2) =8.71, p = .013) and LIG1 A/C (χ2(2) = 7.66, p = .022). The odds of heterozygote to homozygote genotypes in HLNRA relative to NLNRA at XRCC1 Arg399Gln (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.13-3.40), XRCC3 Thr241Met (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.41-1.31), PRKDC (XRCC7 G/T), (OR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.48-1.38), NEIL1 G/T (OR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.31-0.96) and LIG1 A/C (OR = 1.62; 95% CI: 0.97-2.69) was also not significantly different in HLNRA vs NLNRA, except at XRCC1 and NEIL1.Conclusion: The genotype frequencies at three of these SNPs i.e. XRCC1 Arg399Gln, XRCC3 Thr241Met and PRKDC (XRCC7 G/T) were similar, whereas NEIL1 G/T and LIG1 A/C showed significant difference between HLNRA and NLNRA population. However, further research using more number of SNPs in a larger cohort is required in this study area."
7,The Lancet. Neurology ,33098802; ,"Huntington's disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by CAG-CAA repeat expansion, encoding polyglutamine, in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Current age-of-clinical-onset prediction models for Huntington's disease are based on polyglutamine length and explain only a proportion of the variability in age of onset observed between patients. These length-based assays do not interrogate the underlying genetic variation, because known genetic variants in this region do not alter the protein coding sequence. Given that individuals with identical repeat lengths can present with Huntington's disease decades apart, the search for genetic modifiers of clinical age of onset has become an active area of research."
8,3 Biotech ,22558535; ,"A computational approach for identifying functionally relevant SNPs in gene LIG1 has been proposed. LIG1 is a crucial gene which is involved in excision repair pathways and mutations in this gene may lead to increase sensitivity towards DNA damaging agents. A total of 792 SNPs were reported to be associated with gene LIG1 in dbSNP. Different web server namely SIFT, PolyPhen, CUPSAT, FASTSNP, MAPPER and dbSMR were used to identify potentially functional SNPs in gene LIG1. SIFT, PolyPhen and CUPSAT servers predicted eleven nsSNPs to be intolerant, thirteen nsSNP to be damaging and two nsSNPs have the potential to destabilize protein structure. The nsSNP rs11666150 was predicted to be damaging by all three servers and its mutant structure showed significant increase in overall energy. FASTSNP predicted twenty SNPs to be present in splicing modifier binding sites while rSNP module from MAPPER server predicted nine SNPs to influence the binding of transcription factors. The results from the study may provide vital clues in establishing affect of polymorphism on phenotype and in elucidating drug response."
9,Genes ,26110316; ,"Higher eukaryotes have three types of DNA ligases: DNA ligase 1 (Lig1), DNA ligase 3 (Lig3) and DNA ligase 4 (Lig4). While Lig1 and Lig4 are present in all eukaryotes from yeast to human, Lig3 appears sporadically in evolution and is uniformly present only in vertebrates. In the classical, textbook view, Lig1 catalyzes Okazaki-fragment ligation at the DNA replication fork and the ligation steps of long-patch base-excision repair (BER), homologous recombination repair (HRR) and nucleotide excision repair (NER). Lig4 is responsible for DNA ligation at DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by the classical, DNA-PKcs-dependent pathway of non-homologous end joining (C-NHEJ). Lig3 is implicated in a short-patch base excision repair (BER) pathway, in single strand break repair in the nucleus, and in all ligation requirements of the DNA metabolism in mitochondria. In this scenario, Lig1 and Lig4 feature as the major DNA ligases serving the most essential ligation needs of the cell, while Lig3 serves in the cell nucleus only minor repair roles. Notably, recent systematic studies in the chicken B cell line, DT40, involving constitutive and conditional knockouts of all three DNA ligases individually, as well as of combinations thereof, demonstrate that the current view must be revised. Results demonstrate that Lig1 deficient cells proliferate efficiently. Even Lig1/Lig4 double knockout cells show long-term viability and proliferate actively, demonstrating that, at least in DT40, Lig3 can perform all ligation reactions of the cellular DNA metabolism as sole DNA ligase. Indeed, in the absence of Lig1, Lig3 can efficiently support semi-conservative DNA replication via an alternative Okazaki-fragment ligation pathway. In addition, Lig3 can back up NHEJ in the absence of Lig4, and can support NER and HRR in the absence of Lig1. Supporting observations are available in less elaborate genetic models in mouse cells. Collectively, these observations raise Lig3 from a niche-ligase to a universal DNA ligase, which can potentially substitute or backup the repair and replication functions of all other DNA ligases in the cell nucleus. Thus, the old model of functionally dedicated DNA ligases is now replaced by one in which only Lig4 remains dedicated to C-NHEJ, with Lig1 and Lig3 showing an astounding functional flexibility and interchangeability for practically all nuclear ligation functions. The underlying mechanisms of Lig3 versus Lig1 utilization in DNA repair and replication are expected to be partly different and remain to be elucidated."
10,Biochemical and biophysical research communications ,11414704; ,"Growth factor receptors are frequently amplified and over-expressed in various human cancers. Recently, a Drosophila cell surface protein, Kekkon-1, was found to participate in an epidermal growth factor (EGF) driven negative feedback loop. Kekkon-1 is induced by EGF, binds to the EGF-receptor, and inhibits receptor-mediated signaling. Here, we have searched for human genes with homologies to Kekkon-1 and identified human LIG1. The gene is the human homologue of mouse Lig-1 and is located on chromosome band 3p14, a region frequently deleted in various human cancers. It is predicted to encode a transmembrane cell-surface protein with extracellular leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains. LIG1 mRNA was detected in all tissues analyzed. The highest and lowest relative expression levels were found in brain and spleen, respectively, and differed by more than 200-fold. Taken together, our data are compatible with a role for LIG1 as a growth and tumor suppressor in human tissues."
11,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine ,24929328; ,"To investigate the association of LIG1 with the risk of lung cancer, all subjects of unrelated ethnic Han Chinese in Liaoning Province were involved in a hospital-based case-control study. The case group consisted of 370 histologically diagnosed lung cancer patients; 314 controls were selected from cancer-free patients during Dec. 2009 to Dec. 2011. LIG1 rs1050298SNP were analyzed by TaqMan real-time PCR method. All statistical analyses were performed with Statistical Product and Service Solution sv13.0 (SPSS). The genotype distribution frequency of LIG1 rs1050298 SNP displayed significant difference between the case and the control group. Individuals carrying the LIG1 rs1050298 T genotype had higher risks of lung cancer, especially those with squamous cell carcinoma."
12,DNA repair ,33087274; ,"To ensure genome integrity, the joining of breaks in the phosphodiester backbone of duplex DNA is required during DNA replication and to complete the repair of almost all types of DNA damage. In human cells, this task is accomplished by DNA ligases encoded by three genes, LIG1, LIG3 and LIG4. Mutations in LIG1 and LIG4 have been identified as the causative factor in two inherited immunodeficiency syndromes. Moreover, there is emerging evidence that DNA ligases may be good targets for the development of novel anti-cancer agents. In this graphical review, we provide an overview of the roles of the DNA ligases encoded by the three human LIG genes in DNA replication and repair."
13,Neuropsychobiology ,27010693; ,"One of the factors that contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the DNA damage caused by oxidative stress and inflammation that occurs in nerve cells. It has been suggested that the risk of AD may be associated with an age-dependent reduction of the DNA repair efficiency. Base excision repair (BER) is, among other things, a main repair system of oxidative DNA damage. One of the reasons for the reduced efficiency of this system may be single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the genes encoding its proteins."
14,Plant physiology ,26269544; ,"Targeted mutagenesis, editing of endogenous maize (Zea mays) genes, and site-specific insertion of a trait gene using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated (Cas)-guide RNA technology are reported in maize. DNA vectors expressing maize codon-optimized Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 endonuclease and single guide RNAs were cointroduced with or without DNA repair templates into maize immature embryos by biolistic transformation targeting five different genomic regions: upstream of the liguleless1 (LIG1) gene, male fertility genes (Ms26 and Ms45), and acetolactate synthase (ALS) genes (ALS1 and ALS2). Mutations were subsequently identified at all sites targeted, and plants containing biallelic multiplex mutations at LIG1, Ms26, and Ms45 were recovered. Biolistic delivery of guide RNAs (as RNA molecules) directly into immature embryo cells containing preintegrated Cas9 also resulted in targeted mutations. Editing the ALS2 gene using either single-stranded oligonucleotides or double-stranded DNA vectors as repair templates yielded chlorsulfuron-resistant plants. Double-strand breaks generated by RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease also stimulated insertion of a trait gene at a site near LIG1 by homology-directed repair. Progeny showed expected Mendelian segregation of mutations, edits, and targeted gene insertions. The examples reported in this study demonstrate the utility of Cas9-guide RNA technology as a plant genome editing tool to enhance plant breeding and crop research needed to meet growing agriculture demands of the future."
15,"Structure (London, England : 1993) ",30639225; ,"The protein UHRF1 is crucial for DNA methylation maintenance. The tandem Tudor domain (TTD) of UHRF1 binds histone H3K9me2/3 with micromolar affinity, as well as unmethylated linker regions within UHRF1 itself, causing auto-inhibition. Recently, we showed that a methylated histone-like region of DNA ligase 1 (LIG1K126me2/me3) binds the UHRF1 TTD with nanomolar affinity, permitting UHRF1 recruitment to chromatin. Here we report the crystal structure of the UHRF1 TTD bound to a LIG1K126me3 peptide. The data explain the basis for the high TTD-binding affinity of LIG1K126me3 and reveal that the interaction may be regulated by phosphorylation. Binding of LIG1K126me3 switches the overall structure of UHRF1 from a closed to a flexible conformation, suggesting that auto-inhibition is relieved. Our results provide structural insight into how UHRF1 performs its key function in epigenetic maintenance."
16,Frontiers in immunology ,36341401; ,"DNA ligase I deficiency is an extremely rare primary immunodeficiency with only 6 patients reported in the literature. Most common manifestations include radiosensitivity, macrocytic anemia, lymphopenia with an increased percentage of gamma-delta T cells, and hypogammaglobulinemia requiring replacement therapy. Two-month-old girl with delayed development, T-B-NK+ SCID, and macrocytic anemia presented features of Omenn syndrome. Whole exome sequencing revealed two novel, heterozygous variants (c.2312 G&gt;A, p.Arg771Gly and c.776+5G&gt;T, p.Pro260*) in the LIG1 gene (NM_000234.1). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a fully matched unrelated donor was performed at the age of 4 months using GEFA03 protocol. Mixed donor-recipient chimerism was observed, with 60-70% chimerism in the mononucleated cell compartment and over 90% in T-lymphocyte compartment, but autologous myeloid recovery. Stable CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts above 200/µL were achieved after 2 months, but the patient remained transfusion-dependent. Despite satisfactory immunological reconstitution, the second transplantation due to constitutional hemolytic defect has been considered. In light of possible re-transplantation, an issue of optimal conditioning protocol with sufficient myeloid engraftment is important. For the first time Omenn syndrome is described in a compound heterozygote carrying two the novel variants p.Arg771Gly and p.Pro260* in the LIG1 gene. Patients diagnosed with SCID and Omenn syndrome showing macrocytic anemia, should be screened for DNA ligase I deficiency."
17,"BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology ",9363683; ,"DNA joining enzymes play an essential role in the maintenance of genomic integrity and stability. Three mammalian genes encoding DNA ligases, LIG1, LIG3 and LIG4, have been identified. Since DNA ligase II appears to be derived from DNA ligase III by a proteolytic mechanism, the three LIG genes can account for the four biochemically distinct DNA ligase activities, DNA ligases I, II, III and IV, that have been purified from mammalian cell extracts. It is probable that the specific cellular roles of these enzymes are determined by the proteins with which they interact. The specific involvement of DNA ligase I in DNA replication is mediated by the non-catalytic amino-terminal domain of this enzyme. Furthermore, DNA ligase I participates in DNA base excision repair as a component of a multiprotein complex. Two forms of DNA ligase III are produced by an alternative splicing mechanism. The ubiqitously expressed DNA ligase III-alpha forms a complex with the DNA single-strand break repair protein XRCC1. In contrast, DNA ligase III-beta, which does not interact with XRCC1, is only expressed in male meiotic germ cells, suggesting a role for this isoform in meiotic recombination. At present, there is very little information about the cellular functions of DNA ligase IV."
18,Mutation research ,9920050; ,"Sequencing of a human DNA ligase I cDNA clone derived from HeLa cells revealed two unreported differences with the published sequence: a single base change and a three-base deletion. Both differences are in exon 6, and were analyzed by amplifying a segment containing exon 5, intron 6, and exon 6. The first finding was that intron 6 is approximately 2.6 kb in size, not the 1 kb reported in the literature. By sequence analysis of amplified segments, the single-base difference in exon 6 was shown to be polymorphic, with HeLa cells heterozygous for the A/C difference. Analysis of 60 unrelated individuals found a frequency of 0.5 for each allele. Primer extension reactions across the exon 5/exon 6 boundary were performed on cDNA obtained from HeLa cells and human thymus. The results show that the three-base deletion is due to a variation in splicing. For both HeLa and thymus, two-thirds of the transcripts are like the published cDNA sequence and one-third have the three-base deletion. Finally, sequencing of part of intron 6 revealed the presence of a complex GT repeat consisting of a 48-50 nucleotide polypurine tract followed by a variable number of GT residues. This entire unit of polypurine tract plus GTs is repeated three times. Detection of the repeated sequences required the development of specialized cloning and PCR conditions. Analysis of a pedigree showed that this complex repeat is polymorphic."

20,Journal of otology ,35847575; ,"The etiology and underlying mechanism of Meniere's disease (MD) development are still unknown, although inflammation and autoimmunity have been implicated as underlying mechanisms. The human endolymphatic sac (ES) has been reported to have innate and adaptive immune capacity in local immune reactions. In vivo demonstration of inflammation of the ES in patients with MD is missing in the literature. We report the case of a 47-year-old female patient diagnosed with unilateral MD with genetic variants and cytokine markers indicating inflammation and vascular congestion of the ES. Endolymphatic hydrops in the right cochlea (grade 2) and vestibulum (grade 3) were detected using MRI. She carried heterozygous variants in MEFV (c.442G > C), IRF8 (c.1157G > T), ADA (c.445C > T), PEPD (c.151G > A), NBAS (c.4049T > C), CSF2RB (c.2222C > T), HPS6 (c.277G > T), IL2RB (c.1109C > T), IL12RB1 (c.1384G > T), IL17RC (c.260_271del GCAAGAGC TGGG), LIG1 (c.746G > A), RAG1 (c.650C > A), and SLX4 (c.1258G > C, c.5072A > G). In the serum, the levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage inflammatory protein 1α, and IL7 were significantly elevated, and the level of IL2Rα was reduced. Intratympanic administration of dexamethasone temporarily alleviated her hearing loss. Her vertigo was significantly relieved but remained slight after ES administration of corticosteroids."
21,Mutation research ,9539976; ,"DNA joining events are required for the completion of DNA replication, DNA excision repair and genetic recombination. Five DNA ligase activities, I-V, have been purified from mammalian cell extracts and three mammalian LIG genes, LIG1 LIG3 and LIG4, have been cloned. During DNA replication, the joining of Okazaki fragments by the LIG1 gene product appears to be mediated by an interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). This interaction may also occur during the completion of mismatch, nucleotide excision and base excision repair (BER). In addition, DNA ligase I participates in a second BER pathway that is carried out by a multiprotein complex in which DNA ligase I interacts directly with DNA polymerase beta. DNA ligase III alpha and DNA ligase III beta, which are generated by alternative splicing of the LIG3 gene, can be distinguished by their ability to bind to the DNA repair protein, XRCC1. The interaction between DNA ligase III alpha and XRCC1, which occurs through BRCT motifs in the C-termini of these polypeptides, implicates this isoform of DNA ligase III in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks and BER. DNA ligase II appears to be a proteolytic fragment of DNA ligase III alpha. The restricted expression of DNA ligase III beta suggests that this enzyme may function in the completion of meiotic recombination or in a postmeiosis DNA repair pathway. Complex formation between DNA ligase IV and the DNA repair protein XRCC4 involves the C-terminal region of DNA ligase IV, which contains two BRCT motifs. This interaction, which stimulates DNA joining activity, implies that DNA ligase IV functions in V(D)J recombination and non-homologous end-joining of DNA double-strand breaks. At the present time, it is not known whether DNA ligase V is derived from one of the known mammalian LIG genes or is the product of a novel gene."
22,Mutagenesis ,32914844; ,"DNA ligase I (LIG1) joins DNA strand breaks during DNA replication and repair transactions and contributes to genome integrity. The mutations (P529L, E566K, R641L and R771W) in LIG1 gene are described in patients with LIG1-deficiency syndrome that exhibit immunodeficiency. LIG1 senses 3'-DNA ends with a mismatch or oxidative DNA base inserted by a repair DNA polymerase. However, the ligation efficiency of the LIG1 variants for DNA polymerase-promoted mutagenesis products with 3'-DNA mismatches or 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) remains undefined. Here, we report that R641L and R771W fail in the ligation of nicked DNA with 3'-8-oxodG, leading to an accumulation of 5'-AMP-DNA intermediates in vitro. Moreover, we found that the presence of all possible 12 non-canonical base pairs variously impacts the ligation efficiency by P529L and R771W depending on the architecture at the DNA end, whereas E566K exhibits no activity against all substrates tested. Our results contribute to the understanding of the substrate specificity and mismatch discrimination of LIG1 for mutagenic repair intermediates and the effect of non-synonymous mutations on ligase fidelity."
23,Theranostics ,34373746; ,"Rationale: The human ligases (LIG1, LIG3 and LIG4) are essential for the maintenance of genomic integrity by catalysing the formation of phosphodiester bonds between adjacent 5'-phosphoryl and 3'-hydroxyl termini at single and double strand breaks in duplex DNA molecules generated either directly by DNA damage or during replication, recombination, and DNA repair. Whether LIG1, LIG3 and LIG4 can influence ovarian cancer pathogenesis and therapeutics is largely unknown. Methods: We investigated LIG1, LIG3 and LIG4 expression in clinical cohorts of epithelial ovarian cancers [protein level (n=525) and transcriptional level (n=1075)] and correlated to clinicopathological features and survival outcomes. Pre-clinically, platinum sensitivity was investigated in LIG1 depleted ovarian cancer cells. A small molecule inhibitor of LIG1 (L82) was tested for synthetic lethality application in XRCC1, BRCA2 or ATM deficient cancer cells. Results: LIG1 and LIG3 overexpression linked with aggressive phenotypes, platinum resistance and poor progression free survival (PFS). In contrast, LIG4 deficiency was associated with platinum resistance and worse PFS. In a multivariate analysis, LIG1 was independently associated with adverse outcome. In ovarian cancer cell lines, LIG1 depletion increased platinum cytotoxicity. L82 monotherapy was synthetically lethal in XRCC1 deficient ovarian cancer cells and 3D-spheroids. Increased cytotoxicity was linked with accumulation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), S-phase cell cycle arrest and increased apoptotic cells. L82 was also selectively toxic in BRCA2 deficient or ATM deficient cancer cells and 3D-spheroids. Conclusions: We provide evidence that LIG1 is an attractive target for personalization of ovarian cancer therapy."
24,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology ,21781197; ,"Base excision repair (BER) is an essential cellular defence mechanism against DNA damage, but it is poorly understood in plants. We used an assay that monitors repair of damaged bases and abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic, AP) sites in Arabidopsis to characterize post-excision events during plant BER. We found that Apurinic endonuclease-redox protein (ARP) is the major AP endonuclease activity in Arabidopsis cell extracts, and is required for AP incision during uracil BER in vitro. Mutant plants that are deficient in ARP grow normally but are hypersensitive to 5-fluorouracil, a compound that favours mis-incorporation of uracil into DNA. We also found that, after AP incision, the choice between single-nucleotide or long-patch DNA synthesis (SN- or LP-BER) is influenced by the 5' end of the repair gap. When the 5' end is blocked and not amenable to β-elimination, the SN sub-pathway is abrogated, and repair is accomplished through LP-BER only. Finally, we provide evidence that Arabidopsis DNA ligase I (LIG1) is required for both SN- and LP-BER. lig1 RNAi-silenced lines show very reduced uracil BER, and anti-LIG1 antibody abolishes repair in wild-type cell extracts. In contrast, knockout lig4(-/-) mutants exhibit normal BER and nick ligation levels. Our results suggest that a branched BER pathway completed by a member of the DNA ligase I family may be an ancient feature in eukaryotic species."
25,Cell reports ,24726358; ,"Of the three DNA ligases present in all vertebrates, DNA ligase I (Lig1) has been considered essential for ligating Okazaki fragments during DNA replication and thereby essential for cell viability. Here, we report the striking finding that a Lig1-null murine B cell line is viable. Surprisingly, the Lig1-null cells exhibit normal proliferation and normal immunoglobulin heavy chain class switch recombination and are not hypersensitive to a wide variety of DNA damaging agents. These findings demonstrate that Lig1 is not absolutely required for cellular DNA replication and repair and that either Lig3 or Lig4 can substitute for the role of Lig1 in joining Okazaki fragments. The establishment of a Lig1-null cell line will greatly facilitate the characterization of DNA ligase function in mammalian cells, but the finding alone profoundly reprioritizes the role of ligase I in DNA replication, repair, and recombination."
26,Current cancer drug targets ,27628597; ,"The human leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin like domains (LRIG) are evolutionary conserved family of single-pass transmembrane proteins. LRIG gene family includes three members, LRIG1 (formerly LIG1), LRIG2 and LRIG3, all of which are differentially expressed in human tissues and have long been proposed to be tumor suppressors. However, recently accumulated evidence on LRIG protein expression in human cancer appears to be inconsistent with this belief, as LRIG proteins have been found to be upregulated in certain tumors. Moreover, LRIG3 has been shown to act in an opposite manner to LRIG1 and LRIG1, in turn, has been shown to attenuate LRIG3 activity by its proteolytic degradation. These remarkable observations underline and reveal the previously unappreciated complexity of LRIG family dynamics. In the current review, the role of LRIG proteins in various human cancers is summarized and their differential regulation and expression is brought to light in order to understand how these proteins are involved in the genesis and progression of human cancers. Moreover, this is the first compilation that highlights the therapeutic potential of LRIG1 and suggests the same to be undertaken for LRIG2 and LRIG3. By virtue of their potential in prognosis of several cancer types, as well as their role as probable therapeutic proteins or in enhancing the receptiveness of the cancer cells to anti-tumor agents, it is strongly proposed that LRIG analysis should be undertaken and consequently be employed as a part of potential cancer treatment strategies."

Here, we identified genetic determinants for this epigenetic process and examined their biologic effects on gene regulation. A two-stage approach involving discovery and replication was used to assess the association between promoter hypermethylation of a 12-gene panel and common variation in 40 genes involved in carcinogen metabolism, regulation of methylation, and DNA damage response in members of the Lovelace Smokers Cohort (N = 1,434). Molecular validation of three identified variants was conducted using primary bronchial epithelial cells. Association of study-wide significance (P < 8.2 × 10(-5)) was identified for rs1641511, rs3730859, and rs1883264 in TP53, LIG1, and BIK, respectively. These single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were significantly associated with altered expression of the corresponding genes in primary bronchial epithelial cells. In addition, rs3730859 in LIG1 was also moderately associated with increased risk for lung cancer among Caucasian smokers. Together, our findings suggest that genetic variation in DNA replication and apoptosis pathways impacts the propensity for gene promoter hypermethylation in the aerodigestive tract of smokers. The incorporation of genetic biomarkers for gene promoter hypermethylation with clinical and somatic markers may improve risk assessment models for lung cancer."

Relative mRNA levels of uracil N-glycosylase (Ung), Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (Ape1), polymerase-beta (Polb), flap endonuclease (Fen1), and DNA ligase (Lig1) were measured in three parental Xiphophorus species (X. maculatus Jp 163 B, X. helleri Sarabia, and X. andersi andC) and in two interspecies F(1) hybrids, the Sp-helleri hybrid (X. maculatus Jp 163 BxX. helleri Sarabia) and the Sp-andersi hybrid (X. maculatus Jp 163 BxX. andersi) to identify genes that undergo changes in expression levels upon interspecies hybridization. Significant differences in gene expression were observed between parental animals and their respective F(1) hybrids in both interspecies crosses. Generally, marked increases in DNA repair gene mRNA levels were observed across all tissues in F(1) hybrid animals from the Sp-helleri cross compared to either X. maculatus or X. helleri parents. In contrast, the Sp-andersi F(1) hybrid animals generally exhibited decreased base-excision repair gene expression, although this trend was more specific to individual tissues than observed for Sp-helleri hybrids."

We hypothesized that polymorphisms of candidate genes involved in the DNA repair pathways may contribute to susceptibility to glioma. To address this possibility, we conducted a study on 373 Caucasian glioma cases and 365 cancer-free Caucasian controls to assess associations between glioma risk and 18 functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA repair genes. We evaluated potential gene-gene and gene-environment interactions using a multianalytic strategy combining logistic regression, multifactor dimensionality reduction and classification and regression tree approaches. In the single-locus analysis, six single-nucleotide polymorphisms [ERCC1 3' untranslated region (UTR), XRCC1 R399Q, APEX1 E148D, PARP1 A762V, MGMT F84L, and LIG1 5'UTR] showed a significant association with glioma risk. In the analysis of cumulative genetic risk of multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms, a significant gene-dosage effect was found for increased glioma risk with increasing numbers of adverse genotypes involving the aforementioned six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (P(trend) = 0.0004). Furthermore, the multifactor dimensionality reduction and classification and regression tree analyses identified MGMT F84L as the predominant risk factor for glioma and revealed strong interactions among ionizing radiation exposure, PARP1 A762V, MGMT F84L, and APEX1 E148D. Interestingly, the risk for glioma was dramatically increased in ionizing radiation exposure individuals who had the wild-type genotypes of MGMT F84L and PARP1 A762V (adjusted odds ratios, 5.95; 95% confidence intervals, 2.21-16.65). Taken together, these results suggest that polymorphisms in DNA repair genes may act individually or together to contribute to glioma risk."
32,Nature ,9242409; ,"V(D)J recombination generates diversity in the immune system through the lymphoid-specific assembly of multiple gene segments into functional immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes. The first step in V(D)J recombination is cleavage of DNA at recombination signal sequences. Cleavage produces a blunt DNA end on each signal sequence and a hairpin end on adjacent coding gene segments, and can be reproduced in vitro by using purified RAG and RAG2 proteins. The later steps involve processing and joining of the cleaved DNA ends, and until now have been studied only in cells. Here we reconstitute the complete V(D)J recombination reaction in a cell-free system. We find that the RAG proteins are not only involved in cleavage, but are also needed in the later steps for efficient joining of coding ends. Joining is largely directed by short pieces of identical sequence in the coding flanks, but addition of human DNA ligase I results in greater diversity. Coding junctions contain short deletions as well as additions complementary to a coding flank (P nucleotides). Addition of non-templated nucleotides into coding junctions is mediated by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase. The cell-free reaction can therefore reproduce the complete set of processing events that occur in cells."

Methyl-binding domain protein 4 (MBD4) is a member of the HhH-GPD DNA glycosylase superfamily, which has been well studied in mammals but not in plants. Our knowledge on the plant enzyme is limited to the activity of the Arabidopsis recombinant protein MBD4L in vitro. To start evaluating MBD4L in its biological context, we here characterized the structure, expression and effects of its gene, AtMBD4L. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that AtMBD4L belongs to one of the seven families of HhH-GPD DNA glycosylase genes existing in plants, and is unique on its family. Two AtMBD4L transcripts coding for active enzymes were detected in leaves and flowers. Transgenic plants expressing the AtMBD4L:GUS gene confined GUS activity to perivascular leaf tissues (usually adjacent to hydathodes), flowers (anthers at particular stages of development), and the apex of immature siliques. MBD4L-GFP fusion proteins showed nuclear localization in planta. Interestingly, overexpression of the full length MBD4L, but not a truncated enzyme lacking the DNA glycosylase domain, induced the BER gene LIG1 and enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress. These results suggest that endogenous MBD4L acts on particular tissues, is capable of activating BER, and may contribute to repair DNA damage caused by oxidative stress."
34,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden) ",12234026; ,"The LRIG1 gene (formerly LIG-1), recently cloned by us, displays structural similarities to the Drosophila Kek I gene. Kek I encodes a cell surface protein, Kekkon-1, which inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated signalling. We localized the LRIG1 gene to chromosome band 3p14.3, a region known to be deleted in various human cancers. In the present study LRIG1 gene expression was examined in different tumour cell lines and corresponding normal tissues by real-time RT-PCR. In many tumour cell lines, LRIG1 expression appeared absent or was down regulated compared to corresponding normal tissues. The results are consistent with LRIG1 being a tumour suppressor gene in humans. However, further studies are justified to elucidate the explicit role of LRIG1 as a negative regulator of oncogenesis."

The patients exhibited hypogammaglobulinemia, lymphopenia, increased proportions of circulating γδT cells, and erythrocyte macrocytosis. Clinical severity ranged from a mild antibody deficiency to a combined immunodeficiency requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Using engineered LIG1-deficient cell lines, we demonstrated chemical and radiation defects associated with the mutant alleles, which variably impaired the DNA repair pathway. We further showed that these LIG1 mutant alleles are amorphic or hypomorphic, and exhibited variably decreased enzymatic activities, which lead to premature release of unligated adenylated DNA. The variability of the LIG1 genotypes in the patients was consistent with that of their immunological and clinical phenotypes. These data suggest that different forms of autosomal recessive, partial DNA ligase 1 deficiency underlie an immunodeficiency of variable severity."

Using the Comet assay, we showed that 4-ABP (18.75-300μM) induces DNA damage in HepG2 cells after 24h. DNA damage signaling pathway-based PCR arrays were used to investigate expression changes in genes involved in DNA damage response. Results showed down-regulation of 16 DNA repair-related genes in 4-ABP-treated cells. Among them, the expression of selected six genes (UNG, LIG1, EXO1, XRCC2, PCNA, and FANCG) from different DNA repair pathways was decreased with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In parallel, using the miRNA array, we reported that the expression of 27 miRNAs in 4-ABP-treated cells was at least 3-fold higher than that in the control group. Of these differential 27 miRNAs, the most significant expression of miRNA-513a-5p and miRNA-630 was further validated by qRT-PCR, and was predicted to be implicated in the deregulation of FANCG and RAD18 genes, respectively, via bioinformatic analysis. Both FANCG and RAD18 proteins were found to be down-regulated in 4-ABP-treated cells. In addition, overexpression and knockdown of miRNA-513a-5p and miRNA-630 reduced and increased the expression of FANCG and RAD18 proteins, respectively. Based on the above results, we indicated that miRNA-513a-5p and miRNA-630 could play a role in the suppression of DNA repair genes, and eventually lead to DNA damage."

The first exon is untranslated, and utilises a GC dinucleotide instead of the canonical GT splice donor. The 5' flanking region lacks a TATA box and is highly GC-rich, as is characteristic of a 'housekeeping' gene. In common with the promoters of genes encoding other DNA replication enzymes, such as DNA polymerase alpha, the 5' flanking region of the DNA ligase I gene contains recognition elements for several transcription factors which may mediate increased expression in quiescent cells in response to growth factors."

The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular basis underlying the genotoxicity attributed to ErB and QY using the RT2 Profiler polymerase chain reaction array and by analyzing the expression profile of 84 genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA repair in HepG2 cells. ErB (70 mg/L) significantly decreased the expression of two genes ( FEN1 and REV1) related to DNA base repair. One gene ( LIG1) was downregulated and 20 genes related to ATR/ATM signaling ( ATR, RBBP8, RAD1, CHEK1, CHEK2, TOPB1), nucleotide excision repair ( ERCC1, XPA), base excision repair ( FEN1, MBD4), mismatch repair ( MLH1, MSH3, TP73), double strand break repair ( BLM), other DNA repair genes ( BRIP1, FANCA, GADD45A, REV1), and apoptosis ( BAX, PPP1R15A) were significantly increased after treatment with QY (20 mg/L).

40,The Journal of biological chemistry ,28751376; ,"Humans have three genes encoding DNA ligases with conserved structural features and activities, but they also have notable differences. The LIG3 gene encodes a ubiquitous isoform in all tissues (LIG3α) and a germ line-specific splicing isoform (LIG3β) that differs in the C-terminal domain. Both isoforms are found in the nucleus and the mitochondria. Here, we determined the kinetics and thermodynamics of single-stranded break ligation by LIG3α and LIG3β and compared this framework to that of LIG1, the nuclear replicative ligase. The kinetic parameters of the LIG3 isoforms are nearly identical under all tested conditions, indicating that the BRCA1 C terminal (BRCT) domain specific to LIG3α does not alter ligation kinetics. Although LIG3 is only 22% identical to LIG1 across their conserved domains, the two enzymes had very similar maximal ligation rates. Comparison of the rate and equilibrium constants for LIG3 and LIG1 nevertheless revealed important differences. The LIG3 isoforms were seven times more efficient than LIG1 at ligating nicked DNA under optimal conditions, mainly because of their lower Km value for the DNA substrate. This could explain why LIG3 is less prone to abortive ligation than LIG1. Surprisingly, the affinity of LIG3 for Mg2+ was ten times weaker than that of LIG1, suggesting that Mg2+ availability regulates DNA ligation in vivo, because Mg2+ levels are higher in the mitochondria than in the nucleus. The biochemical differences between the LIG3 isoforms and LIG1 identified here will guide the understanding of both unique and overlapping biological roles of these critical enzymes."

To characterize this karyotypic complexity at the molecular level, we used cDNA array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to analyze 29 CC cases and identified a number of over represented and deleted genes. The aCGH analysis revealed at least 17 recurrent amplicons and six common regions of deletions. These regions contain several known tumor-associated genes, such as those involved in transcription, apoptosis, cytoskeletal remodeling, ion-transport, drug metabolism, and immune response. Using the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) approach we demonstrated the presence of high-level amplifications at the 8q24.3, 11q22.2, and 20q13 regions in CC cell lines. To identify amplification-associated genes that correspond to focal amplicons, we examined one or more genes in each of the 17 amplicons by Affymetrix U133A expression arrays and semiquantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) in 31 CC tumors. This analysis exhibited frequent and robust upregulated expression in CC relative to normal cervix for genes EPHB2 (1p36), CDCA8 (1p34.3), AIM2 (1q22-23), RFC4, MUC4, and HRASLS (3q27-29), SKP2 (5p12-13), CENTD3 (5q31.3), PTK2, RECQL4 (8q24), MMP1 and MMP13 (11q22.2), AKT1 (14q32.3), ABCC3 (17q21-22), SMARCA4 (19p13.3) LIG1 (19q13.3), UBE2C (20q13.1), SMC1L1 (Xp11), KIF4A (Xq12), TMSNB (Xq22), and CSAG2 (Xq28).

The double replacement gene targeting procedure, to produce mice with subtle gene alterations, is based on the use of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase ( HPRT) minigenes in HPRT-deficient embryonic stem cells. Our standard HPRTminigene, under the control of the mouse phosphoglycerate kinase-1 gene promoter, was stably expressed at five of six target loci examined. At the remaining locus, DNA ligase I (Lig1), expression of this minigene was highly unstable. A different minigene, under the control of the mouse HPRT promoter and embedded in its natural CpG-rich island, overcame this position effect and was stably expressed when targeted to the identical site in the Lig1 locus. The promoter region of the stably expressed minigene remained unmethylated, while the promoter of the unstably expressed minigene rapidly became fully methylated. The difference in the stability of HPRT minigene expression at the same target locus can be explained in the context of the different lengths of their CpG-rich promoter regions with associated transcription factors and a resulting difference in their susceptibility to DNA methylation, rather than by differences in promoter strength."

Here, we take advantage of the powerful genetics of the DT40 chicken B-cell system to delineate the roles of LIG1 and LIG3 in alternative NHEJ. Our results expand the functions of LIG1 to alternative NHEJ and demonstrate a remarkable ability for LIG3 to backup DSB repair by NHEJ in addition to its essential function in the mitochondria.

The gene expression profiles of peripheral blood of patients with or without immune tolerance after liver transplantation were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differentially expressed genes were analyzed with a program in the R language, and the APE-1 gene was identified as a gene related to immune tolerance of liver transplantation. Four APE-1 shRNA vectors were constructed in parallel and verified as correct using plasmid sequencing, real-time PCR, and Western blotting. An APE-1 overexpression vector was similarly constructed and verified as correct. The STRING website predicted the protein-protein interaction network of APE-1. ELISA was used to detect the effects of APE-1 silencing and overexpression on inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-10, TNFα, and INF-γ in the control group, APE-1-silenced group, and APE-1 overexpression group. Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis in each group. Forty differentially expressed genes related to immune tolerance after liver transplantation were screened, and the highly expressed gene APE-1 was selected. The best APE-1 shRNA_1 vector and APE-1 overexpression vector were obtained. APE-1 is predicted to interact with ANP32A, FEN1, HMGB2, LIG1, MUTYH, NTHL1, OGG1, PCNA, POLB, SET, and other proteins. APE-1 silencing resulted in a significant increase in the expression of the inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-10, TNFα, and INF-γin L-02 cells. In contrast, the expression of APE-1 led to a significant decrease in the expression of inflammatory factors. APE-1 silencing significantly increased the rate of apoptosis of L-02 cells, and APE-1 overexpression resulted in a significant decrease in the rate of apoptosis of L-02 cells. In conclusion APE-1 affects the expression of inflammatory factors and apoptosis in L-02 cells, so it may be a key gene in immune tolerance of liver transplantation."
49,Progress in nucleic acid research and molecular biology ,11554294; ,"Three mammalian genes encoding DNA ligases--LIG1, LIG3, and LIG4--have been identified. Genetic, biochemical, and cell biology studies indicate that the products of each of these genes play a unique role in mammalian DNA metabolism. Interestingly, cell lines deficient in either DNA ligase I (46BR.1G1) or DNA ligase III (EM9) are sensitive to simple alkylating agents. One interpretation of these observations is that DNA ligases I and III participate in functionally distinct base excision repair (BER) subpathways. In support of this idea, extracts from both DNA ligase-deficient cell lines are defective in catalyzing BER in vitro and both DNA ligases interact with other BER proteins. DNA ligase I interacts directly with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and DNA polymerase beta (Pol beta), linking this enzyme with both short-patch and long-patch BER. In somatic cells, DNA ligase III alpha forms a stable complex with the DNA repair protein Xrcc1. Although Xrcc1 has no catalytic activity, it also interacts with Pol beta and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), linking DNA ligase III alpha with BER and single-strand break repair, respectively. Biochemical studies suggest that the majority of short-patch base excision repair events are completed by the DNA ligase III alpha/Xrcc1 complex. Although there is compelling evidence for the participation of PARP in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks, the role of PARP in BER has not been established."

The advantages of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the treatment of lung cancer are reflected. Berberine has been increasingly popular in colorectal cancer treatment, but little is known about its bioactivity against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, cDNA microarray, gene and protein expression, and NSCLC transplanted tumour growth were performed. Berberine suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro and inhibited NSCLC tumour growth in subcutaneously transplanted tumour lung tumour models, leading to prolonged survival of tumour-bearing mice. However, berberine did not induce the cleavage of Caspase 3 and PARP1, and could not induce apoptosis in all NSCLC cells. Moreover, 646 genes were differentially expressed upon berberine administration, which were involved in seven signal pathways, such as DNA replication. In cDNA microarray, berberine downregulated the expression of RRM1, RRM2, LIG1, POLE2 that involving DNA repair and replication. Our findings demonstrate that berberine inhibits NSCLC cells growth through repressing DNA repair and replication rather than through apoptosis. Berberine could be used as a promising therapeutic candidate for NSCLC patients."

BRG1 occurs at the promoters of genes such as CDK4, LIG1, and NEIL3, which are transcriptionally controlled by cell cycle progression and highly acetylated by EP300 in proliferating cells. As previously documented, in dividing cells BRG1 directly activates gene transcription by evicting EP300 modified nucleosomes from the promoters and, thereby, relaxing chromatin. However, the deficiency of BRG1 or EP300 activity for 48 h leads to cell growth arrest and to chromatin compaction, but also to the assembly of RB1/HDAC1/EZH2 complexes at the studied cell cycle-dependent gene promoters. Epigenetic changes include histone deacetylation and accumulation of H3K27me trimethylation, both known to repress transcription. Cell cycle arrest in G1 by inhibition of CDK4/6 phenocopies the effect of the long-term BRG1 inhibition on the chromatin structure. These results suggest that BRG1 may control gene transcription also by promoting expression of genes responsible for cell cycle progression in the studied breast cancer cells. In the current study, we show that BRG1 binding occurs at the promoters of functionally linked genes in proliferating breast cancer cells, revealing a new mechanism by which BRG1 defines gene transcription."

To investigate the potential genetic basis of adaptation to both highland and tropical deserts, we generated a chromosome-level genome sequence assembly of the wild castor accession WT05, with a genome size of 316 Mb, a scaffold N50 of 31.93 Mb, and a contig N50 of 8.96 Mb, respectively. Compared with cultivated castor and other Euphorbiaceae species, the wild castor exhibits positive selection and gene family expansion for genes involved in DNA repair, photosynthesis, and abiotic stress responses. Genetic variations associated with positive selection were identified in several key genes, such as LIG1, DDB2, and RECG1, involved in nucleotide excision repair. Moreover, a study of genomic diversity among wild and cultivated accessions revealed genomic regions containing selection signatures associated with the adaptation to extreme environments. The identification of the genes and alleles with selection signatures provides insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying the adaptation of wild castor to the high-altitude tropical desert and would facilitate direct improvement of modern castor varieties."

LIG-1 was expressed in basal cells of the epidermis and outer root sheath cells of hair follicles in mice. Interestingly, the LIG-1 expression was apparently down-regulated in the psoriatic lesions, suggesting that LIG-1 inversely correlates with proliferative ability of epidermal keratinocytes."

DNA ligase I mRNA is detected in all analysed cell systems, regardless of their proliferation state, including mature rat neurons. A significant increase in DNA ligase I mRNA level is observed when cells are induced to proliferate, in agreement with the raise of DNA joining activity found in the same cell systems. The increase parallels the start of DNA synthesis, but the messenger remains at high level beyond the end of the S phase and is detected also in the presence of aphidicolin. A decrease in DNA ligase I mRNA is observed in HL-60 and NIH-3T3 cells after differentiation. The high stability of DNA ligase I mRNA in both resting and proliferating human fibroblasts suggests a cell proliferation dependent rate of transcription. On the other hand the presence of a basal level of DNA ligase I in nondividing cells, strongly suggests an involvement of this enzyme in DNA repair. This conclusion is supported by a threefold increase in DNA ligase I observed 24 h after UV irradiation of human confluent primary fibroblasts."

Thio-DMA(V) exerts strong cellular toxicity, whereas its toxic modes of action are not fully understood. For the first time, this study characterises the impact of a long-term (21days) in vitro incubation of thio-DMA(V) on the expression of selected genes related to cell death, stress response, epigenetics and DNA repair. The observed upregulation of DNMT1 might be a cellular compensation to counterregulate the in a very recent study observed massive global DNA hypomethylation after chronic thio-DMA(V) incubation. Moreover, our data suggest that chronic exposure towards subcytotoxic, pico- to nanomolar concentrations of thio-DMA(V) causes a stress response in human urothelial cells. The upregulation of genes encoding for proteins of DNA repair (Apex1, Lig1, XRCC1, DDB2, XPG, ATR) as well as damage response (GADD45A, GADD45G, Trp53) indicate a potential genotoxic risk emanating from thio-DMA(V) after long-term incubation."

Complexes containing the Ku70/80 (""Ku"") and XRCC4/ligase IV (Lig4) core C-NHEJ factors are required, respectively, for sensing and joining DSBs. While XRCC4/Lig4 are absolutely required for joining RAG1/2 endonuclease (""RAG"")-initiated DSBs during V(D)J recombination in G1-phase progenitor lymphocytes, cycling cells deficient for XRCC4/Lig4 also can join chromosomal DSBs by alternative end-joining (A-EJ) pathways. Restriction of V(D)J recombination by XRCC4/Lig4-mediated joining has been attributed to RAG shepherding V(D)J DSBs exclusively into the C-NHEJ pathway. Here, we report that A-EJ of DSB ends generated by RAG1/2, Cas9:gRNA, and Zinc finger endonucleases in Lig4-deficient G1-arrested progenitor B cell lines is suppressed by Ku. Thus, while diverse DSBs remain largely as free broken ends in Lig4-deficient G1-arrested progenitor B cells, deletion of Ku70 increases DSB rejoining and translocation levels to those observed in Ku70-deficient counterparts. Correspondingly, while RAG-initiated V(D)J DSB joining is abrogated in Lig4-deficient G1-arrested progenitor B cell lines, joining of RAG-generated DSBs in Ku70-deficient and Ku70/Lig4 double-deficient lines occurs through a translocation-like A-EJ mechanism. Thus, in G1-arrested, Lig4-deficient progenitor B cells are functionally end-joining suppressed due to Ku-dependent blockage of A-EJ, potentially in association with G1-phase down-regulation of Lig1. Finally, we suggest that differential impacts of Ku deficiency versus Lig4 deficiency on V(D)J recombination, neuronal apoptosis, and embryonic development results from Ku-mediated inhibition of A-EJ in the G1 cell cycle phase in Lig4-deficient developing lymphocyte and neuronal cells."

Here, we investigated the function of PRPS from the single-celled green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in its response to DNA damage from gamma radiation or the alkylating agent LiCl. CrPRPS transcripts were upregulated in cells treated with these agents. We generated CrPRPS-overexpressing transgenic lines to study the function of CrPRPS. When grown in culture with LiCl or exposed to gamma radiation, the transgenic cells grew faster and had a greater survival rate than wild-type cells. CrPRPS overexpression enhanced expression of genes associated with DNA damage response, namely RAD51, RAD1, and LIG1. We observed, from transcriptome analysis, upregulation of genes that code for key enzymes in purine metabolism, namely ribonucleoside-diphosphate pyrophosphokinase subunit M1, adenylate kinase, and nucleoside-diphosphate kinase. We conclude that CrPRPS may affect DNA repair process via regulation of de novo nucleotide synthesis."

The study presents secondary analysis of our previous research. Three-day application of SOD and CAT in all forms of solution decreased the levels of CPD and 6-4PP boosted by UV irradiation. The mRNA expression level of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) system genes (XPA, XPC, ERCC1, ERCC2, ERCC3, LIG1) increased after application of immobilized and free enzymes. Increased by UV irradiation, p53 mRNA expression level normalized with the enzyme application.

One possible mechanism for the associations may be through DNA damage pathways. DNA Ligase I (LIG1) is a DNA repair gene involved in both the nucleotide excision repair (NER) and the base excision repair (BER) pathways. We examined the association of 4 LIG1 polymorphisms with lung and UADT cancers, and their potential interactions with smoking in a population-based case-control study in Los Angeles County. We performed genotyping using the SNPlex method from Applied Biosystems. Logistic regression analyses of 551 lung cancer cases, 489 UADT cancer cases and 948 controls showed the expected associations of tobacco smoking with lung and UADT cancers and new associations between the LIG1 haplotypes and these cancers. For lung cancer, when compared to the most common haplotype (rs20581-rs20580-rs20579-rs439132 = T-C-C-A), the adjusted odds ratio (OR) is 1.2 (95% confidence limits (CL) = 0.95, 1.5) for the CACA haplotype, 1.4 (1.0, 1.9) for the CATA haplotype and 1.8 (1.1, 2.8) for the CCCG haplotype, after controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education and tobacco smoking.

It is known that exposures to phthalate esters (PAEs), including Dibutyl phthalate (DBP), Mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), and Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), cause reactive oxygen species-induced DNA damage and oxidative stress. Here, we determined the mRNA levels of BER pathway-related genes (ogg1, nthl1, apex1, parp1, xrcc1, lig3, ung, pcna, polb, pold, fen1, and lig1), pro-apoptotic gene (bax), and apoptotic suppressor gene (bcl2) in different PAEs-exposed zebrafish larvae and HEK293T cells. Further investigations were performed to examine reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, developmental toxicity, and cell viability after PAEs exposure in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that PAEs exposure can induce developmental abnormalities in zebrafish larvae, and inhibit cell viability in HEK293T cells. Additionally, we found that PAEs exposure results in the accumulation of ROS and the inhibition of SOD activation in vivo and in vitro. Notably, the mRNA levels of BER pathway-related genes (OGG1, NTHL1, APEX1, XRCC1, UNG, POLB, POLD, FEN1) were significantly upregulated after DBP or MEHP exposure, whereas the mRNA levels of NTHL1, UNG, POLB, POLD, and FEN1 were significantly altered in DEHP-treated HEK293T cells. In zebrafish, the mRNA levels of ogg1, pcna, fen1 and lig1 genes were increased after DBP or DEHP exposure, whereas the mRNA levels of nthl1, apex1, parp1, lig3, pcna and polb were decreased after MEHP exposure, respectively. Thus, our findings indicated that PAEs exposure can induce developmental toxicity, cytotoxicity, and oxidative stress, as well as activate BER pathway in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that BER pathway might play critical roles in PAEs-induced oxidative stress through repairing oxidative DNA damage."

LRIG1 is a predicted integral membrane protein with a domain organization reminiscent of the Drosophila epidermal growth factor (EGF)-receptor antagonist Kekkon-1. We have searched for additional members of the human LRIG family and identified LRIG2 (). The LRIG2 gene was localized to chromosome 1p13 and had an open reading frame of 1065 amino acids. The LRIG2 protein was predicted to have the same domain organization as LRIG1 with a signal peptide, an extracellular part containing15 leucine-rich repeats and three immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. The LRIG2 amino acid sequence was 47% identical to human LRIG1 and mouse Lrig1 (also known as Lig-1). Northern blotting and RT-PCR revealed LRIG2 transcripts in all tissues analyzed. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed the most prominent RNA expression in skin, uterus, ovary, kidney, brain, small intestine, adrenal gland, and stomach. Immunoblotting of COS-7 cell lysates demonstrated that heterologously expressed human LRIG2 had an apparent molecular weight of 132 kDa under reducing gel-running conditions. N-glycosidase F treatment resulted in a reduction of the apparent molecular weight to 107 kDa, showing that LRIG2 was a glycoprotein carrying N-linked oligosaccharides. Cell surface biotinylation experiments and confocal fluorescence laser microscopy demonstrated expression of LRIG2 both at the cell surface and in the cytoplasm. LRIG2 was detected in tissue lysates from stomach, prostate, lung, and fetal brain by immunoblotting. In conclusion, LRIG2 was found to be a glycoprotein which was encoded by a gene on human chromosome 1p13 and its mRNA was present in all tissues analyzed."

Effective natural or synthesized compounds to prevent, treat, and/or inhibit ESCC relapse are desperately needed. The natural di-indole compound 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) is abundant in cruciferous vegetables and shows potent anti-tumor effects in multiple cancers. The synthesized Eflornithine (DFMO) is clinically used to treat African sleeping sickness. We demonstrated that the combination of DIM+DFMO could significantly suppress the ESCC growth in the in vivo study of three patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cases. Then, the corresponding underlying anticancer mechanisms were investigated via the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) on the proteome level. We found that the DNA Replication and Cell Cycle were the top-2 most significantly downregulated signaling pathways following the DIM+DFMO treatment. Correspondingly and interestingly, these two pathways were the top-2 upregulated ones in clinic ESCC tumors. Moreover, the involved differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including MCM2, MCM3, MCM5, MCM6, MCM7, CDK1, and LIG1 were all inversely downregulated by DIM+DFMO treatment. In the limited clinical study in two ESCC cases, the administration of DIM (250mg) +DFMO (500 mg) once daily showed favorable results, including alleviated swallowing difficulties, decreased blood tumor markers (CA19-9, CA15-3 and AFP), and no severe toxicity in at least one month progression free survival period. We concluded that DIM+DFMO is a promising therapeutic combination for ESCC treatment via the suppression of DNA Replication and Cell Cycle activities. However, these therapeutic effects should be verified in large cohort clinical trials with sufficient cases."

A specific peptide antibody, LRIG1-151, was raised in rabbits and used to study the LRIG1 protein. LRIG1 migrated in denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions as two species with apparent molecular weights of 143 kDa and 134 kDa, and as two fragments corresponding to an N-terminal 111-kDa species and a C-terminal 32-kDa species. Under non-reducing conditions, both apparent monomers and apparent higher molecular weight complexes were evident. Immunoblotting analysis of cell-surface-biotinylated lysates and confocal microscopy revealed that LRIG1 was localized to the cell surface in ZR-75 cells expressing endogenous LRIG1 and in COS-7 cells expressing a synthetic LRIG1-GFP fusion protein. Immunohistochemical analysis of normal human tissues showed staining for LRIG1 in epithelia in various organs, scattered neurons, and muscles. Immunoblotting demonstrated LRIG1 protein in tissue lysates from normal human prostate, mammary epithelial cells, ileum, stomach, lung, and cerebral cortex. These results demonstrate that LRIG1 is an integral cell-surface membrane protein that is expressed by specific cells in various human tissues and that its 143-kDa form might be cleaved into 111-kDa and 32-kDa fragments."
66,Mutagenesis ,34644377; ,"Reactive oxygen species formation and resultant oxidative damage to DNA are ubiquitous events in cells, the homeostasis of which can be dysregulated in a range of pathological conditions. Base excision repair (BER) is the primary repair mechanism for oxidative genomic DNA damage. One prevalent oxidised base modification, 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), is recognised by 8-oxoguanine glycosylase-1 (OGG1) initiating removal and repair via BER. Surprisingly, Ogg1 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mOgg1-/- MEFs) do not accumulate 8-oxoG in the genome to the extent expected. This suggests that there are backup repair mechanisms capable of repairing 8-oxoG in the absence of OGG1. In the current study, we identified components of NER (Ercc1, Ercc4, Ercc5), BER (Lig1, Tdg, Nthl1, Mpg, Mgmt, NEIL3), MMR (Mlh1, Msh2, Msh6) and DSB (Brip1, Rad51d, Prkdc) pathways that are transcriptionally elevated in mOgg1-/- MEFs. Interestingly, all three nucleotide excision repair genes identified: Ercc1 (2.5 ± 0.2-fold), Ercc4 (1.5 ± 0.1-fold) and Ercc5 (1.7 ± 0.2-fold) have incision activity. There was also a significant functional increase in NER activity (42.0 ± 7.9%) compared to WT MEFs. We also observed upregulation of both Neil3 mRNA (37.9 ± 1.6-fold) and protein in mOgg1-/- MEFs. This was associated with a 3.4 ± 0.4-fold increase in NEIL3 substrate sites in genomic DNA of cells treated with BSO, consistent with the ability of NEIL3 to remove 8-oxoG oxidation products from genomic DNA. In conclusion, we suggest that in Ogg1-null cells, upregulation of multiple DNA repair proteins including incision components of the NER pathway and Neil3 are important compensatory responses to prevent the accumulation of genomic 8-oxoG."

Here, we show highly and equally efficient gene knockout and knock-in at both transcriptionally active (HPRT1, KU80, LIG1, LIG3) and inactive (HB9) loci in these cells using high-capacity helper-dependent adenoviral vectors (HDAdVs). Without the necessity of introducing artificial DNA double-strand breaks, 7-81% of drug-resistant colonies were gene-targeted by accurate HR, which were not accompanied with additional ectopic integrations. Even at the motor neuron-specific HB9 locus, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene was accurately knocked in in 23-57% of drug-resistant colonies. In these clones, induced differentiation into the HB9-positive motor neuron correlated with EGFP expression. Furthermore, HDAdV infection had no detectable adverse effects on the undifferentiated state and pluripotency of hESCs and hiPSCs. These results suggest that HDAdV is one of the best methods for efficient and accurate gene targeting in hESCs and hiPSCs and might be especially useful for therapeutic applications."

Gene expression levels associated with aneuploidy provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying CIN. Based on the gene signature whose expression was consistent with functional aneuploidy, the CIN70 score was established. We observed an association of CIN70 score and survival in 519 HNSCC patients in the TCGA dataset; the 15% patients with the lowest CIN70 score showed better survival (p = 0.11), but association was statistically non-significant. This correlated with the expression of 39 proteins of the major repair complexes. A positive association with survival was observed for MSH2, XRCC1, MRE11A, BRCA1, BRCA2, LIG1, DNA2, POLD1, MCM2, RAD54B, claspin, a negative for ERCC1, all related with replication. We hypothesized that expression of these factors leads to protection of replication through efficient repair and determines survival and resistance to therapy. Protein expression differences in HNSCC cell lines did not correlate with cellular sensitivity after treatment. Rather, it was observed that the stability of the DNA replication fork determined resistance, which was dependent on the ATR/CHK1-mediated S-phase signaling cascade. This suggests that it is not the expression of individual DNA repair proteins that causes therapy resistance, but rather a balanced expression and coordinated activation of corresponding signaling cascades."

In silico analysis of public databases revealed a mouse Lrig2 mRNA, three LRIG homologs in the puffer fish Fugu rubripes, and one LRIG homolog in the ascidian tunicate Ciona intestinalis. The human and mouse LRIG polypeptides have the same predicted domain organization: a signal peptide, 15 tandem leucine-rich repeats with cysteine-rich N- and C-flanking domains, three immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular part--especially the IgC2.2 domain, the transmembrane domain, and the membrane-proximal part of the cytoplasmic tail--are the most conserved regions.

However, the causative genes of a few ICF patients remain unknown. We, herein, identified UHRF1 as a novel causative gene of one such patient with atypical symptoms. This patient is a compound heterozygote for two previously unreported mutations in UHRF1: c.886C > T (p.R296W) and c.1852C > T (p.R618X). The R618X mutation plausibly caused nonsense-mediated decay, while the R296W mutation changed the higher order structure of UHRF1, which is indispensable for the maintenance of CG methylation along with DNMT1. Genome-wide methylation analysis revealed that the patient had a centromeric/pericentromeric hypomethylation, which is the main ICF signature, but also had a distinctive hypomethylation pattern compared to patients with the other ICF syndrome subtypes. Structural and biochemical analyses revealed that the R296W mutation disrupted the protein conformation and strengthened the binding affinity of UHRF1 with its partner LIG1, and reduced ubiquitylation activity of UHRF1 towards its ubiquitylation substrates, histone H3 and PAF15. We confirmed that the R296W mutation causes hypomethylation at pericentromeric repeats by generating the HEK293 cell-lines that mimic the patient's UHRF1 molecular context. Since proper interactions of the UHRF1 with LIG1, PAF15, and histone H3 are essential for the maintenance of CG methylation, the mutation could disturb the maintenance process. Evidence for the importance of the UHRF1 conformation for CG methylation in humans is, herein, provided for the first time, and deepens our understanding of its role in regulation of CG methylation."

Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was conducted to detect HaeIII polymorphisms in exon 6 of the LIG1 gene in this popula-tion. This information was used to observe the effects of radiation in pa-tients with different genotypes in order to determine the genotypes as-sociated with radiosensitivity. The CC genotype and C allele frequency were significantly higher in the NSCLC group than in the control group (P = 0.012 and P = 0.023, respectively). The relative risk of experienc-ing NSCLC was 2.55 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-3.98] for CC homozygous patients and 0.87 (95%CI, 0.46-1.88) for AA homozygous patients.

74,ACS omega ,36119974; ,"The widespread accumulation of nanoplastics is a growing concern for the environmental and human health. However, studies on the mechanisms of nanoplastic-induced developmental toxicity are still limited. Here, we systematically investigated the potential biological roles of nanoplastic exposure in zebrafish during the early developmental stage. The zebrafish embryos were subjected to exposure to 100 nm polystyrene nanoplastics with different concentrations (0, 100, 200, and 400 mg/L). The results indicated that nanoplastic exposure could decrease the hatching and survival rates of zebrafish embryos. In addition, the developmental toxicity test indicated that nanoplastic exposure exhibits developmental toxicity via the inhibition of the heart rate and body length in zebrafish embryos. Besides, behavioral activity was also significantly suppressed after 96 h of nanoplastic exposure in zebrafish larvae. Further biochemical assays revealed that nanoplastic-induced activation of the oxidative stress responses, including reactive oxygen species accumulation and enhanced superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, might affect developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay demonstrated that the mRNA levels of the base excision repair (BER) pathway-related genes, including lig1, lig3, polb, parp1, pold, fen1, nthl1, apex, xrcc1, and ogg1, were altered in zebrafish embryos for 24 h after nanoplastic exposure, indicating that the activation of the BER pathway would be stimulated after nanoplastic exposure in zebrafish embryos. Therefore, our findings illustrated that nanoplastics could induce developmental toxicity through activation of the oxidative stress response and BER pathways in zebrafish."
75,Molecular biology and evolution ,7904041; ,"Fishes represent the stem vertebrate condition and have maintained several gene arrangements common to mammalian genomes throughout the 450 Myr of divergence from a common ancestor. One such syntenic arrangement includes the GPI-PEPD enzyme association on Xiphophorus linkage group IV and human chromosome 19. Previously we assigned the Xiphophorus homologue of the human ERCC2 gene to linkage group U5 in tight association with the CKM locus. CKM is also tightly linked to the ERCC2 locus on human chromosome 19, leading to speculation that human chromosome 19 may have arisen by fusion of two ancestral linkage groups which have been maintained in fishes. To investigate this hypothesis further, we isolated and sequenced Xiphophorus fish genomic regions exhibiting considerable sequence similarity to the human DNA ligase 1 amino acid sequence. Comparison of the fish DNA ligase sequence with those of other species suggests several modes of amino acid conservation in this gene. A 2.2-kb restriction fragment containing part of an X. maculatus DNA ligase 1 exon was used in backcross hybrid mapping with 12 enzyme or RFLP loci. Significant linkage was observed between the nucleoside phosphorylase (NP2) and the DNA ligase (LIG1) loci on Xiphophorus linkage group VI. This assignment suggests that the association of four DNA repair-related genes on human chromosome 19 may be the result of chance chromosomal rearrangements."

It lacks the sequence insert responsible for calcium dependence in the calcium-dependent NOS isoenzymes. NOS expression was strongly up-regulated in Physarum macroplasmodia during the 5-day starvation period needed to induce sporulation competence. Induction of both NOS and sporulation competence were inhibited by glucose, a growth signal and known repressor of sporulation, and by L-N6-(1-iminoethyl)-lysine (NIL), an inhibitor of inducible NOS. Sporulation, which is triggered after the starvation period by light exposure, was also prevented by 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo-[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), an inhibitor of NO-sensitive guanylate cyclase. In addition, also expression of lig1, a sporulation-specific gene, was strongly attenuated by NIL or ODQ. 8-Bromo-cGMP, added 2 h before the light exposure, restored the capacity of NIL-treated macroplasmodia to express lig1 and to sporulate. This indicates that the second messenger used for NO signaling in sporulation of Physarum is cGMP and links this signaling pathway to expression of lig1."
77,Cancers ,31614656; ,"BRG1, an active subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, enables the EP300-dependent transcription of proliferation and DNA repair genes from their E2F/CpG-driven promoters in breast cancer cells. In the current study, we show that BRG1-EP300 complexes are accompanied by poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1), which emerges as the functional component of the promoter-bound multiprotein units that are capable of controlling gene expression. This enzyme is co-distributed with BRG1 at highly acetylated promoters of genes such as CDK4, LIG1, or NEIL3, which are responsible for cancer cell growth and the removal of DNA damage. ADP-ribosylation is necessary to maintain active transcription, since it ensures an open chromatin structure that allows high acetylation and low histone density. PARP1-mediated modification of BRG1 and EP300 does not affect the association of enzymes with gene promoters; however, it does activate EP300, which acetylates nucleosomes, leading to their eviction by BRG1, thus allowing mRNA synthesis. Although PARP1 was found at BRG1 positive/H3K27ac negative promoters of highly expressed genes in a transformed breast cancer cell line, its transcriptional activity was limited to genes simultaneously controlled by BRG1 and EP300, indicating that the ADP-ribosylation of EP300 plays a dominant role in the regulation of BRG1-EP300-driven transcription. In conclusion, PARP1 directs the transcription of some proliferation and DNA repair genes in breast cancer cells by the ADP-ribosylation of EP300, thereby causing its activation and marking nucleosomes for displacement by BRG1. PARP1 in rapidly dividing cells facilitates the expression of genes that confer a cancer cell phenotype. Our study shows a new mechanism that links PARP1 with the removal of DNA damage in breast cancer cells via the regulation of BRG1-EP300-dependent transcription of genes involved in DNA repair pathways."

NER is a multistep process where in the end, subsequent to replication over the gap, the remaining nick is sealed by a DNA ligase. Lig1 has been implicated as the major DNA ligase in NER. Recently, Lig3 has been implicated as a component of a NER subpathway that operates in dividing cells, but which becomes particularly important in nondividing cells. Here, we use DT40 cells and powerful gene targeting approaches for generating DNA ligase mutants to examine the involvement and contribution of Lig1 and Lig3 in NER using cell survival measured by colony formation, and repair kinetics of CPD by immunofluorescence microscopy and immuno-slot-blotting. Our results demonstrate an impressive and previously undocumented potential of Lig3 to substitute for Lig1 in removing helix-distorting DNA lesions by NER in proliferating cells. We show for the first time in a clean genetic background a functional redundancy in NER between Lig1 and Lig3, which appears to be cell cycle independent and which is likely to contribute to the stability of vertebrate genomes."

80,Biochimie ,31756402; ,"Prostate cancer (PCa) progression is characterized by increased expression and transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (AR). In the advanced stages of prostate cancer, AR significantly upregulates the expression of genes involved in DNA repair. Upregulation of expression for base excision repair (BER) related genes is associated with poor patient survival. Thus, inhibition of the BER pathway may prove to be an effective therapy for prostate cancer. Using a high throughput BER capacity screening assay, we sought to identify BER inhibitors that can synergize with castration therapy. An FDA-approved drug library was screened to identify inhibitors of BER using a fluorescence-based assay suitable for HTS. A gel-based secondary assay confirmed the reduction of BER capacity by compounds identified in the primary screen. Five compounds were then selected for further testing in the independently derived, androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and LAPC4, and in the nonmalignant prostate derived cell lines PNT1A and RWPE1. Further analysis led to the identification of a lead compound, natamycin, as an effective inhibitor of key BER enzymes DNA polymerase β (pol β) and DNA Ligase I (LIG I). Natamycin significantly inhibited proliferation of PCa cells in an androgen depleted environment at 1 μM concentration, however, growth inhibition did not occur with nonmalignant prostate cell lines, suggesting that BER inhibition may improve efficacy of the castration therapies."
81,Cancer research ,8062276; ,"The frequent allelic loss of chromosome 19q in human gliomas suggests that 19q harbors a tumor suppressor gene that is integral to glioma tumorigenesis. Our initial deletion mapping of this gene localized the common region of deletion to the distal long arm, 19q13.2-13.4. To bracket the putative tumor suppressor gene further, we have studied this region in 55 gliomas, using loss of heterozygosity studies for 11 well mapped, highly informative microsatellite polymorphisms that cover this area: D19S178; BCL3; APOC2; ERCC1; DM; D19S112; HRC; D19S246; KLK; D19S180; and D19S254 (from centromeric to telomeric). Twenty astrocytic, oligodendroglial, and mixed gliomas had deletions affecting this region. Of nine partial deletions, two cases maintained heterozygosity at APOC2 while showing allelic loss at the more telomeric markers, ERCC1 and DM, while five cases maintained heterozygosity at HRC but lost the more centromeric markers, D19S112 and DM. Nine cases lost the entire D19S178 to D19S254 region. Three astrocytic gliomas, including one with an interstitial deletion, had terminal deletions of 19q13.4. The minimum area of overlap shared by the interstitial deletions is between APOC2 and HRC, including ERCC1, DM, and D19S112. These findings suggest that the glioma tumor suppressor gene maps to an approximately 8-cM/5-megabase region on 19q13.2-13.3 between the proximal marker APOC2 and the distal marker HRC. Among the DNA repair/DNA metabolism genes on chromosome 19q, ERCC1, LIG1, and perhaps ERCC2 are within the common area of deletion; XRCC1 is centromeric and is therefore excluded as a candidate."

As a consequence the ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein kinase (ATM) is constitutively phosphorylated at a basal level. Here, we use 46BR.1G1 cells as a model system to study the cell response to chronic replication-dependent DNA damage. Starting from a proteomic approach, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation level of factors controlling constitutive and alternative splicing is affected by the damage elicited by DNA ligase I deficiency. In particular, we show that SRSF1 is hyperphosphorylated in 46BR.1G1 cells compared to control fibroblasts. This hyperphosphorylation can be partially prevented by inhibiting ATM activity with caffeine. Notably, hyperphosphorylation of SRSF1 affects the subnuclear distribution of the protein and the alternative splicing pattern of target genes. We also unveil a modulation of SRSF1 phosphorylation after exposure of MRC-5V1 control fibroblasts to different exogenous sources of DNA damage. Altogether, our observations indicate that a relevant aspect of the cell response to DNA damage involves the post-translational regulation of splicing factor SRSF1 which is associated with a shift in the alternative splicing program of target genes to control cell survival or cell death."

Genetic basis of CVID remains largely unknown. However, in a minority of CVID patients, a number of distinct genetic defects affecting the normal processes of B cell maturation and differentiation into memory B cells have now been identified, resulting in markedly reduced serum levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and low immunoglobulin A (IgA) or immunoglobulin M (IgM), with impaired antibody responses, despite the presence of normal levels of B cells. Patients with CVID develop recurrent and chronic infections of respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, autoimmune diseases, lymphoproliferative complications, malignancies, and granulomatous disease. We report the case of a boy admitted to our unit for the first time at the age of three for reduced gamma globulin levels and a clinical history positive for two episodes of pneumonia. Our patient incompletely met ESID diagnostic criteria for CVID, but molecular genetic analysis, a NGS panel including 47 PID-associated genes was performed in the proband and in his parents, revealing the presence of a heterozygous nucleotide substitution in exon 4 (c.579C>A) of TNFRSF13B encoding TACI. This mutation has been described only in two CVID adult patients and in a child with selective IgA deficiency (sIgAD). We highlighted the same mutation in the asymptomatic mother and detected two extra heterozygous mutations of RIG1 and LIG1. We promptly started intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy with good tolerance. Despite the diagnosis of CVID remains clinical, in this case report we underline the importance of considering and planning genetic workup in all subjects with unclear diagnosis and of reporting new molecular diagnosis especially in case of rare mutations."

A strongly reduced ability of DNA ligase I to form a labeled enzyme-adenylate intermediate correlated with the genetic defect in 46BR cells.

85,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America ,27466406; ,"Allosteric communication is critical for protein function and cellular homeostasis, and it can be exploited as a strategy for drug design. However, unlike many protein-ligand interactions, the structural basis for the long-range communication that underlies allostery is not well understood. This lack of understanding is most evident in the case of classical allostery, in which a binding event in one protomer is sensed by a second symmetric protomer. A primary reason why study of interdomain signaling is challenging in oligomeric proteins is the difficulty in characterizing intermediate, singly bound species. Here, we use an NMR approach to isolate and characterize a singly ligated state (""lig1"") of a homodimeric enzyme that is otherwise obscured by rapid exchange with apo and saturated forms. Mixed labeled dimers were prepared that simultaneously permit full population of the lig1 state and isotopic labeling of either protomer. Direct visualization of peaks from lig1 yielded site-specific ligand-state multiplets that provide a convenient format for assessing mechanisms of intersubunit communication from a variety of NMR measurements. We demonstrate this approach on thymidylate synthase from Escherichia coli, a homodimeric enzyme known to be half-the-sites reactive. Resolving the dUMP1 state shows that active site communication occurs not upon the first dUMP binding, but upon the second. Surprisingly, for many sites, dUMP1 peaks are found beyond the limits set by apo and dUMP2 peaks, indicating that binding the first dUMP pushes the enzyme ensemble to further conformational extremes than the apo or saturated forms. The approach used here should be generally applicable to homodimers."

Genotyping was performed by mass-spectrometry with two multiplex sets of 27 and 31 SNPs. The study revealed different genetic composition of predisposition to cardiovascular disease continuum (CVDC) syntropy (patients with concomitant conditions: hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and type-II diabetes mellitus, N = 96) and to isolated myocardial infarction (without these conditions, N = 60). Only the KIAA1462 gene (rs3739998) showed associations with both CVDC syntropy (OR = 1.71; 95% CI 1.19-2.45; р = 0.003) and isolated infarction (OR = 1.58; 95% CI 1.05-2.40; р = 0.028).

87,DNA repair ,19523882; ,"The participation of the DNA ligase (hLigI) encoded by the human LIG1 gene in DNA replication and repair is mediated by an interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a homotrimeric DNA sliding clamp. Interestingly, the catalytic fragment of hLigI encircles a DNA nick forming a ring that is similar in size and shape to the PCNA ring. Here we show that the DNA binding domain (DBD) within the hLigI catalytic fragment interacts with both PCNA and the heterotrimeric cell-cycle checkpoint clamp, hRad9-hRad1-hHus1 (9-1-1). The DBD preferentially binds to trimeric PCNA and the hRad1 subunit of 9-1-1. Unlike the majority of PCNA interacting proteins, the DBD does not interact with the interdomain connector loop region of PCNA but instead appears to interact with regions adjacent to the intersubunit interfaces within the PCNA trimer. Notably, the DBD not only binds specifically to DNA nicks but also mediates the formation of DNA protein complexes with PCNA. Based on these results, we suggest that the interface between the DBD and PCNA acts as a pivot facilitating the transition of the hLigI catalytic region fragment from an extended conformation to a ring structure when it engages a DNA nick."

Despite the major clinical relevance of mutation-associated resistance in CML, the mechanisms underlying mutation acquisition in TKI-treated leukemic cells are not well understood. This work demonstrated de novo acquisition of mutations on isolated single-cell sorted CML clones growing in the presence of imatinib. The acquisition of mutations was associated with the significantly increased expression of the LIG1 and PARP1 genes involved in the error-prone alternative nonhomologous end-joining pathway, leading to genomic instability, and increased expression of the UNG, FEN and POLD3 genes involved in the base-excision repair (long patch) pathway, allowing point mutagenesis. This work showed in vitro and in vivo that de novo acquisition of resistance-associated mutations in oncogenes is the prevalent method of somatic mutation development in CML under TKIs treatment."

In addition, cancer cells can rapidly respond to conventional and targeted therapies by accumulating novel and often specific genetic lesions leading to acquired drug resistance and relapsing disease. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), however, diverse chromosomal aberrations often occur. In many cases, improper repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) is a major source for genomic abnormalities. Therefore, this study examined the repair of DNA DSBs by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) in CLL by performing plasmid-based repair assays in primary CLL cells and normal B cells, isolated from patients, as well as TALEN/Cas9-induced chromosomal deletions in the CLL cell line Mec1. It is demonstrated that DNA repair is aberrant in CLL cells, featuring perturbed DNA break structure preference with efficient joining of noncohesive ends and more deletions at repair junctions. In addition, increased microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) of DNA substrates was observed in CLL together with increased expression of MMEJ-specific repair factors. In summary, these data identify major differences in DNA repair efficiency between CLL cells and normal B cells isolated from patients.Implications: This study suggests inherently aberrant DNA DSB repair in the acquisition of subclonal genomic structural variations important for clonal evolution and treatment resistance in CLL.

We used gene targeting to introduce a point mutation into the mouse DNA ligase I gene that was present in a human cancer patient with immunodeficiency and a cellular accumulation of DNA replication intermediates. Mutant mice grew more slowly and showed hematopoietic defects at critical stages at which the demands for DNA replication were highest. In the spleen and thymus of mutant mice, the accumulation of a sub-G1, but nonapoptotic, population was observed that we believe may represent cells with single-strand DNA breaks. In mutant bone marrow, occasional DNA replication failure was observed. The level of genome instability was significantly elevated in the spleens of DNA ligase I mutant mice and, because we have found no evidence for any DNA repair defect associated with DNA ligase I deficiency, we believe that this may result directly from the accumulation of replication intermediates. Mutant mice showed an increased incidence of spontaneous cancers with a diverse range of epithelial tumors, particularly cutaneous adnexal tumors that are rare in mice. The origin of the tumors from generalized genome instability, rather than the inactivation of one key control gene, should make DNA ligase I mutant mice a useful model to investigate the relationship between genome instability and cancer in humans."

Segmental alterations are the strongest predictor of relapse and result from unbalanced translocations attributable to erroneous repair of chromosomal breaks. Although sequence analysis of affected genomic regions suggests that these errors arise by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), abnormalities in NHEJ have not been implicated in neuroblastoma pathogenesis. On this basis, the hypothesis that an error-prone mechanism of NHEJ is critical for neuroblastoma cell survival was tested. Plasmid-based DSB repair assays demonstrated efficient NHEJ activity in human neuroblastoma cells with repair products that were error-prone relative to nontransformed cells. Neuroblastoma cells derived from tumorigenic neuroblastic phenotypes had differential DNA repair protein expression patterns compared with nontumorigenic cells. Tumorigenic neuroblastoma cells were deficient in DNA ligase IV (Lig4) and Artemis (DCLRE1C), mediators of canonical NHEJ. Conversely, enzymes required for an error-prone alternative NHEJ pathway (alt-NHEJ), DNA Ligase IIIα (Lig3), DNA Ligase I (Lig1), and PARP1 protein were upregulated. Inhibition of Lig3 and Lig1 led to DSB accumulation and cell death, linking alt-NHEJ to cell survival in neuroblastoma.

Here we evaluated the combination of KPT-8602 with PARP inhibitors (PARPi) olaparib, veliparib and rucaparib in 22rv1 mCRPC cells. KPT-8602 synergized with PARPi (CI < 1) at pharmacologically relevant concentrations.

As a result, genomic instability is currently considered an enhancer of tumorigenesis rather than an obligatory event in this process. However, tumor heterogeneity presents a significant technical challenge for most cancer genomics studies performed at less than 100× mean resolution depth. To address the importance of genomic instability in prostate carcinogenesis and tumor progression, we performed ultrahigh depth exome sequencing of 124 DNA damage repair/response (repairome) genes in 63 tumors and matched normal tissue samples in African Americans and Caucasians. The average sequence depth was 712-fold for DNA isolated from normal tissue and 368-fold for FFPE tumors. We identified 671 somatic mutations in tumors from African Americans and 762 somatic mutations in tumors in Caucasians. The most frequently mutated DNA repairome genes were EXO1, ATR, POLQ, NEIL3, ERCC6, BRCA2, BRCA1, XPC, JAG1, RPA1, POLE, ATM, and LIG1 in African American men, and POLQ, NEIL3, POLB, BRCA2, EXO1, ERCC6, ATR, RBBP8, BRCA1, ATM, JAG1, XPC, and POLE in Caucasians. We found that 89% of tumors had at least one mutation in nucleotide excision repair pathway genes in African Americans, whereas >40% of tumors had mutations in base excision repair pathway genes in Caucasians. We further identified a marginal increase in mutation rate in tumors in African Americans with increasing age. Tumors in Caucasians did not show a correlation with age, but a progressive increase in the mutation rate was observed at higher Gleason scores. Our data reveal significant differences in the molecular signatures in the DNA repairome in prostate cancer between African Americans and Caucasians. These data also have substantial implications regarding the well-known health disparities in prostate cancer, such as the higher mortality in African Americans than Caucasians."
97,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry ,34801826; ,"The accumulation of epigenetic alterations is one of the major causes of tumorigenesis. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns cause genome instability and silencing of tumor suppressor genes in various types of tumors. Therefore, drugs that target DNA methylation-regulating factors have great potential for cancer therapy. Ubiquitin-like containing PHD and RING finger domain 1 (UHRF1) is an essential factor for DNA methylation maintenance. UHRF1 is overexpressed in various cancer cells and down-regulation of UHRF1 in these cells reactivates the expression of tumor suppressor genes, thus UHRF1 is a promising target for cancer therapy. We have previously shown that interaction between the tandem Tudor domain (TTD) of UHRF1 and DNA ligase 1 (LIG1) di/trimethylated on Lys126 plays a key role in the recruitment of UHRF1 to replication sites and replication-coupled DNA methylation maintenance. An arginine binding cavity (Arg-binding cavity) of the TTD is essential for LIG1 interaction, thus the development of inhibitors that target the Arg-binding cavity could potentially repress UHRF1 function in cancer cells. To develop such an inhibitor, we performed in silico screening using not only static but also dynamic metrics based on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, resulting in efficient identification of 5-amino-2,4-dimethylpyridine (5A-DMP) as a novel TTD-binding compound. Crystal structure of the TTD in complex with 5A-DMP revealed that the compound stably bound to the Arg-binding cavity of the TTD.

Stable transfection of wild type LigI, as in 7A3 cells, prevents DNA damage and ATM activation. Here we show that parental 46BR.1G1 and 7A3 cells differ in important features such as cell morphology, adhesion and migration. Comparison of gene expression profiles in the two cell lines detects Bio-Functional categories consistent with the morphological and migration properties of LigI deficient cells. Interestingly, ATM inhibition makes 46BR.1G1 more similar to 7A3 cells for what concerns morphology, adhesion and expression of cell-cell adhesion receptors.

Upon infection, the non-replicative cccDNA is converted from the incoming and de novo synthesized viral genomic relaxed circular (rc) DNA, presumably through employment of the host cell's DNA repair mechanisms in the nucleus. The conversion of rcDNA into cccDNA requires preparation of the extremities at the nick/gap regions of rcDNA for strand ligation. After screening 107 cellular DNA repair genes, we herein report that the cellular DNA ligase (LIG) 1 and 3 play a critical role in cccDNA formation. Ligase inhibitors or functional knock down/out of LIG1/3 significantly reduced cccDNA production in an in vitro cccDNA formation assay, and in cccDNA-producing cells without direct effect on viral core DNA replication. In addition, transcomplementation of LIG1/3 in the corresponding knock-out or knock-down cells was able to restore cccDNA formation. Furthermore, LIG4, a component in non-homologous end joining DNA repair apparatus, was found to be responsible for cccDNA formation from the viral double stranded linear (dsl) DNA, but not rcDNA. In conclusion, we demonstrate that hepadnaviruses utilize the whole spectrum of host DNA ligases for cccDNA formation, which sheds light on a coherent molecular pathway of cccDNA biosynthesis, as well as the development of novel antiviral strategies for treatment of hepatitis B."
