The manner in which circadian clock genes regulate drought stress responses in model plants has been well established, but comparatively little is known in crop species, such as soybean, a major global crop. This paper reports that the core clock components GmLHYs, the orthologues of CCA1/LHY in Arabidopsis, negatively control drought tolerance in soybean. The expressions of four GmLHYs were all induced by drought, and the quadruple mutants of GmLHYs demonstrated significantly improved drought tolerance. Transcriptome profiling suggested that the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway is regulated by GmLHYs to respond to drought tolerance. Genetic dissections showed that two homologous pairs of LHY1a and LHY1b redundantly control the drought response. Functional characterization of LHY1a and LHY1b in Arabidopsis and soybean further supported the notion that GmLHYs can maintain cellular homeostasis through the ABA signaling pathway under drought stress. This study improves our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms on soybean drought tolerance. Furthermore, the two homologues of LHY1a and LHY1b provide alternative targets for genome editing to rapidly generate mutant alleles in elite soybean cultivars to enhance their drought tolerance."

However, the regulatory mechanisms by which TAMs influence the progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain unclear. Here, we report that hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) acts as a novel oncoprotein in TNBC. We found that HLF was regulated by transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) that is secreted by TAMs. Then, HLF transactivated gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1) to promote the ferroptosis resistance, thus driving TNBC cell proliferation, metastasis and cisplatin resistance. Reciprocally, IL-6 produced by TNBC cells activated the JAK2/STAT3 axis to induce TGF-β1 secretion by TAMs, thus constituted a feed-forward circuit. The accuracy of TNBC patient prognosis could be improved by employing a combination of HLF and GGT1 values. Thus, our findings document that the interactive dialogue between TNBC cells and TAMs promotes sustained activation of HLF in tumor cells through the IL-6-TGF-β1 axis. Subsequently, HLF promotes the ferroptosis resistance in TNBC cells via GGT1 and ultimately facilitates the malignant tumor progression. Our study provides a potential target for the treatment of TNBC."

Here, we report the regulatory functions of two WRKY proteins in photomorphogenesis and PIF4 expression. PIF4 is a critical signaling hub in light, temperature, and hormonal signaling pathways. Either its expression or its accumulation peaks in the morning and afternoon. WRKY2 and WRKY10 form heterodimers and recognize their target site in the PIF4 promoter near the MYB element that is bound by CCA1 and LHY under red and blue light. WRKY2 and WRKY10 interact directly with CCA1/LHY to enhance their targeting but interact indirectly with SHB1. The two WRKY proteins also interact with phyB, and their interaction enhances the targeting of CCA1 and LHY to the PIF4 promoter. SHB1 associates with the WRKY2 and WRKY10 loci and enhances their expression in parallel with the PIF4 expression peaks. This forward regulatory loop further sustains the accumulation of the two WRKY proteins and the targeting of CCA1/LHY to the PIF4 locus. In summary, interactions of two WRKY proteins with CCA1/LHY and phyB maintain an optimal expression level of PIF4 toward noon and afternoon, which is essential to sketch the circadian pattern of PIF4 expression."

Starch accumulation is increased when carbon is in short supply, for example, in short photoperiods. Mobilization is paced to exhaust starch around dawn, as anticipated by the circadian clock. This diel pattern of turnover is largely robust against loss of day, dawn, dusk, or evening clock components. Here, we investigated diel starch turnover in the triple circadian clock mutant lhy cca1 elf3, which lacks the LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL and the CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) dawn components and the EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3) evening components of the circadian clock. The diel oscillations of transcripts for the remaining clock components and related genes like REVEILLE and PHYTOCHROME-INTERACING FACTOR family members exhibited attenuated amplitudes and altered peak time, weakened dawn dominance, and decreased robustness against changes in the external light-dark cycle. The triple mutant was unable to increase starch accumulation in short photoperiods. However, it was still able to pace starch mobilization to around dawn in different photoperiods and growth irradiances and to around 24 h after the previous dawn in T17 and T28 cycles. The triple mutant was able to slow down starch mobilization after a sudden low-light day or a sudden early dusk, although in the latter case it did not fully compensate for the lengthened night. Overall, there was a slight trend to less linear mobilization of starch. Thus, starch mobilization can be paced rather robustly to dawn despite a major disruption of the transcriptional clock. It is proposed that temporal information can be delivered from clock components or a semi-autonomous oscillator."

Although the function of VIN3 has been extensively studied, how VIN3 expression itself is upregulated by long-term cold is not well understood. In this study, we identified a vernalization-responsive cis-element in the VIN3 promoter, VREVIN3, composed of a G-box and an evening element (EE). Mutations in either the G-box or the EE prevented VIN3 expression from being fully induced upon vernalization, leading to defects in the vernalization response. We determined that the core clock proteins CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and LATE-ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) associate with the EE of VREVIN3, both in vitro and in vivo. In a cca1 lhy double mutant background harboring a functional FRIGIDA allele, long-term cold-mediated VIN3 induction and acceleration of flowering were impaired, especially under mild cold conditions such as at 12°C. During prolonged cold exposure, oscillations of CCA1/LHY transcripts were altered, while CCA1 abundance increased at dusk, coinciding with the diurnal peak of VIN3 transcripts. We propose that modulation of the clock proteins CCA1 and LHY participates in the systems involved in sensing long-term cold for the activation of VIN3 transcription."

Here we demonstrate that, as shown previously for CCA1, inactivation of LHY shortens the period of circadian rhythms in gene expression and leaf movements. By constructing lhy cca1-1 double mutants, we show that LHY and CCA1 are partially redundant and essential for the maintenance of circadian rhythms in constant light. Under light/dark cycles the lhy cca1-1 plants show dramatically earlier phases of expression of GI and TOC1, genes associated with the generation of circadian rhythms and the promotion of LHY and CCA1 expression. We conclude that LHY and CCA1 appear to be negative regulatory elements required for central oscillator function."

BES1 repressed expression of CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) at night by binding to their promoters, together with TOPLESS (TPL). The repression of CCA1 and LHY by BR treatment, which occurred during the night, was compromised in bes1-ko and tpl-8 mutants. Consistently, long-term treatment with BR shortened the circadian period, and BR-induced rhythmic shortening was impaired in bes1-ko and tpl-8 single mutants and in the cca1-1lhy-21 double mutant. Overall, BR signaling is conveyed to the circadian oscillator via the BES1/TPL-CCA1/LHY module, contributing to gating diurnal BR responses in plants."

In soybean, a major legume crop, flowering time variation is well characterized within domesticated germplasm and is critical for modern production, but its importance during domestication is unclear. Here, we identify sequential contributions of two homeologous pseudo-response-regulator genes, Tof12 and Tof11, to ancient flowering time adaptation, and demonstrate that they act via LHY homologs to promote expression of the legume-specific E1 gene and delay flowering under long photoperiods. We show that Tof12-dependent acceleration of maturity accompanied a reduction in dormancy and seed dispersal during soybean domestication, possibly predisposing the incipient crop to latitudinal expansion. Better understanding of this early phase of crop evolution will help to identify functional variation lost during domestication and exploit its potential for future crop improvement."

Here we investigate the epistatic interaction between DE-ETIOLATED 1 (DET1), a negative regulator of light-regulated gene expression, and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY), one of the core components of the circadian oscillator. The daily onset of LHY gene expression was advanced by approximately 4 h in det1-1 mutant plants, suggesting that the wild-type DET1 protein might function to repress its transcription during the subjective night. lhy-1 det1-1 double mutants exhibited arrhythmic expression of the CAB gene in constant light, similar to the lhy-1 mutant parent. However, additive effects of the lhy-1 and det1-1 mutations on CAB2 expression patterns were revealed under diurnal light-dark cycles. Since the lhy-1 mutation causes aberrant, constitutive transcription of LHY from a constitutive viral promoter, this observation indicated that effects of DET1 were not mediated through the regulation of LHY transcription. Furthermore, the light-driven, rhythmic accumulation of the LHY protein in the lhy-1 mutant was altered by the det1-1 mutation, suggesting that DET1 might regulate LHY expression at the post-transcriptional level. In vitro protein degradation assays demonstrated that the LHY protein is turned over rapidly through the proteasome pathway. Similar degradation was observed whether plant tissue was harvested during the light or dark portion of the diurnal cycle, but the process was significantly accelerated in det1-1 mutant extracts. These results indicate that the wild-type DET1 protein acts to inhibit the proteolytic turnover of the LHY protein, and suggest a mechanism for the period-shortening effect of the det1-1 mutation. These findings add to recent evidence suggesting a role for DET1 in a ubiquitination pathway and identify a substrate for DET1-regulated protein turn-over."

This paper reports the genome-wide analysis of its binding targets and reveals a role in the control of abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and downstream responses. LHY directly repressed expression of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase enzymes, which catalyse the rate-limiting step of ABA biosynthesis. This suggested a mechanism for the circadian control of ABA accumulation in wild-type plants. Consistent with this hypothesis, ABA accumulated rhythmically in wild-type plants, peaking in the evening. LHY-overexpressing plants had reduced levels of ABA under drought stress, whereas loss-of-function mutants exhibited an altered rhythm of ABA accumulation. LHY also bound the promoter of multiple components of ABA signalling pathways, suggesting that it may also act to regulate responses downstream of the hormone. LHY promoted expression of ABA-responsive genes responsible for increased tolerance to drought and osmotic stress but alleviated the inhibitory effect of ABA on seed germination and plant growth. This study reveals a complex interaction between the circadian clock and ABA pathways, which is likely to make an important contribution to plant performance under drought and osmotic stress conditions."

These oscillations correlated with high amplitude changes in LHY protein levels, caused by light-induced translation of the LHY transcript. Increases in LHY protein levels were also observed in light-grown wild-type plants, when light signals coincided with the circadian-regulated peak of LHY transcription at dawn. Unexpectedly, translational induction coincided with acute downregulation of LHY transcript levels. We suggest that the simultaneous translational induction and transcriptional repression of LHY expression play a role to narrow the peak of LHY protein synthesis at dawn and increase the robustness and accuracy of circadian oscillations. Strong phase shifting responses to light signals were observed in plants lacking function of LHY, CCA1 or both, suggesting that light-regulated expression of these proteins does not mediate entrainment of the clock to light-dark cycles."

Here we show that these genes are expressed at constant, basal levels in dark-grown seedlings. Transfer to constant red light (Rc) rapidly induces a biphasic pattern of CCA1 and LHY expression, and a reciprocal TOC1 expression pattern over the first 24 h, consistent with initial induction of this synchronous oscillation by the light signal. We have used this assay with wild-type and mutant seedlings to examine the role of these oscillator components, and to determine the function of ELF3 and ELF4 in their light-regulated expression. The data show that whereas TOC1 is necessary for light-induced CCA1/LHY expression, the combined absence of CCA1 and LHY has little effect on the pattern of light-induced TOC1 expression, indicating that the negative regulatory arm of the proposed oscillator is not fully functional during initial seedling de-etiolation. By contrast, ELF4 is necessary for light-induced expression of both CCA1 and LHY, and conversely, CCA1 and LHY act negatively on light-induced ELF4 expression. Together with the observation that the temporal light-induced expression profile of ELF4 is counter-phased to that of CCA1 and LHY and parallels that of TOC1, these data are consistent with a previously unrecognized negative-feedback loop formed by CCA1/LHY and ELF4 in a manner analogous to the proposed CCA1/LHY/TOC1 oscillator. ELF3 is also necessary for light-induced CCA1/LHY expression, but it is neither light-induced nor clock-regulated during de-etiolation. Taken together, the data suggest (a) that ELF3, ELF4, and TOC1 all function in the primary, phytochrome-mediated light-input pathway to the circadian oscillator in Arabidopsis; and (b) that this oscillator consists of two or more interlocking transcriptional feedback loops that may be differentially operative during initial light induction and under steady-state circadian conditions in entrained green plants."

Our results suggest that a defect in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling delayed flowering independent of the FLC expression level, at least in plants with the lhy;cca1 mutation grown under LL. The dwf4/pta5 mutation did not enhance the late-flowering phenotype of plants overexpressing SVP under LL, suggesting that SVP and BR function in a common pathway that controls flowering time. Our results suggest that the lhy;cca1 mutant exhibits delayed flowering due to both the BR signaling-dependent and -independent pathways under LL."

We characterized growth and light- and dark-adapted photosynthetic rates (Ac ) throughout a 24 h day in empty vector-transformed (EV), irLHY, and irTOC1 plants in the field, and in NaPhyA- and NaPhyB1-silenced plants in the glasshouse. The growth rates of irLHY plants were lower than those of EV plants in the field. While irLHY plants reduced Ac earlier at dusk, no differences between irLHY and EV plants were observed at dawn in the field. irLHY, but not EV plants, responded to light in the night by rapidly increasing Ac . Under controlled conditions, EV plants rapidly increased Ac in the day compared to dark-adapted plants at night; irLHY plants lost these time-dependent responses. The role of NaLHY in gating photosynthesis is independent of the light-dependent reactions and red light perceived by NaPhyA, but not NaPhyB1. In summary, the circadian clock allows plants not to respond photosynthetically to light at night by anticipating and gating red light-mediated in native tobacco."

LHY and CCA1 accelerated flowering in LL by promoting FT expression through a genetic pathway that appears to be independent of the canonical photoperiodic pathway involving GI and CO proteins. A genetic screen revealed that the late-flowering phenotype of the lhy;cca1 double mutant under LL was suppressed through mutations in SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), a MADS box transcription factor. Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated an interaction between SVP and FLOWERING LOCUS C, and genetic analysis indicated that these two proteins act as partially redundant repressors of flowering time.

We characterized, in wild type plants, temperature-associated isoform switching and expression patterns for SF transcripts from a high-resolution temperature and time series RNA-seq experiment. In addition, we employed quantitative RT-PCR of SF mutant plants to explore the role of the SFs in cooling-associated AS of LHY. We show that the splicing and expression of several SFs responds sufficiently, rapidly, and sensitively to temperature changes to contribute to the splicing of the 5'UTR of LHY. Moreover, the choice of splice site in LHY was altered in some SF mutants. The splicing of the 5'UTR region of LHY has characteristics of a molecular thermostat, where the ratio of transcript isoforms is sensitive to temperature changes as modest as 2 °C and is scalable over a wide dynamic range of temperature. Our work provides novel insight into SF-mediated coupling of the perception of temperature to post-transcriptional regulation of the clock."

The similar circadian phenotypes of lines overexpressing either CCA1 or LHY have suggested that the functions of these two transcription factors are largely overlapping. cca1-1 plants, which lack CCA1 protein, show a short-period phenotype for the expression of several genes when assayed under constant light conditions. This suggests that LHY function is able to only partially compensate for the lack of CCA1 protein, resulting in a clock with a faster pace in cca1-1 plants. We have obtained plants lacking CCA1 and with LHY function strongly reduced, cca1-1 lhy-R, and show that these plants are unable to maintain sustained oscillations in both constant light and constant darkness. However, these plants exhibit some circadian function in light/dark cycles, showing that the Arabidopsis circadian clock is not entirely dependent on CCA1 and LHY activities."

Double mutations in LHY and CCA1 (lhy;cca1) accelerated flowering under short days, mainly by the GI-CO dependent pathway. In contrast, lhy;cca1 showed delayed flowering under continuous light (LL), probably due to the GI-CO independent pathway. This late-flowering phenotype was suppressed by svp, flc, and elf3. However, how SVP, FLC, and ELF3 mediate LHY/CCA1 and flowering time is not fully understood. We found that lhy;cca1 exhibited short hypocotyls and petioles under LL, but the molecular mechanism for these effects has not been elucidated. To address these questions, we performed a screen for mutations that suppress either or both of the lhy;cca1 phenotypes under LL, using two different approaches. We identified two novel mutations, a dominant (del1) and a recessive (phyB-2511) allele of phyB. The flowering times of single mutants of three phyB alleles, hy3-1, del1, and phyB-2511, are almost the same and earlier than those of wild-type plants. A similar level of acceleration of flowering time was observed in all three phyB mutants tested when combined with the late-flowering mutations co-2 and SVPox. However, the effect of phyB-2511 on lhy;cca1 was different from those by hy3-1 or del1. svp-3 did not strongly enhance the early-flowering phenotypes of phyB-2511 or del1. These results suggest that light signaling via PhyB may affect factors downstream of the clock proteins, controlling flowering time and organ elongation. phyB mutations with different levels of effects on lhy;cca1-dependent late flowering would be useful to determine a specific role for PHYB in the flowering pathway controlled by lhy;cca1 under LL."

Meanwhile, MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq further revealed the potential function m6A modification in regulating apoptosis. More importantly, KEGG pathway and Gene ontology (GO) analyses further elucidated that the differentially m6A-modified genes were aggregated in apoptosis-related pathways. Mechanistic analysis indicated that knockdown of FTO facilitated CoCl2-induced apoptosis via caspase activation and G1/S cell cycle arrest. Nevertheless, overexpression of FTO partly attenuated the increased apoptosis following CoCl2 exposure. More notably, we observed that FTO regulated apoptosis in an m6A-dependent manner. Therefore, our findings reveal that CoCl2 induced ROS affected the m6A modification of apoptosis-related genes by decreasing the expression of FTO, thereby resulting in the activation of apoptosis.

Under different light regimes, Lhcb and PvLHY exhibit a clear circadian pattern of expression. Moreover, the rhythm of Lhcb genes appears to be tightly coupled to that of PvLHY with the latter having a slightly earlier phase. This supports the idea that the oscillating capacity of PvLHY may be one of the causes of the rhythmic expression of Lhcb genes in bean. In addition to their circadian regulation, Lhcb and PvLHY are induced by light with similar and relatively slow induction kinetics. Moreover, this light induction is gated by the circadian oscillator: minimal responses occur at times around peaks of the pre-existing rhythm, while maximal ones occur at troughs of the pre-existing rhythm. This pattern of gating is opposite to that observed in Arabidopsis. The failure to block the light induction pathways at pre-existing troughs appears to have a detrimental effect to the subsequent circadian rhythmicity.

CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1)/LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1) reciprocally repress genes encoding each other and are critical for the generation of circadian rhythms controlling many clock outputs. A precise regulation of transcriptional events is, therefore, essential for proper circadian function. Here, we investigated histone 3 (H3) tail modifications of CCA1, LHY and TOC1 under various conditions. We found specific association of only H3K4Me3 and H3K9/14Ac with the translational start site of these three genes. These H3 marks were enriched at circadian time points of their increased transcription at different photoperiods and under free-running conditions, suggesting circadian regulation of H3 modifications. Analysis of clock-compromised CCA1-overexpressing lines provided evidence that light/dark photoperiods signal the establishment of these chromatin changes which are gated by the clock."

The transgenic plants transformed with the promoter including the 5'UTR had altered circadian regulation resulting in elongated hypocotyls, a bushy appearance and delayed flowering. In contrast, the transgenic plants transformed with the promoter without the 5'UTR showed earlier flowering than the wild type. Changes in CCA1, LHY and TOC1 gene expression were investigated under light-dark (L:D) fluctuations, continuous darkness (D:D) and continuous light (L:L). The circadian expression of CCA1 was altered in both sets of transgenic plants, being repressed in the plants transformed with the 1.01-kb fragment and constitutively overexpressed in those transformed with the 1.3-kb fragment. Under L:D conditions, regulation of LHY and TOC1 expression was separated from CCA1 regulation in both sets of transgenic plants, with intact rhythmic expression of both LHY and TOC1. Under D:D conditions, the rhythmic expression of LHY and TOC1 was lost in the 1.3 plants but retained with some erratic pattern under L:L conditions. In the 1.01 plants, under both D:D and L:L conditions the rhythmic expression was retained. These results indicate separate light-induced signal-transmission pathways for LHY and CCA1."

Nevertheless, the genetic linkages between the major clock-associated TOC1, CCA1 and LHY genes and the canonical CO-FT flowering pathway are less clear. By employing a set of mutants including an extremely early flowering toc1 cca1 lhy triple mutant, here we showed that CCA1 and LHY act redundantly as negative regulators of the photoperiodic flowering pathway. The partly redundant CCA1/LHY functions are largely, but not absolutely, dependent on the upstream TOC1 gene that serves as an activator. The results of examination with reference to the expression profiles of CO and FT in the mutants indicated that this clock circuitry is indeed linked to the CO-FT output pathway, if not exclusively. For this linkage, the phase control of certain flowering-associated genes, GI, CDF1 and FKF1, appears to be crucial. Furthermore, the genetic linkage between TOC1 and CCA1/LHY is compatible with the negative and positive feedback loop, which is currently believed to be a core of the circadian clock. The results of this study suggested that the circadian clock might open an exit for a photoperiodic output pathway during the daytime. In the context of the current clock model, these results will be discussed in connection with the previous finding that the same clock might open an exit for the early photomorphogenic output pathway during the night-time."

This timing of scent emission is thought to be evolutionarily beneficial to maximize resource efficiency while attracting only useful pollinators. Temporal regulation of scent emission is tied to the activity of the specific metabolic pathways responsible for scent production. Although floral volatile profiling in various plants indicated a contribution by the circadian clock, the mechanisms by which the circadian clock regulates timing of floral scent emission remained elusive. Recent studies using two species in the Solanaceae family provided initial insight into molecular clock regulation of scent emission timing. In Petunia hybrida, the floral volatile benzenoid/phenylpropanoid (FVBP) pathway is the major metabolic pathway that produces floral volatiles. Three MYB-type transcription factors, ODORANT 1 (ODO1), EMISSION OF BENZENOIDS I (EOBI), and EOBII, all of which show diurnal rhythms in mRNA expression, act as positive regulators for several enzyme genes in the FVBP pathway. Recently, in P. hybrida and Nicotiana attenuata, homologs of the Arabidopsis clock gene LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) have been shown to have a similar role in the circadian clock in these plants, and to also determine the timing of scent emission. In addition, in P. hybrida, PhLHY directly represses ODO1 and several enzyme genes in the FVBP pathway during the morning as an important negative regulator of scent emission. These findings facilitate our understanding of the relationship between a molecular timekeeper and the timing of scent emission, which may influence reproductive success."

We describe here the role of PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR7 (PRR7) and PRR9 in temperature compensation. The Arabidopsis thaliana circadian oscillator comprises a series of interlocking feedback loops, and PRR7 and PRR9 function in the morning loop. The prr7 prr9 double mutant displays a unique phenotype that has not been observed before in other Arabidopsis clock mutants. In the prr7 prr9 mutant, the effects of temperature are overcompensated, apparently due to hyperactivation of the transcription factors CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY). Inactivation of CCA1 and LHY fully suppresses the overcompensation defects of prr7 prr9 mutants and rescues their long period phenotype. Overcompensation in prr7 prr9 mutants does not rely on FLOWERING LOCUS C, a previously identified gene required for temperature compensation. Together, our results reveal a role of PRR7 and PRR9 in regulating CCA1 and LHY activities in response to ambient temperature."

Forty genes exhibiting nonsynonymous substitutions between G. max and G. soja were catalogued. In addition, 22 genes were found to co-localize with QTLs for six traits including flowering time, first flower, pod maturity, beginning of pod, reproductive period, and seed filling period. Among the genes overlapping the QTL regions, two LHY/CCA1 genes, GI and SFR6 contained amino acid changes. The recently duplicated sequence regions of the soybean genome were used as additional criteria for the speculation of the putative function of the homologs. Two duplicated regions showed redundancy of both flowering-related genes and QTLs. ID 12398025, which contains the homeologous regions between chr 7 and chr 16, was redundant for the LHY/CCA1 and SPA1 homologs and the QTLs. Retaining of the CRY1 gene and the pod maturity QTLs were observed in the duplicated region of ID 23546507 on chr 4 and chr 6. Functional DNA variation of the LHY/CCA1 gene (Glyma07g05410) was present in a counterpart of the duplicated region on chr 7, while the gene (Glyma16g01980) present in the other portion of the duplicated region on chr 16 did not show a functional sequence change.

Their clock-regulating functions are believed to be partially redundant, and mutation of either gene leads to shortened periods of the circadian cycle. Our recent study has demonstrated that CCA1 promotes plant resistance to the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) through modulation of indole glucosinolate biosynthesis, but the role of LHY remains to be elucidated. Here we showed that, similar to cca1-11, single mutant lhy-21 became more susceptible to aphid infestation. Damage to the cca1-11 lhy-21 double mutant by aphids was most pronounced, indicating that the defensive roles of CCA1 and LHY were not entirely redundant. Also, the cyclic expression pattern of key indole glucosinolate biosynthetic genes was considerably disturbed in both single mutants and this was more severe in the double mutant. Apparently, both CCA1 and LHY were necessary for circadian-regulated indole glucosinolate biosynthesis.

Atmospheric-pressure non-equilibrium plasma is an emerging technique for fast pathogen aerosol abatement. In this work, in-duct disinfectors based on grating-like dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasmas with varied electrode arrangements were established and evaluated. The highest airborne bacterial inactivation efficiency was achieved by 'vertical' structure, namely when aerosol was in direct contact with the discharge region, at a given discharge power. For all reactors, the efficiency was linearly correlated to the discharge power (R2 =0.929-0.994). The effects of environmental factors were examined. Decreased airflow rates boosted the efficiency, which reached 99.8% at the velocity of 0.5 m/s with an aerosol residence time of ~3.6 ms. Increasing humidity (relative humidity (RH)=20-60%) contributed to inactivation efficacy, while high humidity (RH=70%-90%) led to a saturated efficiency, possibly due to the disruption of discharge uniformity. As suggested by the plasma effluent treatment and scavenger experiments, gaseous short-lived chemical species or charged particles were concluded as the major agents accounting for bacterial inactivation. This research provides new hints for air disinfection by DBD plasmas."

Furthermore, PRR9, PRR7, and PRR5 associate with the CCA1 and LHY promoters in vivo, coincident with the timing of decreased CCA1 and LHY expression. These results suggest that the repressor activities of PRR9, PRR7, and PRR5 on the CCA1 and LHY promoter regions constitute the molecular mechanism that accounts for the role of these proteins in the feedback loop of the circadian clock."

In Arabidopsis thaliana, ambient temperature affects the rhythmic accumulation of transcripts encoding the clock components TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1), GIGANTEA (GI), and the partially redundant genes CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY). The amplitude and peak levels increase for TOC1 and GI RNA rhythms as the temperature increases (from 17 to 27 degrees C), whereas they decrease for LHY. However, as temperatures decrease (from 17 to 12 degrees C), CCA1 and LHY RNA rhythms increase in amplitude and peak expression level. At 27 degrees C, a dynamic balance between GI and LHY allows temperature compensation in wild-type plants, but circadian function is impaired in lhy and gi mutant plants. However, at 12 degrees C, CCA1 has more effect on the buffering mechanism than LHY, as the cca1 and gi mutations impair circadian rhythms more than lhy at the lower temperature. At 17 degrees C, GI is apparently dispensable for free-running circadian rhythms, although partial GI function can affect circadian period. Numerical simulations using the interlocking-loop model show that balancing LHY/CCA1 function against GI and other evening-expressed genes can largely account for temperature compensation in wild-type plants and the temperature-specific phenotypes of gi mutants."

Although stigma is often studied at the individual level to focus on how stigma influences the mental and physical health of the stigmatized, considerable research has shown that stigma is multilevel and structural. This paper proposes a theoretical approach that synthesizes the literature on stigma with the literature on scapegoating and divide-and-rule as strategies that the wealthy and powerful use to maintain their power and wealth; the literatures on racial, gender, and other subordination; the literature on ideology and organization in sociopolitical systems; and the literature on resistance and rebellion against stigma, oppression and other forms of subordination. we develop a model of the ""stigma system"" as a dialectic of interacting and conflicting structures and processes. Understanding this system can help public health reorient stigma interventions to address the sources of stigma as well as the individual problems that stigma creates. On a broader level, this model can help those opposing stigma and its effects to develop alliances and strategies with which to oppose stigma and the processes that create it."

This study examined the role of cardiomyocyte DDT in the setting of heart failure. Patients with advanced heart failure undergoing transplantation demonstrated decreased cardiac DDT expression. To understand the effect of loss of cardiac DDT in experimental heart failure, cardiomyocyte-specific DDT-KO (DDT-cKO) and littermate control mice underwent surgical transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to induce cardiac pressure overload. DDT-cKO mice developed more rapid cardiac contractile dysfunction, greater cardiac dilatation, and pulmonary edema after TAC. Cardiomyocytes from DDT-cKO mice after TAC had impaired contractility, calcium transients, and reduced expression of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase. The DDT-cKO hearts also exhibited diminished angiogenesis with reduced capillary density and lower VEGF-A expression after TAC. In pharmacological studies, recombinant DDT (rDDT) activated endothelial cell ERK1/2 and Akt signaling and had proangiogenic effects in vitro. The DDT-cKO hearts also demonstrated more interstitial fibrosis with enhanced collagen and connective tissue growth factor expression after TAC. In cardiac fibroblasts, rDDT had an antifibrotic action by inhibiting TGF-β-induced Smad-2 activation. Thus, endogenous cardiomyocyte DDT has pleiotropic actions that are protective against heart failure."

CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1), as the core transcription factor of circadian clock, is involved in the regulation of endogenous circadian rhythm in Arabidopsis. Previous studies have shown that CCA1 consists of two abundant splice variants, fully spliced CCA1α and intron-retaining CCA1β. CCA1β is believed to form a nonfunctional heterodimer with CCA1α and its closed-related homolog LHY. Many studies have established that CCA1β is a transcription product, while how CCA1β protein is produced and how two CCA1 isoforms respond to environmental cues have not been elucidated. In this study, we identified CCA1α and CCA1β protein variants under different photoperiods with warm or cold temperature cycles, respectively. Our results showed that CCA1 protein production is regulated by prolonged light exposure and warm temperature. The protein levels of CCA1α and CCA1β peak in the morning, but the detection of CCA1β is dependent on immunoprecipitation enrichment at 22 °C. Higher temperature of 37 °C promotes CCA1β protein production and causes its retention to be detectable in the cytoplasm. Overall, our results indicate that two splice variants of the CCA1 protein respond to environmental light and temperature signals and may, therefore, maintain the circadian rhythms and give individuals the ability to adapt to environment."

More specifically this review summarized novel materials capable of producing an elevated response to low energy stimuli that are being extensively studied globally in recent years. Subsequently, the electro-response gels formulated by reinforcing selective materials such as electro-active polymers, conductive polymers, and piezoelectric materials were discussed. These gels are stimulated by application of low dosage of an electrical field to enhance their inherent mechanical and responsive attributes. This article further reviewed the theoretical understanding of simulation of some exclusive response parameters and forces to describe the deformation mechanism of electro-response materials.

Experimental evidence indicates that this feedback loop also is influenced by another oscillator. Support for this hypothesis comes from the characterization of the clock mutant toc1 (timing of cab expression) and the recent isolation of two candidate clock molecules, LHY (late elongated hypocotyl) and CCA1 (circadian clock associated). TOC1, as well as the LHY and CCA1 oscillatory feedback loops, influence several rhythmic physiological and molecular processes in Arabidopsis, including cyclic Atgrp7 gene expression.

Extensive research has uncovered the transcriptional control of plants' inner clock and has revealed at least some part of the intricate and elaborate regulatory mechanisms that govern plant diel responses and provide adaptation to the ever-changing environment. Here, we analyzed the proteome of the Arabidopsis thaliana mutant genotypes collected in the middle of the day and the middle of the night, including four mutants in the phytochrome (phyA, phyB, phyC, and phyD) and the circadian clock protein LHY. Our approach provided a novel insight into the diel regulations, identifying 640 significant changes in the night-day protein abundance. The comparison with previous studies confirmed that a large portion of identified proteins was a known target of diurnal regulation. However, more than 300 were novel oscillations hidden under standard growth chamber conditions or not manifested in the wild type. Our results indicated a prominent role for ROS metabolism and phytohormone cytokinin in the observed regulations, and the consecutive analyses confirmed that. The cytokinin signaling significantly increased at night, and in the mutants, the hydrogen peroxide content was lower, and the night-day variation seemed to be lost in the phyD genotype. Furthermore, regulations in the lhy and phyB mutants were partially similar to those found in the catalase mutant cat2, indicating shared ROS-mediated signaling pathways. Our data also shed light on the role of the relatively poorly characterized Phytochrome D, pointing to its connection to glutathione metabolism and the regulation of glutathione S-transferases."

The circadian clock plays pivotal roles in this process. In Arabidopsis, LHY, CCA1, ELF3, and other clock proteins play major roles in maintaining circadian rhythms. lhy;cca1 double mutants with severe defects in circadian rhythms showed accelerated flowering under short days (SDs), but delayed flowering under continuous light (LL). The protein level of the floral repressor SVP increased in lhy;cca1 mutants under LL, and the late-flowering phenotype of lhy;cca1 mutants was partially suppressed by svp, flc, or elf3. ELF3 interacted with both CCA1 and SVP, and elf3 suppressed the SVP accumulation in lhy;cca1 under LL. These results suggest that the unique mechanism of the inversion of the flowering response of lhy;cca1 under LL may involve both the ELF3-SVP/FLC-dependent and -independent pathways. In this work, elf3-1 seeds were mutagenized with heavy-ion beams and used to identify mutation(s) that delayed flowering under LL but not long days (LDs) or SDs even without ELF3. In this screening, seven candidate lines named suppressor of elf3 1 (self1), sel3, sel5, sel7, sel14, sel15, and sel20 were identified. Genetic analysis indicated that sel20 was a new deletion allele of a mutation in the blue light receptor, CRY2. A late-flowering phenotype and decrease of FT expression in the elf3;sel20 double mutant was obvious under LL but not under SDs or LDs. These results indicated that the late-flowering phenotype in the double mutant elf3;sel20 as well as in lhy;cca1 was affected by the presence of darkness.

Therefore, a better understanding of the dragon fruit SI mechanism is needed to improve breeding efficiency and ultimate production costs. To reveal the underlying mechanisms of SI in dragon fruit, plant anatomy, de novo RNA sequencing-based transcriptomic analysis, and multiple bioinformatic approaches were used to analyze gene expression in the pistils of the self-pollinated and cross-pollinated dragon fruit flowers at different intervals of time after pollination. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observed that the pollen of 'Hongshuijing', a self-incompatible dragon fruit variety (S. monacanthus), germinated on its own stigma. However, the pollen tube elongation has ceased at 1/2 of the style, confirming that dragon fruit experiences gametophyte self-incompatibility (GSI). We found that the pollen tube elongation in vitro was inhibited by self-style glycoproteins in the SI variety, indicating that glycoproteins were involved in SI. That is to say the female S factor should be homologous of S-RNase or PrsS (P. rhoeas stigma S factor), both of which are glycoproteins and are the female S factors of the two known GSI mechanism respectively. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that among the 43,954 assembled unigenes from pistil, there were six S-RNase genes, while 158 F-box genes were identified from a pollen transcriptomic dataset. There were no P. rhoeas type S genes discovered. Thus, the identified S-RNase and F-box represent the candidate female and male S genes, respectively. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the self and cross-pollinated pistils at different time intervals led to the identification of 6,353 genes. We then used a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to find some non-S locus genes in SI responses in dragon fruit. Additionally, 13 transcription factors (TFs) (YABBY4, ANL2, ERF43, ARF2, BLH7, KNAT6, PIF3, two OBF1, two HY5 and two LHY/CCA) were identified to be involved in dragon fruit GSI. Thus, we uncovered candidate S and non-S genes and predicted more SI-related genes for a more detailed investigation of the molecular mechanism of dragon fruit SI. Our findings suggest that dragon fruit possesses a GSI system and involves some unique regulators. This study lays the groundwork for future research into SI mechanisms in dragon fruit and other plant species."

However, nitrogen starvation and excessive nitrogen stress can cause stunted growth and development of walnut seedlings, and environmental pollution is also of concern. Therefore, it is necessary to study the mechanism of walnut seedling resistance to nitrogen stress. In this study, morphological and physiological observations and transcriptome sequencing of walnut seedlings under nitrogen starvation and excess nitrogen stress were performed. The results showed that walnut seedlings under nitrogen starvation and excess stress could adapt to the changes in the nitrogen environment by changing the coordination of their root morphology and physiological indexes. Based on an analysis of transcriptome data, 4911 differential genes (DEGs) were obtained (2180 were upregulated and 2731 were downregulated) in a comparison of nitrogen starvation and control groups. A total of 9497 DEGs (5091 upregulated and 4406 downregulated) were obtained in the comparison between the nitrogen overdose and control groups. When these DEGs were analysed, the differential genes in both groups were found to be significantly enriched in the plant's circadian pathway. Therefore, we selected the circadian rhythm as the focus for further analysis. We made some discoveries by analysing the gene co-expression network of nitrogen metabolism, circadian rhythm, and hormone signal transduction. (a) Nitrite nitrogen (NO2-) or Glu may act as a nitrogen signal to the circadian clock. (b) Nitrogen signalling may be input into the circadian clock by regulating changes in the abundance of the CRY1 gene. (c) After the nitrogen signal enters the circadian clock, the expression of the LHY gene is upregulated, which causes a phase shift in the circadian clock. (d) The RVE protein may send information about the circadian clock's response to nitrogen stress back to the nitrogen metabolic pathway via the hormone transduction pathway. In conclusion, various metabolic pathways in the roots of walnut seedlings coordinated with one another to resist the ill effects of nitrogen stress on the root cells, and these coordination relationships were regulated by the circadian clock. This study is expected to provide valuable information on the circadian clock regulation of plant resistance to nitrogen stress."

These studies identified homologues with seemingly conserved function, as well as frequent gene loss. In the present study, we aimed to identify candidate clock genes in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha using a more unbiased approach. To identify genes with circadian rhythm we sequenced the transcriptomes of gemmalings in a time series in constant light conditions. Subsequently, we performed functional studies using loss-of-function mutants and gene expression reporters. Among the genes displaying circadian rhythm, a homologue to the transcriptional co-repressor Arabidopsis DE-ETIOLATED1 showed high amplitude and morning phase. Because AtDET1 is arrhythmic and associated with the morning gene function of AtCCA1/LHY, that lack a homologue in liverworts, we functionally studied DET1 in M. polymorpha. We found that the circadian rhythm of MpDET1 expression is disrupted in loss-of-function mutants of core clock genes and putative evening-complex genes. MpDET1 knock-down in turn results in altered circadian rhythm of nyctinastic thallus movement and clock gene expression. We could not detect any effect of MpDET1 knock-down on circadian response to light, suggesting that MpDET1 has a yet unknown function in the M. polymorpha circadian clock."

However, PERI has been rarely demonstrated for well established species drawn from different genera. In particular, parallel molecular signatures for the same genes in response to similar habitat divergence in such different lineages is lacking. Here, based on whole-genome sequencing data, we first explore the speciation process in two sister species of Carpinus (Betulaceae) in response to divergence for temperature and soil-iron concentration in habitats they occupy in northern and southwestern China, respectively. We then determine whether parallel molecular mutations occur during speciation in this pair of species and also in another sister-species pair of the related genus, Ostryopsis, which occupy similarly divergent habitats in China. We show that gene flow occurred during the origin of both pairs of sister species since approximately 9.8 or approximately 2 million years ago, implying strong natural selection during divergence. Also, in both species pairs we detected concurrent positive selection in a gene (LHY) for flowering time and in two paralogous genes (FRO4 and FRO7) of a gene family known to be important for iron tolerance. These changes were in addition to changes in other major genes related to these two traits. The different alleles of these particular candidate genes possessed by the sister species of Carpinus were functionally tested and indicated likely to alter flowering time and iron tolerance as previously demonstrated in the pair of Ostryopsis sister species. Allelic changes in these genes may have effectively resulted in high levels of prezygotic reproductive isolation to evolve between sister species of each pair. Our results show that PERI can occur in different genera at different timescales and involve similar signatures of molecular evolution at genes or paralogues of the same gene family, causing reproductive isolation as a consequence of adaptation to similarly divergent habitats."

However, NO-induced late-flowering does not require FNR1 or CRY1. Sucrose supply counteracts the flowering delay induced by NO. However high-N-induced late-flowering could not be reversed by 5% sucrose supplementation. The high nitrogen condition decreased the amplitudes of all transcripts of the circadian clock. While NO increased the amplitudes of circadian transcripts of CRY1, LHY (LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL), CCA1 (CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1) and TOC1 (TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1), but decreased the amplitudes of circadian transcripts of CO (CONSTANS) and GI (GIGANTEA). 5% sucrose supplementation reversed the declines in amplitudes of circadian transcripts of CO and GI after the NO treatment. NO induced S-nitrosation modification on oscillators CO and GI, but not on the other oscillators of the circadian clock.

Leveraging chromosome-resolved plant genomes and syntenic ortholog analysis enabled tracing this genetic linkage back to Amborella trichopoda, a sister lineage to the angiosperm, and identifying an additional evolutionarily conserved genetic linkage in light signaling genes. The LHY/CCA1-PRR5/9, RVE4/8-PRR3/7, and PIF3-PHYA genetic linkages emerged in the bryophyte lineage and progressively moved within several genes of each other across an array of angiosperm families representing distinct whole-genome duplication and fractionation events. Soybean (Glycine max) maintained all but two genetic linkages, and expression analysis revealed the PIF3-PHYA linkage overlapping with the E4 maturity group locus was the only pair to robustly cycle with an evening phase, in contrast to the sMYB-PRR morning and midday phase. While most monocots maintain the genetic linkages, they have been lost in the economically important grasses (Poaceae), such as maize (Zea mays), where the genes have been fractionated to separate chromosomes and presence/absence variation results in the segregation of PRR7 paralogs across heterotic groups. The environmental robustness model is put forward, suggesting that evolutionarily conserved genetic linkages ensure superior microhabitat pollinator synchrony, while wide-hybrids or unlinking the genes, as seen in the grasses, result in heterosis, adaptation, and colonization of new ecological niches."

To gain more insight into the hormonal control of isoprene biosynthesis, the present study measured plant hormone concentrations in jasmonic acid (JA)-treated leaves of our previous model study, examined their relationship with gene expression of isoprene synthase (IspS) and hormone signalling transcription factors. Of the plant hormones, IAA and JA-Ile and their related transcription factors (MYC2 and SAUR21) were significantly correlated with IspS gene expression. Concentrations of cytokinins, isopentenyladenine (iP), trans-zeatin riboside (tZR) and cis-zeatin riboside (cZR), were similarly significantly correlated with IspS expression. However, there was no significant correlation between their related transcription factor (ARR-B) and IspS expression. The circadian clock-related gene PRR7, but not the transcription factor LHY, was highly correlated with IspS expression. These results suggest that the hormonal balance between JA-Ile and IAA plays a central role in transcriptional regulation of IspS through the transcription factors MYC2 and SAUR21, the early auxin responsive genes. The putative cis-acting elements for SAUR on the IspS promoter (TGTCNN and CATATG), in addition to the G-box for MYC2, support the above proposal. These results provide insightful information on the core components of plant hormone-related regulation of IspS under coordination with the circadian clock genes."

This pattern may be important for maintaining water-use efficiency and carbon sequestration simultaneously, but still lacks quantification. Here we use terrestrial laser scanning to quantify allometry variations of Quercus mongolica in semi-arid forests. With tree height (Height) declining, canopy area (CA) decreases with substantial variations. The theoretical CA-Height relationship in dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) matches only the 5th percentile of our results because of CA underestimation and Height overestimation by breast height diameter (DBH). Water supply determines Height variation (P = 0.000) but not CA (P = 0.2 in partial correlation). The decoupled functions of stem, hydraulic conductance and leaf spatial arrangement, may explain the inconsistency, which may further ensure hydraulic safety and carbon assimilation, avoiding forest dieback. Works on tree allometry pattern and determinant will effectively supply tree drought tolerance studying and support DGVM improvements."

Here, we reported that plant response to auxin is also strictly governed by clock. The amplitude of auxin-responsive gene expressions gradually declined from morning to the dusk, and then enhanced from dusk to dawn. Plants with defects in both CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and its closest homologue LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) (cca1 lhy) showed comparable responses to auxin at different time points in consecutive days, suggesting that CCA1 and LHY were required for gating auxin responses. Moreover, CCA1/LHY physically interacted with the core transcriptional repressors (Aux/IAA proteins), which might further modulate plant sensitivity to auxin. Taken together, we demonstrate that the central morning phased circadian oscillator CCA1 plays a pivotal role in gating auxin response."

Here, we estimate phytolith C sequestration in global terrestrial biomes. We used biome data including productivity, phytolith and silica contents, and the phytolith stability factor to preliminarily determine the size and distribution of the phytolith C sink in global terrestrial biomes. Total phytolith C sequestration in global terrestrial biomes is 156.7±91.6TgCO2yr-1. Grassland (40%), cropland (35%), and forest (20%) biomes are the dominant producers of phytolith-based carbon; geographically, the main contributors are Asia (31%), Africa (24%), and South America (17%). Practices such as bamboo afforestation/reforestation and grassland recovery for economic and ecological purposes could theoretically double the above phytolith C sink. The potential terrestrial phytolith C sequestration during 2000-2099 under such practices would be 15.7-40.5PgCO2, equivalent in magnitude to the C sequestration of oceanic diatoms in sediments and through silicate weathering. Phytolith C sequestration contributes vitally to the global C cycle, hence, it is essential to incorporate plant-soil silica cycling in biogeochemical C cycle models."

A 24-h circadian cycle starts with the peak expression of CCA1 at dawn. Although CCA1 is targeted by multiple transcriptional repressors, including PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR9 (PRR9), PRR7, PRR5 and CCA1 HIKING EXPEDITION (CHE), activators of CCA1 remain elusive. Here we use mathematical modelling to infer a co-activator role for LIGHT-REGULATED WD1 (LWD1) in CCA1 expression. We show that the TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1-CYCLOIDEA-PCF20 (TCP20) and TCP22 proteins act as LWD-interacting transcriptional activators. The concomitant binding of LWD1 and TCP20/TCP22 to the TCP-binding site in the CCA1 promoter activates CCA1. Our study reveals activators of the morning gene CCA1 and provides an action mechanism that ensures elevated expression of CCA1 at dawn to sustain a robust clock."

After dawn, photo-activated phytochromes translocate into the nucleus and interact with a family of negative basic helix-loop-helix PIF regulators. Subsequent phosphorylation and degradation of PIFs triggers a series of photomorphogenic responses. However, excess light can damage the photosynthetic apparatus and leads to photoinhibition. Plants acclimate to a balanced state of photomorphogenesis to avoid photodamage. Here, we show that upregulation of PIF4 expression by SHB1 and CCA1 under red light represents a desensitization step. After dawn, the highly expressed circadian clock protein CCA1 brings circadian signals to the regulatory region of the PIF4 signaling hub. Recruitment of SHB1 by CCA1 modulates red light-specific induction of PIF4 expression thus integrating circadian and light signals. As noon approaches and light intensity and ambient temperature tend to increase, the SHB1-CCA1 interaction sustains PIF4 expression to trigger thermomorphogenic responses to changing light and temperature conditions."

GENOME UNCOUPLED 4 (GUN4) has been shown to be required for the regulation of both chlorophyll synthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis and plastid retrograde signaling. In this study, we found that growth of the gun4 mutant was significantly improved under medium strong light (200 μmol photons m-2s-1) compared to normal light (100 μmol photons m-2s-1), in marked contrast to wild-type (WT). Further analysis revealed that GUN4 interacts with SIGNAL RECOGNITION PARTICLE 54 KDA SUBUNIT (SRP43) and SRP54. RNA-seq analysis indicated that the expression of genes for light signaling and the circadian clock is altered in gun4 compared with (WT). qPCR analysis confirmed that the expression of the clock genes CLOCK-RELATED 1 (CCA1), LATE ELONGATION HYPOCOTYL (LHY), TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1) and PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 7 (PRR7) is significantly changed in the gun4 and srp54 mutants under normal and medium strong light conditions.

To understand how the AS landscape of B. napus changes in response to abiotic stresses, we investigated 26 RNA-seq libraries, including control and treatments with cold, dehydration, salt, and abscisic acid (ABA) at two different time points, to perform comparative alternative splicing analysis. Apparently, AS events increased under all stresses except dehydration for 1 h, and intron retention was the most common AS mode. In addition, a total of 357 differential alternative splicing (DAS) genes were identified under four abiotic stresses, among which 81 DAS genes existed in at least two stresses, and 276 DAS genes were presented under only one stress. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) based on the splicing isoforms, rather than the genes, pinpointed out 23 co-expression modules associated with different abiotic stresses. Among them, a number of significant hub genes were also found to be DAS genes, which encode key isoforms involved in responses to single stress or multiple stresses, including RNA-binding proteins, transcription factors, and other important genes, such as RBP45C, LHY, MYB59, SCL30A, RS40, MAJ23.10, and DWF4. The splicing isoforms of candidate genes identified in this study could be a valuable resource for improving tolerance of B. napus against multiple abiotic stresses."
