However, the role of ATE1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. In this study, we find that ATE1 plays an essential role in growth and malignancy of liver cancer. ATE1 expression is significantly reduced in human HCC samples compared with normal liver tissue. In addition, low ATE1 expression is correlated with aggressive clinicopathologic features and is an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-free survival of patients with HCC. Lentivirus-mediated ATE1 knockdown significantly promoted liver cancer growth, migration, and disease progression in vitro and in vivo. Opposing results were observed when ATE1 was upregulated. Mechanistically, ATE1 accelerated the degradation of β-catenin and inhibited Wnt signaling by regulating turnover of Regulator of G Protein Signaling 5 (RGS5). Loss- and gain-of-function assays confirmed that RGS5 was a key effector of ATE1-mediated regulation of Wnt signaling. Further studies indicated that RGS5 might be involved in regulating the activity of GSK3-β, a crucial component of the cytoplasmic destruction complex. Treatment with a GSK inhibitor (CHIR99021) cooperated with ablation of ATE1 or RGS5 overexpression to promote Wnt/β-catenin signaling, but overexpression of ATE1 or RGS5 knockdown did not reverse the effect of GSK inhibitor. IMPLICATIONS: ATE1 inhibits liver cancer progression by suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling and can serve as a potentially valuable prognostic biomarker for HCC."

Herein, we report that ATE1 is overexpressed in NRAS-mutant melanomas, while it is downregulated in BRAF-mutant melanomas. ATE1 expression was higher in metastatic tumours, compared with primary tumours. Consistent with these findings, ATE1 depletion reduced melanoma cell viability, migration and colony formation. Reduced ATE1 expression also affected cell responses to mTOR and MEK inhibitors and to serum deprivation. Among putative ATE1 substrates is the tumour suppressor AXIN1, pointing to the possibility that ATE1 may fine-tune AXIN1 function in melanoma. Our findings highlight an unexpected role for ATE1 in melanoma cell aggressiveness and suggest that ATE1 constitutes a potential new therapeutic target."

Nt-Arg of a protein is among Nt-residues that can be recognized as destabilizing ones by the Arg/N-degron pathway. A proteolytic cleavage of a protein can generate Arg at the N terminus of a resulting C-terminal (Ct) fragment either directly or after Nt-arginylation of that Ct-fragment by the Ate1 arginyl-tRNA-protein transferase (R-transferase), which uses Arg-tRNAArg as a cosubstrate. Ate1 can Nt-arginylate Nt-Asp, Nt-Glu, and oxidized Nt-Cys* (Cys-sulfinate or Cys-sulfonate) of proteins or short peptides. Ate1 genes of fungi, animals, and plants have been cloned decades ago, but a three-dimensional structure of Ate1 remained unknown. A detailed mechanism of arginylation is unknown as well. We describe here the crystal structure of the Ate1 R-transferase from the budding yeast Kluyveromyces lactis. The 58-kDa R-transferase comprises two domains that recognize, together, an acidic Nt-residue of an acceptor substrate, the Arg residue of Arg-tRNAArg, and a 3'-proximal segment of the tRNAArg moiety. The enzyme's active site is located, at least in part, between the two domains. In vitro and in vivo arginylation assays with site-directed Ate1 mutants that were suggested by structural results yielded inferences about specific binding sites of Ate1. We also analyzed the inhibition of Nt-arginylation activity of Ate1 by hemin (Fe3+-heme), and found that hemin induced the previously undescribed disulfide-mediated oligomerization of Ate1. Together, these results advance the understanding of R-transferase and the Arg/N-degron pathway."

Here we used a knockout mouse model with conditional deletion of arginyltransferase (Ate1) in the nervous system and found that in retinal ON bipolar cells, where RGS7 modulates a G-protein to signal light increments, deletion of Ate1 raised the level of RGS7. Electroretinographs revealed that lack of Ate1 leads to increased light-evoked response sensitivities of ON-bipolar cells, as well as their downstream neurons. In cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), RGS7 was rapidly degraded via proteasome pathway and this degradation was abolished in Ate1 knockout MEF. Our results indicate that Ate1 regulates RGS7 protein level by facilitating proteasomal degradation of RGS7 and thus affects G-protein signaling in neurons."

To investigate whether arginylation affects actin-dependent processes in a simple model organism, Dictyostelium discoideum, we knocked out the gene encoding Ate1 and characterized the phenotype of ate1-null cells. Visualization of actin cytoskeleton dynamics by live-cell microscopy indicated significant changes in comparison to wild-type cells. Ate1-null cells were almost completely lacking focal actin adhesion sites at the substrate-attached surface and were only weakly adhesive. In two-dimensional chemotaxis assays toward folate or cAMP, the motility of ate1-null cells was increased. However, in three-dimensional chemotaxis involving more confined conditions, the motility of ate1-null cells was significantly reduced. Live-cell imaging showed that GFP-tagged Ate1 rapidly relocates to sites of newly formed actin-rich protrusions. By mass spectrometric analysis, we identified four arginylation sites in the most abundant actin isoform of Dictyostelium, in addition to arginylation sites in other actin isoforms and several actin-binding proteins. In vitro polymerization assays with actin purified from ate1-null cells revealed a diminished polymerization capacity in comparison to wild-type actin.

Multiple major biological pathways are linked to the fidelity of this process, including neural and cardiovascular developments, cell division, and even the stress response. Despite this significance, the structural, mechanistic, and regulatory mechanisms that govern ATE1 function remain enigmatic. To that end, we have used X-ray crystallography to solve the crystal structure of ATE1 from the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATE1 (ScATE1) in the apo form. The three-dimensional structure of ScATE1 reveals a bilobed protein containing a GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) fold, and this crystalline behavior is faithfully recapitulated in solution based on size-exclusion chromatography-coupled small angle X-ray scattering (SEC-SAXS) analyses and cryo-EM 2D class averaging. Structural superpositions and electrostatic analyses point to this domain and its domain-domain interface as the location of catalytic activity and tRNA binding, and these comparisons strongly suggest a mechanism for post-translational arginylation. Additionally, our structure reveals that the N-terminal domain, which we have previously shown to bind a regulatory [Fe-S] cluster, is dynamic and disordered in the absence of metal bound in this location, hinting at the regulatory influence of this region. When taken together, these insights bring us closer to answering pressing questions regarding the molecular-level mechanism of eukaryotic post-translational arginylation."

Here we analyzed the role of ATE1 in brain development and neuronal growth by producing a conditional mouse knockout with Ate1 deletion in the nervous system driven by Nestin promoter (Nes-Ate1 mice). These mice were weaker than wild type, resulting in low postnatal survival rates, and had abnormalities in the brain that suggested defects in neuronal migration. Cultured Ate1 knockout neurons showed a reduction in the neurite outgrowth and the levels of doublecortin and F-actin in the growth cones. In wild type, ATE1 prominently localized to the growth cones, in addition to the cell bodies. Examination of the Ate1 mRNA sequence reveals the existence of putative zipcode-binding sequences involved in mRNA targeting to the cell periphery and local translation at the growth cones. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that Ate1 mRNA localized to the tips of the growth cones, likely due to zipcode-mediated targeting, and this localization coincided with spots of localization of arginylated β-actin, which disappeared in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. We propose that zipcode-mediated co-targeting of Ate1 and β-actin mRNA leads to localized co-translational arginylation of β-actin that drives the growth cone migration and neurite outgrowth."

Here, we tested the possibility of Arg linkage to midchain sites within intact protein targets and found that many proteins in vivo are modified on the side chains of Asp and Glu by unconventional chemistry that targets the carboxy rather than the amino groups at the target sites. Such arginylation appears to be functionally regulated, and it can be directly mediated by ATE1, in addition to the more conventional ATE1-mediated linkage of Arg to the N-terminal alpha amino group. This midchain arginylation implies an unconventional mechanism of ATE1 action that likely facilitates its major biological role."

Previous evidence suggest a potential involvement of arginylation in stress response and this PTM was traditionally considered anti-apoptotic based on the studies of individual substrates. However, here we found that arginylation promotes cell death and/or growth arrest, depending on the nature and intensity of the stressing factor. Specifically, in yeast, mouse and human cells, deletion or downregulation of the ATE1 gene disrupts typical stress responses by bypassing growth arrest and suppressing cell death events in the presence of disease-related stressing factors, including oxidative, heat, and osmotic stresses, as well as the exposure to heavy metals or radiation. Conversely, in wild-type cells responding to stress, there is an increase of cellular Ate1 protein level and arginylation activity. Furthermore, the increase of Ate1 protein directly promotes cell death in a manner dependent on its arginylation activity. Finally, we found Ate1 to be required to suppress mutation frequency in yeast and mammalian cells during DNA-damaging conditions such as ultraviolet irradiation. Our study clarifies the role of Ate1/arginylation in stress response and provides a new mechanism to explain the link between Ate1 and a variety of diseases including cancer.

This effect of insulin is independent of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and its physiological relevance remains uncertain. Here we show that this TUG cleavage pathway regulates both insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle and organism-level energy expenditure. Using mice with muscle-specific Tug (Aspscr1)-knockout and muscle-specific constitutive TUG cleavage, we show that, after GLUT4 release, the TUG C-terminal cleavage product enters the nucleus, binds peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ and its coactivator PGC-1α and regulates gene expression to promote lipid oxidation and thermogenesis. This pathway acts in muscle and adipose cells to upregulate sarcolipin and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), respectively. The PPARγ2 Pro12Ala polymorphism, which reduces diabetes risk, enhances TUG binding. The ATE1 arginyltransferase, which mediates a specific protein degradation pathway and controls thermogenesis, regulates the stability of the TUG product. We conclude that insulin-stimulated TUG cleavage coordinates whole-body energy expenditure with glucose uptake, that this mechanism might contribute to the thermic effect of food and that its attenuation could promote obesity."

In minigenes, single and double mutations that disrupt base pairings in R1R3 and R3R4 lead to the loss of MXE splicing, while compensatory triple mutations that restore RNA structure revert splicing to that of the wild type. In the endogenous Ate1 pre-mRNA, blocking the competing base pairings by LNA/DNA mixmers complementary to R3 leads to the loss of MXE splicing, while the disruption of R2R5 interaction changes the ratio of MXE. That is, Ate1 splicing is controlled by two independent, dynamically interacting, and functionally distinct RNA structure modules. Exon 7a becomes more included in response to RNA Pol II slowdown, however it fails to do so when the ultra-long-range R2R5 interaction is disrupted, indicating that exon 7a/7b ratio depends on co-transcriptional RNA folding.

The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the sequential ubiquitination of lysine residues K284 to K214 in AKT and R-HSPA5 (the arginylated form of HSPA5), which contribute to the autophagic/lysosomal degradation of AKT when impaired proteasomal activity induces cellular stress. Results show that proteasome inhibitors (PIs) increased ATE1 (arginyltransferase 1)-mediated R-HSPA5 levels in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner. Further, binding of fully ubiquitinated AKT with R-HSPA5 induced AKT degradation via the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Specifically, the K48 (Lys48)-linked ubiquitinated form of AKT was selectively degraded in the lysosome with R-HSPA5. The deubiquitinase, USP7 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 7), prevented AKT degradation by inhibiting AKT ubiquitination via interaction with AKT. MUL1 (mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase activator of NFKB 1) also played a vital role in the lysosomal degradation of AKT by sequentially ubiquitinating AKT residues K284 to K214 for R-HSPA5-mediated autophagy. Consistent with this finding, despite HSPA5 arginylation, AKT was not degraded in mul1 KO cells. These results suggest that MUL1-mediated sequential ubiquitination of K284 to K214 may serve as a novel mechanism by which AKT is designated for lysosomal degradation. Moreover, binding of R-HSPA5 with fully ubiquitinated AKT is required for the autophagic/lysosomal degradation of AKT. Thus, modulating the MUL1-mediated non-proteasomal proteolysis mechanisms, such as sequential ubiquitination, may prove to be a novel therapeutic approach for cancer treatment.Abbreviations: AKT1: thymoma viral proto-oncogene 1; ATE1: arginyltransferase 1; ATG5: autophagy related 5; CASP3: caspase 3; EGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GSK3B; glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta; HA: hemagglutinin; HSPA5/GRP78/BIP: heat shock protein 5; LAMP1: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1; MAP1LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MEF: mouse embryonic fibroblast; MUL1: mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase activator of NFKB1; NAC: N-acetylcysteine; NEK2: NIMA (never in mitosis gene a)-related expressed kinase 2; NH4Cl: ammonium chloride; PARP1: poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family, member 1; PI: proteasome inhibitor; R-HSPA5: arginylated HSPA5; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SQSTM1: sequestome 1; Ub: ubiquitin; USP7: ubiquitin specific peptidase 7."

To characterize in detail the Nt-processing of actin, we used state-of-the-art proteomics. To estimate the relative cellular levels of Nt-modified proteoforms of actin, we employed NAA80-lacking cells, in which actin was not Nt-acetylated. We found that targeted proteomics is superior to a commercially available antibody previously used to analyze Nt-arginylation of β-actin. Significantly, despite the use of sensitive mass spectrometry-based techniques, we could not confirm the existence of the previously claimed Nt-arginylated β-actin (RDDI-) in either wildtype or NAA80-lacking cells. A very minor level of Nt-arginylation of the initially cleaved β-actin (DDDI-) could be identified, but only in NAA80-lacking cells, not in wildtype cells.

For example, arginylation of β-actin has been found to regulate lamellipodial formation at the leading edge in fibroblasts. This finding suggests that similar functions of β-actin in other cell types may also require arginylation. Here, we have tested the hypothesis that ATE1 regulates the cytoskeletal dynamics essential for in vivo platelet adhesion and thrombus formation. To test this hypothesis, we generated conditional knockout mice specifically lacking ATE1 in their platelets and in their megakaryocytes and analyzed the role of arginylation during platelet activation. Surprisingly, rather than finding an impairment of the actin cytoskeleton structure and its rearrangement during platelet activation, we observed that the platelet-specific ATE1 knockout led to enhanced clot retraction and in vivo thrombus formation. This effect might be regulated by myosin II contractility since it was accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain on Ser19, which is an event that activates myosin in vivo. Furthermore, ATE1 and myosin co-immunoprecipitate from platelet lysates. This finding suggests that these proteins directly interact within platelets. These results provide the first evidence that arginylation is involved in phosphorylation-dependent protein regulation, and that arginylation affects myosin function in platelets during clot retraction."

Breakpoint analysis via FISH with BAC clones and long-range PCR products revealed a disruption of the arginyltransferase 1 (ATE1) gene on translocation chromosome 10 and the solute carrier family 12, member 1 gene (SLC12A1) on translocation chromosome 15. SNP array analysis revealed neither loss nor gain of chromosomal regions in the affected child, and a targeted gene enrichment panel consisting of 130 known deafness genes was negative for pathogenic mutations.

Sanger sequencing of the 2 genes in the boy and 180 GJB2 mutation-negative hearing-impaired individuals did not detect homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic mutations. Our study demonstrates the many difficulties in unraveling the molecular causes of a heterogeneous phenotype. We cannot directly implicate disruption of ATE1 and/or SLC12A1 to the abnormal hearing phenotype; however, mutations in these genes may have a role in polygenic or multifactorial forms of hearing impairment. On the other hand, it is conceivable that our patient carries a disease-causing mutation in a so far unidentified deafness gene.

Arginylation plays essential roles in a variety of cellular processes, including cell migration, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal organization. Ate1 is associated with neuronal functions such as neurogenesis and neurite growth. However, the role of Ate1 in glial development, including oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation and myelination processes in the central nervous system, is poorly understood. The present study revealed a peak in Ate1 protein expression during myelination process in primary cultured OLs. Post-transcriptional downregulation of Ate1 reduced the number of OL processes, and branching complexity, in vitro. We conditionally ablated Ate1 from OLs in mice using 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase-Cre promoter (""Ate1-KO"" mice), to assess the role of Ate1 in OL function and axonal myelination in vivo. Immunostaining for OL differentiation markers revealed a notable reduction of mature OLs in corpus callosum of 14-day-old Ate1-KO, but no changes in spinal cord, in comparison with wild-type controls. Local proliferation of OL precursor cells was elevated in corpus callosum of 21-day-old Ate1-KO, but was unchanged in spinal cord. Five-month-old Ate1-KO displayed reductions of mature OL number and myelin thickness, with alterations of motor behaviors. Our findings, taken together, demonstrate that Ate1 helps maintain proper OL differentiation and myelination in corpus callosum in vivo, and that protein arginylation plays an essential role in developmental myelination."

The Arg/N-degron pathway targets proteins that bear destabilizing N-terminal residues for degradation by the proteasome or via autophagy. Under normoxic conditions, the N-terminal Cys (Nt-Cys) residues of specific substrates can be oxidized by dioxygenases such as plant cysteine oxidases and cysteamine (2-aminoethanethiol) dioxygenases and arginylated by ATE1 R-transferases to generate Arg-CysO2(H) (R-CO2). Proteins bearing the R-CO2 N-degron are targeted via Lys48 (K48)-linked ubiquitylation by UBR1/UBR2 N-recognins for proteasomal degradation. During acute hypoxia, such proteins are partially stabilized, owing to decreased Nt-Cys oxidation. Here, we show that if hypoxia is prolonged, the Nt-Cys of regulatory proteins can be chemically oxidized by ROS to generate Arg-CysO3(H) (R-CO3), a lysosomal N-degron. The resulting R-CO3 is bound by KCMF1, a N-recognin that induces K63-linked ubiquitylation, followed by K27-linked ubiquitylation by the noncanonical N-recognin UBR4. Autophagic targeting of Cys/N-degron substrates is mediated by the autophagic N-recognin p62/SQTSM-1/Sequestosome-1 through recognition of K27/K63-linked ubiquitin (Ub) chains. This Cys/N-degron-dependent reprogramming in the proteolytic flux is important for cellular homeostasis under both chronic hypoxia and oxidative stress. A small-compound ligand of p62 is cytoprotective under oxidative stress through its ability to accelerate proteolytic flux of K27/K63-ubiquitylated Cys/N-degron substrates. Our results suggest that the Nt-Cys of conditional Cys/N-degron substrates acts as an acceptor of O2 to maintain both O2 and ROS homeostasis and modulates half-lives of substrates through either the proteasome or lysosome by reprogramming of their Ub codes."

In mammals, the dysregulations of the ATE1 gene (ate1) is shown to be involved in cardiovascular abnormalities, cancer, and aging-related diseases. Although biochemical evidence suggested that arginylation may be involved in stress response and/or protein degradation, the physiological role of ATE1 in vivo has never been systematically determined. This gap of knowledge leads to difficulties for interpreting the involvements of ATE1 in diseases pathogenesis. Since ate1 is highly conserved between human and the unicellular organism Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe), we take advantage of the gene-knockout library of S. pombe, to investigate the genetic interactions between ate1 and other genes in a systematic and unbiased manner. By this approach, we found that ate1 has a surprisingly small and focused impact size. Among the 3659 tested genes, which covers nearly 75% of the genome of S. pombe, less than 5% of them displayed significant genetic interactions with ate1. Furthermore, these ate1-interacting partners can be grouped into a few discrete clustered categories based on their functions or their physical interactions. These categories include translation/transcription regulation, biosynthesis/metabolism of biomolecules (including histidine), cell morphology and cellular dynamics, response to oxidative or metabolic stress, ribosomal structure and function, and mitochondrial function. Unexpectedly, inconsistent to popular belief, very few genes in the global ubiquitination or degradation pathways showed interactions with ate1. Our results suggested that ATE1 specifically regulates a handful of cellular processes in vivo, which will provide critical mechanistic leads for studying the involvements of ATE1 in normal physiologies as well as in diseased conditions."

The mechanisms that regulate the functional balance among ATE1, RARS and translation are unknown. Here, we addressed the question of how these two enzymes can partition Arg-tRNAArg to functionally distinct pathways using an intracellular arginylation sensor in cell lines with overexpression or deletion of ATE1 and RARS isoforms. We found that arginylation levels depend on the physiological state of the cells but are not directly affected by translation activity or the availability of RARS isoforms. However, displacement of RARS from the multi-synthetase complex leads to an increase in intracellular arginylation independently of RARS enzymatic activity. This effect is accompanied by ATE1's redistribution into the cytosol.

At least six isoforms of mouse Ate1 are produced through alternative splicing of Ate1 pre-mRNA. We identified a previously uncharacterized mouse protein, termed Liat1 (ligand of Ate1), that interacts with Ate1 but does not appear to be its arginylation substrate. Liat1 has a higher affinity for the isoforms Ate1(1A7A) and Ate1(1B7A). Liat1 stimulated the in vitro N-terminal arginylation of a model substrate by Ate1. All examined vertebrate and some invertebrate genomes encode proteins sequelogous (similar in sequence) to mouse Liat1. Sequelogs of Liat1 share a highly conserved ∼30-residue region that is shown here to be required for the binding of Liat1 to Ate1. We also identified non-Ate1 proteins that interact with Liat1. In contrast to Liat1 genes of nonprimate mammals, Liat1 genes of primates are subtelomeric, a location that tends to confer evolutionary instability on a gene. Remarkably, Liat1 proteins of some primates, from macaques to humans, contain tandem repeats of a 10-residue sequence, whereas Liat1 proteins of other mammals contain a single copy of this motif. Quantities of these repeats are, in general, different in Liat1 of different primates.

This modification was originally noted in protein degradation during neurodegenerative processes, with an apparently different physiological relevance between central and peripheral nervous system. Subsequent studies have identified a steadily increasing number of proteins and proteolysis-derived polypeptides as arginyltransferase (ATE1) substrates, including β-amyloid, α-synuclein, and TDP43 proteolytic fragments. Arginylation is involved in signaling processes of proteins and polypeptides that are further ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. In addition, it is also implicated in autophagy/lysosomal degradation pathway. Recent studies using mutant mouse strains deficient in ATE1 indicate additional roles of this modification in neuronal physiology. As ATE1 is capable of modifying proteins either at the N-terminus or middle-chain acidic residues, determining which proteins function are modulated by arginylation represents a big challenge. Here, we review studies addressing various roles of ATE1 activity in nervous system function, and suggest future research directions that will clarify the role of post-translational protein arginylation in brain development and various neurological disorders. Arginyltransferase (ATE1), the enzyme responsible for post-translational arginylation, modulates the functions of a wide variety of proteins and polypeptides, and is also involved in the main degradation pathways of intracellular proteins.

However, little is known about what promotes the metastasis of prostate cancer and there is a lack of effective prognostic indicators, making it immensely difficult to manage options for treatment or surveillance. Arginyltransferase 1 (Ate1) is the enzyme mediating post-translational protein arginylation, which has recently been identified as a master regulator affecting many cancer-relevant pathways including stress response, cell cycle checkpoints, and cell migration/adhesion. However, the precise role of Ate1 in cancer remains unknown. In this study, we found the occurrence of metastasis of prostate cancer is inversely correlated with the levels of Ate1 protein and mRNA in the primary tumor. We also found that metastatic prostate cancer cell lines have a reduced level of Ate1 protein compared to non-metastatic cell lines, and that a depletion of Ate1 drives prostate cancer cells towards more aggressive pro-metastatic phenotypes without affecting proliferation rates. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a reduction of Ate1 can result from chronic stress, and that shRNA-reduced Ate1 increases cellular resistance to stress, and drives spontaneous and stress-induced genomic mutations. Finally, by using a prostate orthotropic xenograft mouse model, we found that a reduction of Ate1 was sufficient to enhance the metastatic phenotypes of prostate cancer cell line PC-3 in vivo. Our study revealed a novel role of Ate1 in suppressing prostate cancer metastasis, which has a profound significance for establishing metastatic indicators for prostate cancer, and for finding potential treatments to prevent its metastasis."

This proteolytic system recognizes proteins containing N-terminal degradation signals called N-degrons, polyubiquitylates these proteins, and thereby causes their degradation by the proteasome. The definitively identified (""canonical"") residues that are Nt-arginylated by R-transferase are N-terminal Asp, Glu, and (oxidized) Cys. Over the last decade, several publications have suggested (i) that Ate1 can also arginylate non-canonical N-terminal residues; (ii) that Ate1 is capable of arginylating not only α-amino groups of N-terminal residues but also γ-carboxyl groups of internal (non-N-terminal) Asp and Glu; and (iii) that some isoforms of Ate1 are specific for substrates bearing N-terminal Cys residues. In the present study, we employed arrays of immobilized 11-residue peptides and pulse-chase assays to examine the substrate specificity of mouse R-transferase. We show that amino acid sequences immediately downstream of a substrate's canonical (Nt-arginylatable) N-terminal residue, particularly a residue at position 2, can affect the rate of Nt-arginylation by R-transferase and thereby the rate of degradation of a substrate protein. We also show that the four major isoforms of mouse R-transferase have similar Nt-arginylation specificities in vitro, contrary to the claim about the specificity of some Ate1 isoforms for N-terminal Cys. In addition, we found no evidence for a significant activity of the Ate1 R-transferase toward previously invoked non-canonical N-terminal or internal amino acid residues. Together, our results raise technical concerns about earlier studies that invoked non-canonical arginylation specificities of Ate1."

Recent studies of protein arginylation implicated this poorly understood posttranslational modification in the functioning of actin cytoskeleton and in cell migration in culture. Knockout of arginyltransferase (Ate1) in mice leads to embryonic lethality and severe heart defects that are reminiscent of cell migration-dependent phenotypes seen in other mouse models. To test the hypothesis that arginylation regulates cell migration during morphogenesis, we produced Wnt1-Cre Ate1 conditional knockout mice (Wnt1-Ate1), with Ate1 deletion in the neural crest cells driven by Wnt1 promoter. Wnt1-Ate1 mice die at birth and in the first 2-3 weeks after birth with severe breathing problems and with growth and behavioral retardation. Wnt1-Ate1 pups have prominent defects, including short palate and altered opening to the nasopharynx, and cranial defects that likely contribute to the abnormal breathing and early death. Analysis of neural crest cell movement patterns in situ and cell motility in culture shows an overall delay in the migration of Ate1 knockout cells that is likely regulated by intracellular mechanisms rather than extracellular signaling events. Taken together, our data suggest that arginylation plays a general role in the migration of the neural crest cells in development by regulating the molecular machinery that underlies cell migration through tissues and organs during morphogenesis."

Ate1-KO fibroblasts can form large colonies in Matrigel and exhibit invasive behavior, unlike wild-type fibroblasts. Furthermore, Ate1-KO cells form tumors in subcutaneous xenograft assays in immunocompromised mice. Abnormal growth in these cells can be partially rescued by reintroduction of stably expressed specific Ate1 isoforms, which also reduce the ability of these cells to form tumors. Tumor array studies and bioinformatics analysis show that Ate1 is downregulated in several types of human cancer samples at the protein level, and that its transcription level inversely correlates with metastatic progression and patient survival.

We have recently shown that the autophagy receptor SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) is an N-recognin that binds the N-terminal arginine (Nt-Arg) as an N-degron to modulate autophagic proteolysis. Here, we show that the N-degron pathway mediates pexophagy, in which damaged peroxisomal fragments are degraded by autophagy under normal and oxidative stress conditions. This degradative process initiates when the Nt-Cys of ACAD10 (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family, member 10), a receptor in pexophagy, is oxidized into Cys sulfinic (CysO2) or sulfonic acid (CysO3) by ADO (2-aminoethanethiol (cysteamine) dioxygenase). Under oxidative stress, the Nt-Cys of ACAD10 is chemically oxidized by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The oxidized Nt-Cys2 is arginylated by ATE1-encoded R-transferases, generating the RCOX N-degron. RCOX-ACAD10 marks the site of pexophagy via the interaction with PEX5 and binds the ZZ domain of SQSTM1/p62, recruiting LC3+-autophagic membranes. In mice, knockout of either Ate1 responsible for Nt-arginylation or Sqstm1/p62 leads to increased levels of peroxisomes. In the cells from patients with peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), characterized by peroxisomal loss due to uncontrolled pexophagy, inhibition of either ATE1 or SQSTM1/p62 was sufficient to recover the level of peroxisomes. Our results demonstrate that the Cys-N-degron pathway generates an N-degron that regulates the removal of damaged peroxisomal membranes along with their contents.

Here, we employed the Cre-lox technique to uncover new physiological functions of N-terminal arginylation in adult mice.

Our data suggest that these actions of tannic acid are mediated by its direct effect on ATE1, which regulates protein degradation and angiogenesis in vivo."

To address this question, we generated cardiac muscle-specific Ate1 knockout mice, in which Ate1 deletion was driven by α-myosin heavy chain promoter (αMHC-Ate1 mouse). These mice were initially viable, but developed severe cardiac contractility defects, dilated cardiomyopathy, and thrombosis over time, resulting in high rates of lethality after 6months of age. These symptoms were accompanied by severe ultrastructural defects in cardiac myofibrils, seen in the newborns and far preceding the onset of cardiomyopathy, suggesting that these defects were primary and likely underlay the development of the future heart defects. Several major sarcomeric proteins were arginylated in vivo. Moreover, Ate1 deletion in the hearts resulted in a significant reduction of active and passive myofibril forces, suggesting that arginylation is critical for both myofibril structural integrity and contractility. Thus, arginylation is essential for maintaining the heart function by regulation of the major myofibril proteins and myofibril forces, and its absence in the heart muscle leads to progressive heart failure through cardiomyocyte-specific defects."

In this work, we show that ATE1s bind a previously undiscovered [Fe-S] cluster that is conserved across evolution. We characterize the nature of this [Fe-S] cluster and find that the presence of the [Fe-S] cluster in ATE1 is linked to its arginylation activity, both in vitro and in vivo, and the initiation of the yeast stress response. Importantly, the ATE1 [Fe-S] cluster is oxygen-sensitive, which could be a molecular mechanism of the N-degron pathway to sense oxidative stress. Taken together, our data provide the framework of a cluster-based paradigm of ATE1 regulatory control."

Ubiquitin-like processing of TUG (Aspscr1, UBXD9) proteins is a central mechanism to regulate this process. Here, recent advances in this area are reviewed. The data support a model in which intact TUG traps insulin-responsive ""GLUT4 storage vesicles"" at the Golgi matrix by binding vesicle cargoes with its N-terminus and matrix proteins with its C-terminus. Insulin stimulation liberates these vesicles by triggering endoproteolytic cleavage of TUG, mediated by the Usp25m protease. Cleavage occurs in fat and muscle cells, but not in fibroblasts or other cell types. Proteolytic processing of intact TUG generates TUGUL, a ubiquitin-like protein modifier, as the N-terminal cleavage product. In adipocytes, TUGUL modifies a single protein, the KIF5B kinesin motor, which carries GLUT4 and other vesicle cargoes to the cell surface. In muscle, this or another motor may be modified. After cleavage of intact TUG, the TUG C-terminal product is extracted from the Golgi matrix by the p97 (VCP) ATPase. In both muscle and fat, this cleavage product enters the nucleus, binds PPARγ and PGC-1α, and regulates gene expression to promote fatty acid oxidation and thermogenesis. The stability of the TUG C-terminal product is regulated by an Ate1 arginyltransferase-dependent N-degron pathway, which may create a feedback mechanism to control oxidative metabolism. Although it is now clear that TUG processing coordinates glucose uptake with other aspects of physiology and metabolism, many questions remain about how this pathway is regulated and how it is altered in metabolic disease in humans."

Our findings suggest that Ate1 knock out (KO) cells are more susceptible to heat stress compared with its wild-type counterparts due to the induction of apoptosis in KO cells. Gene expression analysis of inducible heat-shock proteins (HSP70.1, HSP70.3, and HSP40) showed induction of these genes in KO cells early in the heat shock, but were drastically diminished at the later period of heat shock. Further analysis revealed that loss of ATE1 drastically reduced the stability of all three HSP mRNAs. These phenotypes were greatly restored by overexpression of Ate1 in KO cells. Our findings show that arginylation plays a protective role during heat stress by regulating HSP gene expression and mRNA stability."

The conjugation of Arg is mediated by arginyltransferase, encoded by ATE1. Through its regulated degradation of specific proteins, the arginylation branch of the N-end rule pathway mediates, in particular, the cardiovascular development, the fidelity of chromosome segregation, and the control of signaling by nitric oxide. We show that mouse ATE1 specifies at least six mRNA isoforms, which are produced through alternative splicing, encode enzymatically active arginyltransferases, and are expressed at varying levels in mouse tissues. We also show that the ATE1 promoter is bidirectional, mediating the expression of both ATE1 and an oppositely oriented, previously uncharacterized gene.

Purified isoforms of arginyltransferase that contain the alternative first exons differentially arginylate these proteins in extract from ATE1(-/-) embryos, suggesting that specific isoforms may have distinct functions. Although the N-end rule pathway is apparently confined to the cytosol and the nucleus, and although GRP78 and protein-disulfide isomerase are located largely in the endoplasmic reticulum, recent evidence suggests that these proteins are also present in the cytosol and other compartments in vivo, where they may become N-end rule substrates."

Cardiac overexpression of Gα(q) rescued ATE1-deficient embryos from thin myocardium and ventricular septal defect but not from vascular defects, genetically dissecting vascular defects from cardiac defects. The misregulation in cardiovascular signaling can be attributed in part to the failure in hypoxia-sensitive degradation of RGS4, a GTPase-activating protein for Gα(q).

Ckmm-Ate1 mice were viable and outwardly normal; however, their skeletal muscle strength was significantly reduced in comparison to controls. Mass spectrometry of isolated skeletal myofibrils showed a limited set of proteins, including myosin heavy chain, arginylated on specific sites. Atomic force microscopy measurements of contractile strength in individual myofibrils and isolated myosin filaments from these mice showed a significant reduction of contractile forces, which, in the case of myosin filaments, could be fully rescued by rearginylation with purified Ate1. Our results demonstrate that arginylation regulates force production in muscle and exerts a direct effect on muscle strength through arginylation of myosin."

The search for a potential mechanism linking PD to RA and OA continues, as it could play a significant role in disease prevention and treatment. Recent studies have linked RA, OA, and PD to Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG), a periodontal bacterium, through a similar dysregulation in an inflammatory mechanism. This study aimed to identify potential gene signatures that could assist in early diagnosis as well as gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of these diseases. The expression data sets with the series IDs GSE97779, GSE123492, and GSE24897 for macrophages of RA, OA synovium, and PG stimulated macrophages (PG-SM), respectively, were retrieved and screened for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The 72 common DEGs among RA, OA, and PG-SM were further subjected to gene-gene correlation analysis. A GeneMANIA interaction network of the 47 highly correlated DEGs comprises 53 nodes and 271 edges. Network centrality analysis identified 15 hub genes, 6 of which are DEGs (API5, ATE1, CCNG1, EHD1, RIN2, and STK39). Additionally, two significantly up-regulated non-hub genes (IER3 and RGS16) showed interactions with hub genes. Functional enrichment analysis of the genes showed that ""apoptotic regulation"" and ""inflammasomes"" were among the major pathways. These eight genes can serve as important signatures/targets, and provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of PG-induced RA, OA, and PD."

In eukaryotes, the amino acid l-arginine (l-Arg) is conjugated to N-terminal Asp (Nt-Asp), Glu, Gln, Asn, and Cys, directly or associated with posttranslational modifications. Following Nt-arginylation, the Nt-Arg is recognized by UBR boxes of N-recognins such as UBR1, UBR2, UBR4/p600, and UBR5/EDD, leading to substrate ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation via the N-end rule pathway. It has been a mystery, however, why studies for the past five decades identified only a handful of Nt-arginylated substrates in mammals, although five of 20 principal amino acids are eligible for arginylation. Here, we show that the Nt-Arg functions as a bimodal degron that directs substrates to either the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome system (UPS) or macroautophagy depending on physiological states. In normal conditions, the arginylated forms of proteolytic cleavage products, D101-CDC6 and D1156-BRCA1, are targeted to UBR box-containing N-recognins and degraded by the proteasome. However, when proteostasis by the UPS is perturbed, their Nt-Arg redirects these otherwise cellular wastes to macroautophagy through its binding to the ZZ domain of the autophagic adaptor p62/STQSM/Sequestosome-1. Upon binding to the Nt-Arg, p62 acts as an autophagic N-recognin that undergoes self-polymerization, facilitating cargo collection and lysosomal degradation of p62-cargo complexes. A chemical mimic of Nt-Arg redirects Ub-conjugated substrates from the UPS to macroautophagy and promotes their lysosomal degradation. Our results suggest that the Nt-Arg proteome of arginylated proteins contributes to reprogramming global proteolytic flux under stresses."

G., Brower, C. S., Wang, H., Davydov, I. V., Sheng, J., Zhou, J., Kwon, Y. T., and Varshavsky, A. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 32559-32573). In this work, we began analyzing this gene, termed Dfa (divergent from Ate1). Mouse Dfa was found to be transcribed from both the bidirectional P(Ate1/Dfa) promoter and other nearby promoters. The resulting transcripts are alternatively spliced, yielding a complex set of Dfa mRNAs that are present largely, although not exclusively, in the testis. A specific Dfa mRNA encodes, via its 3'-terminal exon, a 217-residue protein termed Dfa(A). Other Dfa mRNAs also contain this exon. Dfa(A) is sequelogous (similar in sequence) to a region of the human/mouse HTEX4 protein, whose physiological function is unknown. We produced an affinity-purified antibody to recombinant mouse Dfa(A) that detected a 35-kDa protein in the mouse testis and in several cell lines. Experiments in which RNA interference was used to down-regulate Dfa indicated that the 35-kDa protein was indeed Dfa(A). Furthermore, Dfa(A) was present in the interchromatin granule clusters and was also found to bind to the Ggnbp1 gametogenetin-binding protein-1 and to the Abt1 activator of basal transcription that interacts with the TATA-binding protein. Given these results, RNA interference was used to probe the influence of Dfa levels in luciferase reporter assays. We found that Dfa(A) acts as a repressor of TATA-box transcriptional promoters."

These two systems coordinate the removal of unwanted intracellular materials, but the mechanism by which they achieve this synchronization is largely unknown. The ubiquitination of substrates serves as a universal degradation signal for both systems. Our study revealed that the amino-terminal Arg, a canonical N-degron in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, also acts as a degradation signal in autophagy. We showed that many ER residents, such as BiP, contain evolutionally conserved arginylation permissive pro-N-degrons, and that certain inducers like dsDNA or proteasome inhibitors cause their translocation into the cytoplasm where they bind misfolded proteins and undergo amino-terminal arginylation by arginyl transferase 1 (ATE1). The amino-terminal Arg of BiP binds p62, which triggers p62 oligomerization and enhances p62-LC3 interaction, thereby stimulating autophagic delivery and degradation of misfolded proteins, promoting cell survival. This study reveals a novel ubiquitin-independent mechanism for the selective autophagy pathway, and provides an insight into how these two major protein degradation pathways communicate in cells to dispose the unwanted proteins."

Lack of arginylation leads to increased α-syn aggregation and causes the formation of larger pathological aggregates in neurons, accompanied by impairments in its ability to be cleared via normal degradation pathways. In the mouse brain, lack of arginylation leads to an increase in α-syn's insoluble fraction, accompanied by behavioral changes characteristic for neurodegenerative pathology.

Mice lacking the enzyme arginyltransferase in skeletal muscles exhibit reduced contractile forces that have been linked to a reduction in myosin cross-bridge formation. The role of arginylation in passive skeletal myofibril forces has never been investigated. In this study, we used single sarcomere and myofibril measurements and observed that lack of arginylation leads to a pronounced reduction in passive forces in skeletal muscles. Mass spectrometry indicated that skeletal muscle titin, the protein primarily linked to passive force generation, is arginylated on five sites located within the A band, an important area for protein-protein interactions. We propose a mechanism for passive force regulation by arginylation through modulation of protein-protein binding between the titin molecule and the thick filament. Key points are as follows: 1) active and passive forces were decreased in myofibrils and single sarcomeres isolated from muscles lacking arginyl-tRNA-protein transferase (ATE1). 2) Mass spectrometry revealed five sites for arginylation within titin molecules. All sites are located within the A-band portion of titin, an important region for protein-protein interactions. 3) Our data suggest that arginylation of titin is required for proper passive force development in skeletal muscles."

In search of a factor responsible for these phenomena, the current study identified human antigen R (HuR) as a direct target of arginylation. HS induced arginylation of HuR affected its stability and RNA binding activity. Arginylated HuR failed to bind Hsp70.3 3' UTR, allowing the recruitment of cleavage stimulating factor 64 (CstF64) in the proximal poly-A-site (PAS), generating transcripts with short 3'UTR. However, HuR from Ate1 knock out (KO) MEFs bound to proximal PAS region with higher affinity, thus excluded CstF64 recruitment. This inhibited the alternative polyadenylation (APA) of Hsp70.3 mRNA and generated the unstable transcripts with long 3'UTR. The inhibition of RNA binding activity of HuR was traced to arginylation-coupled phosphorylation of HuR, by check point kinase 2 (Chk2). Arginylation of HuR occurred at the residue D15 and the arginylation was needed for the phosphorylation. Accumulation of HuR also decreased cell viability upon HS. In conclusion, arginylation dependent modifications of HuR maintained its cellular homeostasis, and promoted APA of Hsp70.3 pre-mRNA, during early HS response."

Cellular levels of arginylated calreticulin (R-CRT) are regulated in part by the proteasomal system. Under various stress conditions, R-CRT becomes associated with stress granules (SGs) or reaches the plasma membrane (PM), where it participates in pro-apoptotic signaling. The mechanisms underlying the resistance of tumor cells to apoptosis induced by specific drugs remain unclear. We evaluated the regulatory role of R-CRT in apoptosis of human glioma cell lines treated with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BT). Two cell lines (HOG, MO59K) displaying distinctive susceptibility to apoptosis induction were studied further. BT efficiency was found to be correlated with a subcellular distribution of R-CRT. In MO59K (apoptosis-resistant), R-CRT was confined to SGs formed following BT treatment. In contrast, HOG (apoptosis-susceptible) treated with BT showed lower SG formation and higher levels of cytosolic and PM R-CRT. Increased R-CRT level was associated with enhanced mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and with sustained apoptosis activation via upregulation of cell death receptor DR5. R-CRT overexpression in the cytoplasm of MO59K rendered the cells susceptible to BT-induced, DR5-mediated cell death. Our findings suggest that R-CRT plays an essential role in the effect of BT treatment on tumor cells and that ATE1 is a strong candidate target for future studies of cancer diagnosis and therapy."

We previously isolated a mouse strain with an amelogenesis imperfecta phenotype (ATE1 mice) from a dominant ethylnitrosourea screen and mapped the disease-causing defect to a 9-cM region of mouse chromosome 5. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that there is a mutation in enamelin (ENAM) or ameloblastin (AMBN), both of which are located within the linkage region, by sequencing these two candidate genes. Analysis of our data shows that the amelogenesis imperfecta phenotype is linked to a C > T transition in exon 8 of the enamelin gene. The mutation predicts a C826T transition, which is present in the enamelin transcript and changes the glutamine (Gln) codon at position 176 into a premature stop codon (Gln176X). Conversely, no mutation could be detected in the ameloblastin gene. These results define the ATE1 mice as a model for local hypoplastic autosomal-dominant amelogenesis imperfecta (AIH2), which is caused by enamelin truncation mutations in humans."

To date, little is known about how cells modulate SQSTM1 activity and autophagosome biogenesis in response to accumulating cargoes. In this study, we show that SQSTM1 is an N-recognin whose ZZ domain binds N-terminal arginine (Nt-Arg) and other N-degrons (Nt-Lys, Nt-His, Nt-Trp, Nt-Phe, and Nt-Tyr) of the N-end rule pathway. The substrates of SQSTM1 include the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-residing chaperone HSPA5/GRP78/BiP. Upon N-end rule interaction with the Nt-Arg of arginylated HSPA5 (R-HSPA5), SQSTM1 undergoes self-polymerization via disulfide bonds of Cys residues including Cys113, facilitating cargo collection. In parallel, Nt-Arg-bound SQSTM1 acts as an inducer of autophagosome biogenesis and autophagic flux. Through this dual regulatory mechanism, SQSTM1 plays a key role in the crosstalk between the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy. Based on these results, we employed 3D-modeling of SQSTM1 and a virtual chemical library to develop small molecule ligands to the ZZ domain of SQSTM1. These autophagy inducers accelerated the autophagic removal of mutant HTT (huntingtin) aggregates. We suggest that SQSTM1 can be exploited as a novel drug target to modulate autophagic processes in pathophysiological conditions."

The loss of arginylation disrupts a diverse set of fundamental cellular processes from proliferation to death. In the current study, role of arginylation in cell differentiation is investigated. Using in vitro preadipocyte differentiation model, it was observed that the inhibition or knockout (KO) of arginyltransferase 1 (ATE1) severely hindered differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes. Absence of arginylation inhibited expression of two key adipogenic transcription factors PPARγ and C/EBPα, and their downstream adipogenic genes (FABP4, GLUT4, PLN1). Arginylation did not affect the induction of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, the up-stream regulators of PPARγ gene. However, absence of arginylation affected PPARγ protein expression, independent of its transcript level. The constitutive expression of PPARγ1 protein in Ate1 KO cells as well as ATE1 inhibitor treated wild type cells were dampened due to increased proteasome mediated degradation of PPARγ1 in the absence of arginylation in the cells. Taken together these observations suggested arginylation mediated transcriptional regulation of PPARγ and C/EBPα was downstream of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, and that the arginylation mediated regulation of PPARγ protein expression may play a role in this process. The inhibition of arginylation in mature adipocytes also reduced expression of lipogenesis genes and decreased fat accumulation in differentiated adipocytes. Thus, the current study shows that arginylation is essential for preadipocyte differentiation and maturation which are thought to be key factors in the maintenance of adipose tissue homeostasis."

If a substrate bears, for example, Nt-Asn, its targeting involves deamidation of Nt-Asn, arginylation of resulting Nt-Asp, binding of resulting (conjugated) Nt-Arg to the UBR1-RAD6 E3-E2 ubiquitin ligase, ligase-mediated synthesis of a substrate-linked polyubiquitin chain, its capture by the proteasome, and substrate's degradation. We discovered that the human Nt-Asn-specific Nt-amidase NTAN1, Nt-Gln-specific Nt-amidase NTAQ1, arginyltransferase ATE1, and the ubiquitin ligase UBR1-UBE2A/B (or UBR2-UBE2A/B) form a complex in which NTAN1 Nt-amidase binds to NTAQ1, ATE1, and UBR1/UBR2. In addition, NTAQ1 Nt-amidase and ATE1 arginyltransferase also bind to UBR1/UBR2. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Nt-amidase, arginyltransferase, and the double-E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR1-RAD6/UFD4-UBC4/5 are shown to form an analogous targeting complex. These complexes may enable substrate channeling, in which a substrate bearing, for example, Nt-Asn, would be captured by a complex-bound Nt-amidase, followed by sequential Nt modifications of the substrate and its polyubiquitylation at an internal Lys residue without substrate's dissociation into the bulk solution. At least in yeast, the UBR1/UFD4 ubiquitin ligase interacts with the 26S proteasome, suggesting an even larger Arg/N-degron-targeting complex that contains the proteasome as well. In addition, specific features of protein-sized Arg/N-degron substrates, including their partly sequential and partly nonsequential enzymatic modifications, led us to a verifiable concept termed ""superchanneling."" In superchanneling, the synthesis of a substrate-linked poly-Ub chain can occur not only after a substrate's sequential Nt modifications, but also before them, through a skipping of either some or all of these modifications within a targeting complex."
