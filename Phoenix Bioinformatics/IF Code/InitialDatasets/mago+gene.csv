Nine division cycles produce seven somatic cells and 32 spermatids, where size and position define identity. Spermatids undergo de novo formation of basal bodies in a particle known as a blepharoplast. We are interested in mechanisms responsible for spermatogenous initial formation. Mago nashi (Mv-mago) is a highly conserved gene present as stored mRNA and stored protein in the microspore. Mv-mago protein increases in abundance during development and it localizes at discrete cytoplasmic foci (Mago-dots). RNA interference experiments show that new Mv-mago protein is required for development. With Mv-mago silenced, asymmetric divisions become symmetric, cell fate is disrupted, and development stops. The alpha-tubulin protein distribution, centrin translation, and Mv-PRP19 mRNA distribution are no longer restricted to the spermatogenous cells. Centrin aggregations, resembling blepharoplasts, occur in jacket cells. Mago-dots are undetectable after the silencing of Mv-mago, Mv-Y14, or Mv-eIF4AIII, three core components of the exon junction complex (EJC), suggesting that Mago-dots are either EJCs in the cytoplasm, or Mv-mago protein aggregations dependent on EJCs. Mv-mago protein and other EJC components apparently function in cell fate determination in developing male gametophytes of M. vestita."

Early in oogenesis, Gurken protein, a member of the transforming growth factor alpha family, is produced by the oocyte to induce the adiacent follicle cells to adopt a posterior cell fate. These cells subsequently send an unidentified signal back to the oocyte to induce the formation of a polarised microtubule array that defines the anterior-posterior axis. The polarised microtubules also direct the movement of the nucleus and gurken mRNA from the posterior to the anterior of the oocyte, where Gurken signals a second time to induce the dorsal follicle cells, thereby polarising the dorsal-ventral axis."

In homozygous mutant mago females reared at 17 degrees C, mago+ function is reduced, the inviable embryos lack abdominal segments and 84-98% of the embryos die. In contrast, at 25 degrees C, some mago alleles produce a novel gene product capable of inducing the formation of symmetrical double abdomen embryos. Reciprocal temperature-shift experiments indicate that the temperature-sensitive period is during oogenetic stages 7-14. Furthermore, embryos collected from mago1 homozygous females contain no apparent functional posterior determinants in the posterior pole. In viable F1 progeny from mago mutant females, regardless of genotype and temperature, polar granules are reduced or absent and germ cells fail to form (the grandchildless-like phenotype). Thus, we propose that the mago+ product is a component of the posterior determinative system, required during oogenesis, both for germ cell determination and delineation of the longitudinal axis of the embryo."

The Mago Nashi:Tsunagi/Y14 heterodimer also serves as the core of the exon junction complex (EJC), a multiprotein complex assembled on spliced mRNAs. In previous studies, reduced function alleles of mago nashi and tsunagi/Y14 were used to characterize the roles of the genes in oogenesis. Here, we investigated mago nashi and tsunagi/Y14 using null alleles and clonal analysis. Germline clones lacking mago nashi function divide but fail to differentiate. The mago nashi null germline stem cells produce clones over a period of at least 11 days, suggesting that mago nashi is not necessary for stem cell self-renewal. However, germline stem cells lacking tsunagi/Y14 function are indistinguishable from wild type. Additionally, in tsunagi/Y14 null germline cysts, centrosomes and oocyte-specific components fail to concentrate within a single cell and oocyte fate is not restricted to a single cell. Together, our results suggest not only that mago nashi is required for germline stem cell differentiation but that surprisingly mago nashi functions independently of tsunagi/Y14 in this process. On the other hand, Tsunagi/Y14 is essential for restricting oocyte fate to a single cell and may function with mago nashi in this process."

Use of the GA-sensitive semidwarfing gene Rht13 avoids this pleiotropic effect. Here, we show that Rht13 encodes a nucleotide-binding site/leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) gene. A point mutation in the semidwarf Rht-B13b allele autoactivates the NB-LRR gene and causes a height reduction comparable with Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b in diverse genetic backgrounds. The autoactive Rht-B13b allele leads to transcriptional up-regulation of pathogenesis-related genes including class III peroxidases associated with cell wall remodeling. Rht13 represents a new class of reduced height (Rht) gene, unlike other Rht genes, which encode components of the GA signaling or metabolic pathways. This discovery opens avenues to use autoactive NB-LRR genes as semidwarfing genes in a range of crop species, and to apply Rht13 in wheat breeding programs using a perfect genetic marker."

RNAi has been widely used for functional analysis of specific genes in various cells and organisms. In this paper, we tested the potential of silencing the expression of the Mago nashi gene in Schistosoma japonicum by siRNAs derived from shRNA expressed by mammalian Pol III promoter H1. Schistosomula, transformed from cercariae by mechanical shearing of the tails, were electroporated with Mago nashi shRNA expression vector. Aliquots of parasites were harvested at days 1, 3, and 5 after electroporation, respectively. Levels of Mago nashi mRNA and protein were determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. The results showed that shRNA expressed from mammalian Pol III promoter H1 specifically reduced the levels of Mago nashi mRNA and proteins in S. japonicum. Changes in testicular lobes were apparent when parasites were introduced into mammalian hosts. Thus, vector-mediated gene silencing is applicable to S. japonicum, which provides a means for the functional analysis of genes in this organism."

These cellular roles are visible as defects in development when Mago gene expression is modified in mutant model animal systems. Mago gene orthologs exist in plants, however, their functional roles in growth and development have not been well studied. Using an RNA interference (RNAi) approach, we produced transgenic Arabidopsis plants that had reduced levels of AtMago mRNA. RNAi-AtMago plants were delayed in their overall development, produced a greater number of leaves, and possessed short and occasionally fasciated stems. The leaves were small in size and demonstrated enhanced curling along their length. Shoot meristems of RNAi-AtMago plants lacked the cellular organization of wildtype meristems. Shoot meristematic cells were extensively vacuolated and large intercellular spaces were evident. RNAi-AtMago plants produced short lateral roots that lacked normal cell profiles and demonstrated premature root hair differentiation. The arrangement of microspore tetrads in RNAi-AtMago plants was aberrant, and microspores were extensively vacuolated. Pollen production and pollen germination rates were also reduced. RNAi-AtMago plants occasionally produced aborted seeds, or demonstrated delayed seed development that resulted in non-viable seed. The range of developmental defects visible in RNAi-AtMago plants and the ubiquitous expression of AtMago indicates that Mago has essential functions in most, if not all plant cell types."

MAGO (short form of MAGO NASHI) and Y14 (also Tsunagi or RBM8) are the EJC core components. Their biological roles have been well investigated in various species, but the evolutionary patterns of the two gene families and their protein-protein interactions are poorly known. Genome-wide survey suggested that the MAGO and Y14 two gene families originated in eukaryotic organisms with the maintenance of a low copy. We found that the two protein families evolved slowly; however, the MAGO family under stringent purifying selection evolved more slowly than the Y14 family that was under relative relaxed purifying selection. MAGO and Y14 were obliged to form heterodimer in a eukaryotic organism, and this obligate mode was plesiomorphic. Lack of binding of MAGO to Y14 as functional barrier was observed only among distantly species, suggesting that a slow co-evolution of the two protein families. Inter-protein co-evolutionary signal was further quantified in analyses of the Tol-MirroTree and co-evolution analysis using protein sequences. About 20% of the 41 significantly correlated mutation groups (involving 97 residues) predicted between the two families was clade-specific. Moreover, around half of the predicted co-evolved groups and nearly all clade-specific residues fell into the minimal interaction domains of the two protein families. The mutagenesis effects of the clade-specific residues strengthened that the co-evolution is required for obligate MAGO-Y14 heterodimerization mode. In turn, the obliged heterodimerization in an organism serves as a strong functional constraint for the co-evolution of the MAGO and Y14 families. Such a co-evolution allows maintaining the interaction between the proteins through large evolutionary time scales. Our work shed a light on functional evolution of the EJC genes in eukaryotes, and facilitates to understand the co-evolutionary processes among protein families."

The EJC core is composed of eIF4A3, MAGO, Y14 and MLN51. Few accessory proteins, such as CWC22 or UPF3, bind transiently to the EJC. The EJC has been implicated in the control of the splicing of long introns. To ascertain whether the EJC controls the splicing of short introns, we used Paramecium tetraurelia as a model organism, since it has thousands of very tiny introns. To elucidate whether EJC affects intron splicing in P. tetraurelia, we searched for EJC protein-coding genes, and silenced those genes coding for eIF4A3, MAGO and CWC22. We found that P. tetraurelia likely assembles an active EJC with only three of the core proteins, since MLN51 is lacking. Silencing of eIF4A3 or CWC22 genes, but not that of MAGO, caused lethality. Silencing of the MAGO gene caused either an increase, decrease, or no change in intron retention levels of some intron-containing mRNAs used as reporters. We suggest that a fine-tuning expression of EJC genes is required for steady intron removal in P. tetraurelia. Taking into consideration our results and those published by others, we conclude that the EJC controls splicing independently of the intron size."

MAGO and Y14, the two core subunits of the exon junction complex (EJC), form obligate heterodimers in eukaryotes. In Oryza sativa L. (rice), each of the two genes has two homologs, designated OsMAGO1 and OsMAGO2, and OsY14a and OsY14b, respectively. Here, we characterized a 16-amino acida peptide aptamer (PAP) for the rice MAGO proteins. PAP and rice Y14 bound competitively to rice MAGO proteins. Specifically targeting the MAGO proteins by expressing the aptamer in transgenic rice plants did not affect the endogenous synthesis and accumulation of MAGO proteins; however, the phenotypic variations observed in multiple organs phenocopied those of transgenic rice plants harboring RNA interference (RNAi) constructs in which the accumulation of MAGO and/or OsY14a transcripts and MAGO proteins was downregulated severely. Morphologically, the aptamer transgenic plants were short with abnormally developed flowers, and the stamens exhibited reduced degradation and absorption of both the endothecium and tapetum, thus confirming that EJC core heterodimers play essential roles in rice development, growth and reproduction. This study reveals that as a complementary approach of RNAi, peptide aptamers are powerful tools for interfering with the function of proteins in higher plants."

The MAGO NASHIs are highly conserved genes that encode proteins known to be involved in RNA physiology and many other developmental processes including germ cell differentiation in animals. However, their structural and functional implications in plants as fertility function proteins remained fragmented. MAGO (shorter name of MAGO NASHI) proteins form heterodimers with MPF2-like MADS-box proteins which are recruited in calyx identity and male fertility in Solanaceous plants. Four MAGO genes namely WsMAGO1 and WsMAGO2 and TaMAGO1 and TaMAGO2 were isolated from Withania somnifera and Tubocapsicum anomalum, respectively. These genes have duplicated probably due to whole genome duplication event. Dysfunction of WsMAGO2 through double-stranded RNAi in Withania revealed suppression of RNA transcripts, non-viable pollens, fewer flowers and aborted non-viable seeds in the developing berry suggesting a role of this protein in many traits particularly male fertility. WsMAGO2 flaunted stronger yeast 2-hybrid interactions with MPF2-like proteins WSA206, WSB206 and TAB201 than other MAGO counterparts. The native transcripts of WsMAGO2 culminated in stamens and seed-bearing berries though other MAGO orthologs also exhibited expression albeit at lower level. Coding sequences of the two orthologs are highly conserved, but they differ substantially in their upstream promoter regions. Remarkably, WsMAGO2 promoter is enriched with many anther-specific cis-motifs common in fertility function genes promoters. Among them, disruption of GAATTTGTGA abolished YFP/GUS gene expression in anthers alluding towards its involvement in regulating expression of MAGO in anther. Our findings support a possible recruitment of WsMAGO2 in fertility trait in Withania. These genes have practical application in hybrid production through cytoplasmic male sterility maintenance for enhancement in crops yield."

Zebrafish mago nashi codes for a small protein with no clearly identified functional domains, and which is highly conserved during evolution. This paper describes the identification and a detailed gene expression analysis of zebrafish mago nashi during development. Our results demonstrate that mago nashi encodes a maternal transcript detected in both blastomeres and yolk cell at the 1-2 cell stages, and in the blastoderm during segmentation. We show that a putative microtubule-mediated transport of mago nashi mRNA from the vegetal hemisphere into animal blastomeres determines the localization of the transcript in the animal pole, immediately after fertilization. Furthermore, the microtubule array contained into the yolk cell seems to be responsible for the high level of mago nashi transcript detected in the central blastomeres at the 8-16 cell stages. Zygotic mago nashi is expressed into the dorsal-marginal region during gastrulation, and starting from somitogenesis to 24 hpf, the expression domain becomes progressively restricted to the developing neural tube and paraxial structures, and ventrally to the pronephric ducts."

Here we determined the effects of Magoh mutations equivalent to those of Drosophila mago nashi mutant proteins that cause mis-localization of oskar mRNA. We found that Magoh I90T mutation caused mis-localization of Magoh protein in the cytoplasm by reducing its binding activity to Y14. On the other hand, G18R mutation did not affect its binding to Y14, but this mutation reduced its association with spliced mRNAs.

Restriction fragment length polymorphisms and transcript alterations associated with mago nashi mutations were used to identify the mago nashi locus within a chromosomal walk. The mago nashi locus was sequenced and found to encode a 147 amino acid protein with no similarity to proteins of known or suspected function. The identification of the mago nashi locus was confirmed by sequencing mutant alleles and by P element-mediated transformation. Nonsense mutations in mago nashi, as well as a deletion of the 5' coding sequences, result in zygotic lethality. The original mago nashi allele disrupts the localization of oskar mRNA and staufen protein to the posterior pole of the oocyte during oogenesis; anterior localization of bicoid mRNA is unaffected by the mutation.

Genomic DNA gel blot analysis indicates that two copies of the mago nashi gene exist in the rice genome, one of which has identical intron positions to those found in an Arabidopsis homolog. mago nashi is expressed in root, leaf and developing seed tissue as determined by RNA and protein gel blot analysis. Evidence from Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans and human studies of Mago Nashi suggests that a major function of this protein is its involvement in RNA localization.

Little is known about the biochemical and cellular characteristics of the EJC and its orthologs in plants. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis Mago and Y14 form a ternary complex with PYM, an RNA-binding protein that was previously shown to interact with the Mago-Y14 heterodimer in Drosophila. Fluorescence microscopy indicated that Arabidopsis Mago and Y14 are localized primarily in the nucleus, whereas PYM is mostly cytoplasmic. In vitro pull-down assays using recombinant proteins showed that the amino-terminal region of the Arabidopsis PYM interacts with the Mago-Y14 heterodimer, a similar observation to that previously reported for the animal versions of these proteins. However, we demonstrated also that Arabidopsis PYM has the ability to interact with monomeric Mago and monomeric Y14. Immunoprecipitation and tandem affinity purification from whole cell extracts detected a subtle interaction between the Arabidopsis Mago-Y14 heterodimer and PYM in flowers, indicating that the ternary complex is not abundant in plant cells. The regions of the polypeptide responsible for nuclear import and export were defined using protein truncations and site-directed mutagenesis.

Heterotopic expression of MPF2, a MADS-box gene, in reproductive tissues is a key component in the evolution of the inflated calyx syndrome in Physalis, but RNAi studies demonstrate that MPF2 has also acquired a role in male fertility in Physalis floridana. Using the yeast 2-hybrid system, we have now identified numerous MPF2-interacting MADS-domain proteins from Physalis, including homologs of SOC1, AP1, SEP1, SEP3, AG, and AGL6. Among the many non-MADS-domain proteins recovered was a homolog of MAGO NASHI, a highly conserved RNA-binding protein known to be involved in many developmental processes including germ cell differentiation. Two MAGO genes, termed P. floridana mago nashi1 (PFMAGO1) and PFMAGO2, were isolated from P. floridana. Both copies were found to be coexpressed in leaves, fruits, and, albeit at lower level, also in roots, stems, and flowers. DNA sequence analysis revealed that, although the coding sequences of the 2 genes are highly conserved, they differ substantially in their intron and promoter sequences. Two-hybrid screening of a Physalis expression library with both PFMAGO1 and PFMAGO2 as baits yielded numerous gene products, including an Y14-like protein. Y14 is an RNA-binding protein that forms part of various ""gene expression machines.""

Loss of Mago prevents epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, due to a large reduction in MAPK mRNA levels. MAPK expression also requires the EJC subunits Y14 and eIF4AIII and EJC-associated splicing factors. Mago depletion does not affect the transcription or stability of MAPK mRNA but alters its splicing pattern. MAPK expression from an exogenous promoter requires Mago only when the template includes introns. MAPK is the primary functional target of mago in eye development; in cultured cells, Mago knockdown disproportionately affects other large genes located in heterochromatin.

Here, we show various aspects of the divergence of each duplicated MAGO NASHI (MAGO) and Y14 gene pair in rice (Oryza sativa) encoding the putative EJC core subunits that form the obligate MAGO-Y14 heterodimers. OsMAGO1, OsMAGO2, and OsY14a were constitutively expressed in all tissues, while OsY14b was predominantly expressed in embryonic tissues. OsMAGO2 and OsY14b were more sensitive to different stresses than OsMAGO1 and OsY14a, and their encoded protein pair shared 93.8% and 46.9% sequence identity, respectively. Single MAGO down-regulation in rice did not lead to any phenotypic variation; however, double gene knockdowns generated short rice plants with abnormal flowers, and the stamens of these flowers showed inhibited degradation and absorption of both endothecium and tapetum, suggesting that OsMAGO1 and OsMAGO2 were functionally redundant. OsY14a knockdowns phenocopied OsMAGO1OsMAGO2 mutants, while down-regulation of OsY14b failed to induce plantlets, suggesting the functional specialization of OsY14b in embryogenesis. OsMAGO1OsMAGO2OsY14a triple down-regulation enhanced the phenotypes of OsMAGO1OsMAGO2 and OsY14a down-regulated mutants, indicating that they exert developmental roles in the MAGO-Y14 heterodimerization mode. Modified gene expression was noted in the altered developmental pathways in these knockdowns, and the transcript splicing of UNDEVELOPED TAPETUM1 (OsUDT1), a key regulator in stamen development, was uniquely abnormal. Concomitantly, MAGO and Y14 selectively bound to the OsUDT1 premessenger RNA, suggesting that rice EJC subunits regulate splicing.

In this work, the functional and molecular interactions of Arabidopsis homologues of Mago, Y14, and PYM, three EJC components that participate in intron-mediated enhancement of gene expression in animals, have been analysed. AtMago, AtY14, and AtPYM are encoded by single genes that show similar expression patterns and contain common regulatory elements, known as site II, that are required for expression. AtPYM and AtY14 are phosphorylated by plant extracts and this modification regulates complex formation between both proteins. In addition, overexpression of AtMago and AtY14 in plants produces an increase in AtPYM protein levels, while overexpression of AtPYM results in increased formation of a complex that contains the three proteins. The effect of AtMago and AtY14 on AtPYM expression is most likely to be due to intron-mediated enhacement of AtPYM expression, since the AtPYM gene contains a leader intron that is required for expression. Indeed, transient transformation asssays indicated that the three proteins are able to increase expression from reporter constructs that contain leader introns required for the expression of different genes. The results indicate that the plant homologues of Mago, Y14, and PYM are closely interconnected, not only through their function as EJC components but also at different steps of their own gene expression mechanisms, probably reflecting the importance of their interaction for the correct expression of plant genes."

This reciprocal signaling results in the asymmetric localization of mRNAs and proteins critical for these oogenic processes. Mago Nashi protein interprets the posterior follicle cell-to-oocyte signal to establish the major axes and to determine the fate of the primordial germ cells. Using the yeast two-hybrid system we have identified an RNA-binding protein, Tsunagi, that interacts with Mago Nashi protein. The proteins coimmunoprecipitate and colocalize, indicating that they form a complex in vivo. Immunolocalization reveals that Tsunagi protein is localized within the posterior oocyte cytoplasm during stages 1-5 and 8-9, and that this localization is dependent on wild-type mago nashi function. When tsunagi function is removed from the germ line, egg chambers develop in which the oocyte nucleus fails to migrate, oskar mRNA is not localized within the posterior pole, and dorsal-ventral pattern abnormalities are observed. These results show that a Mago Nashi-Tsunagi protein complex is required for interpreting the posterior follicle cell-to-oocyte signal to define the major body axes and to localize components necessary for determination of the primordial germ cells."

A. Newmark et al., 1997, Development 120, 3197-3207). We have used RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) to analyze the phenotypic consequences of impairing mag-1 function in C. elegans. We show here that mag-1(RNAi) causes masculinization of the germ line (Mog phenotype) in RNA-injected hermaphrodites, suggesting that mag-1 is involved in hermaphrodite germ-line sex determination. Epistasis analysis shows that ectopic sperm production caused by mag-1(RNAi) is prevented by loss-of-function (lf) mutations in fog-2, gld-1, fem-1, fem-2, fem-3, and fog-1, all of which cause germ-line feminization in XX hermaphrodites, but not by a her-1(lf) mutation which causes germ-line feminization only in XO males. These results suggest that mag-1 interacts with the fog, fem, and gld genes and acts independently of her-1. We propose that mag-1 normally allows oogenesis by inhibiting function of one or more of these masculinizing genes, which act during the fourth larval stage to promote transient sperm production in the hermaphrodite germ line. When the Mog phenotype is suppressed by a fog-2(lf) mutation, mag-1(RNAi) also causes lethality in the progeny embryos of RNA-injected, mated hermaphrodites, suggesting an essential role for mag-1 during embryogenesis. The defective embryos arrest during morphogenesis with an apparent elongation defect. The distribution pattern of a JAM-1::GFP reporter, which is localized to boundaries of hypodermal cells, shows that hypodermis is disorganized in these embryos. The temporal expression pattern of the mag-1 gene prior to and during morphogenesis appears to be consistent with an essential role of mag-1 in embryonic hypodermal organization and elongation."

The multi-protein exon junction complex (EJC) associates with mRNAs concomitant with splicing in the nucleus and plays important roles in export, translation, surveillance and localization of mRNAs in the cytoplasm. In mammalian cells, the ribosome associated protein PYM (HsPYM) binds the Y14-Mago heterodimer moiety of the EJC core, and disassembles EJCs, presumably during the pioneer round of translation. However, the significance of the association of the EJC with mRNAs in a physiological context has not been tested and the function of PYM in vivo remains unknown. Here we address PYM function in Drosophila, where the EJC core proteins are genetically required for oskar mRNA localization during oogenesis. We provide evidence that the EJC binds oskar mRNA in vivo. Using an in vivo transgenic approach, we show that elevated amounts of the Drosophila PYM (DmPYM) N-terminus during oogenesis cause dissociation of EJCs from oskar RNA, resulting in its mislocalization and consequent female sterility. We find that, in contrast to HsPYM, DmPYM does not interact with the small ribosomal subunit and dismantles EJCs in a translation-independent manner upon over-expression. Biochemical analysis shows that formation of the PYM-Y14-Mago ternary complex is modulated by the PYM C-terminus revealing that DmPYM function is regulated in vivo. Furthermore, we find that whereas under normal conditions DmPYM is dispensable, its loss of function is lethal to flies with reduced y14 or mago gene dosage. Our analysis demonstrates that the amount of DmPYM relative to the EJC proteins is critical for viability and fertility. This, together with the fact that the EJC-disassembly activity of DmPYM is regulated, implicates PYM as an effector of EJC homeostasis in vivo."

This complex probably has important functions in post-splicing events including nuclear export and nonsense-mediated decay of mRNA. We show that Y14 binds to two previously reported components, Aly/REF and RNPS1, and to the mRNA export factor TAP. Moreover, we identified magoh, a human homolog of the Drosophila mago nashi gene product, as a novel component of the complex. Magoh binds avidly and directly to Y14 and TAP, but not to other known components of the complex, and is found in Y14-containing mRNPs in vivo. Importantly, magoh also binds to mRNAs produced by splicing upstream (approximately 20 nucleotides) of exon- exon junctions and its binding to mRNA persists after export. These experiments thus reveal specific protein-protein interactions among the proteins of the splicing-dependent mRNP complex and suggest an important role for the highly evolutionarily conserved magoh protein in this complex."

We hypothesized that the EJC is involved in the regulation of gene expression during the stress response in cardiac myocytes, with implications for the failing heart. In cultured rat neonatal myocytes, we examined the cellular distribution of two EJC components eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A isoform 3 (eIF4A3) and mago nashi homologue (Mago) in response to metabolic stress. There was significant relocalization of eIF4A3 and Mago from the nucleus to cytoplasm following 18 h of hypoxia. Treating myocytes with 50 mM NaN3 for 4 h to mimic the metabolic stress induced by hypoxia also resulted in significant relocalization of eIF4A3 and Mago to the cytoplasm. To examine whether the effects of metabolic stress on the EJC proteins were dependent on the metabolic sensor AMP kinase (AMPK), we treated myocytes with 1 μM dorsomorphin (DM) in combination with NaN3 DM augmented the translocation of Mago and eIF4A3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Knockdown of eIF4A3 resulted in cessation of cell contractility 96 h post-treatment and a significant reduction in the number of intact sarcomeres. Cell area was significantly reduced by both hypoxia and eIF4A3 knockdown, whilst eIF4A3 knockdown also significantly reduced nuclear size. The reduction in nuclear size is unlikely to be related to apoptosis as it was reversed in combination with hypoxia. These data suggest for the first time that eIF4A3 and potentially other EJC members play an important role in the myocyte stress response, cell contractility and morphology."

Magoh, a homolog of the Drosophila mago nashi gene product, is a component of the splicing-dependent exon-exon junction complex (EJC). We show that, in addition to ccnb1 and cks2, magoh is also a dosage suppressor of the mouse temperature-sensitive cdc2 mutant, and synthetic enhancement of the cdc2 ts phenotype by RNA interference (RNAi) of magoh is observed in a manner similar to RNAi of cks2. Moreover, the depletion of magoh by RNAi causes cold-sensitive defects in the cell cycle transition, and exogenous cks2 expression partially suppresses the defect. Consistent with the genetic evidence, magoh RNAi caused defects in the expression of Cdc2 or Cks proteins, and introns of cks genes strongly affected protein expression levels. Thus, these data suggest that mouse Magoh is related to cell cycle regulation."

We aim to develop effective protocols for application of RNAi technology in the intra-mammalian life stages of Schistosoma japonicum. In this work, the expression of the parasite gene encoding cathepsin B1 (SjCB1) was targeted by exposing the worms to 10 μg of long dsRNA dissolved in 0.1 ml of 0.7% NaCl injected into the tail vein of infected mice. This method was effective and specific for eliciting SjCB1 gene suppression in both male and female adult worms in vivo (>79.4% in male and >91.5% in female knockdown relative to control). In 60 cercaria infected mice, RNAi suppression of gene expression was best achieved by using 10 μg of target dsRNA for at least 4 days. The recommended procedure for interference producing long-term suppression was an injection of dsRNA on the first day of infection with booster injections administered every 4 days for up to 26 days. Long-term suppression of three published functional genes (peroxiredoxin-1, mago nashi, insulin receptor) in S. japonicum provided more information about the role of the expression of these genes in producing particular phenotypes. The protocols described here may be more convenient, economical and applicable, than currently available technology and have contributed to the observation of more phenotypes during worm development from schistosomula to adult.

Although Barentsz localization in the germ line depends on Mago-Y14, no direct interaction between these proteins has been detected. Here, we demonstrate that the translation initiation factor eIF4AIII interacts with Barentsz and is a component of the oskar messenger RNP localization complex.

Recombinants with substantially shortened alien chromatin were produced for both genes, which confer resistance to stem rust races in the TTKSK (Ug99) lineage and representative races of all Australian stem rust lineages. Selected recombinants were back crossed into adapted Australian cultivars and PCR markers were developed to facilitate the incorporation of these genes into future wheat varieties. Our recombinants and those from several other labs now show that Sr32, Sr39, and SrAes7t on the short arm and Sr47 and SrAes1t on the long arm of 2S#1 form two linkage groups and at present no rust races are described that can distinguish these resistance specificities."

Several highly diverged -pathogen classes have independently evolved haustoria, suggesting that they represent an effective adaptation for growing within living plant tissue. Despite their clear importance in biotrophy, they have been difficult to study due to the close association of biotrophic pathogens with their host and the inability to produce haustoria in vitro. These drawbacks have been circumvented in the study of rust fungi by the development of a haustoria isolation technique. The strong binding of the lectin concanavalin A (ConA) to rust haustoria allows these structures to be purified from infected plant tissue by affinity chromatography on a ConA-Sepharose macrobead column. The isolation process results in substantial yields of intact haustoria that retain their cytoplasmic contents, making them amenable to experimentation. The construction of cDNA libraries from isolated rust haustoria and their subsequent sequence analysis have provided significant insight into haustoria function at a molecular level, revealing important roles in nutrient acquisition and the delivery of pathogenicity effector proteins. The generation of a rust haustorium-specific cDNA library is described in this chapter."

In contrast to wheat with 60 designated stem rust (Sr) resistance genes, barley's genetic variation for stem rust resistance is very narrow with only ten resistance genes genetically identified. Of these, only one complex locus consisting of three genes is effective against TTKSK, a widely virulent Pgt race of the Ug99 tribe which emerged in Uganda in 1999 and has since spread to much of East Africa and parts of the Middle East. The objective of this study was to assess the functionality, in barley, of cloned wheat Sr genes effective against race TTKSK. Sr22, Sr33, Sr35 and Sr45 were transformed into barley cv. Golden Promise using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. All four genes were found to confer effective stem rust resistance. The barley transgenics remained susceptible to the barley leaf rust pathogen Puccinia hordei, indicating that the resistance conferred by these wheat Sr genes was specific for Pgt. Furthermore, these transgenic plants did not display significant adverse agronomic effects in the absence of disease. Cloned Sr genes from wheat are therefore a potential source of resistance against wheat stem rust in barley."

This report demonstrates that several cereal rust species (Puccinia graminis f. sp tritici, P. triticina, P. striiformis, and P. hordei) can infect rice and produce all the infection structures necessary for plant colonization, including specialized feeding cells (haustoria). Some rust infection sites are remarkably large and many plant cells are colonized, suggesting that nutrient uptake occurs to support this growth. Rice responds with an active, nonhost resistance (NHR) response that prevents fungal sporulation and that involves callose deposition, production of reactive oxygen species, and, occasionally, cell death. Genetic variation for the efficacy of NHR to wheat stem rust and wheat leaf rust was observed. Unlike cereal rusts, the rust pathogen (Melampsora lini) of the dicotyledenous plant flax (Linum usitatissimum) rarely successfully infects rice due to an apparent inability to recognize host-derived signals. Morphologically abnormal infection structures are produced and appressorial-like structures often don't coincide with stomata. These data suggest that basic compatibility is an important determinate of nonhost infection outcomes of rust diseases on cereals, with cereal rusts being more capable of infecting a cereal nonhost species compared with rust species that are adapted for dicot hosts."

In this study, we performed RNA-sequencing of breast cancer (BrCa) clinical specimens to identify tumor-suppressive miRNA in BrCa. In total, 64 miRNA were identified as candidate tumor-suppressive miRNA in BrCa cells. Analysis of our BrCa signature revealed that several miRNA duplexes (guide strand/passenger strand) derived from pre-miRNA were downregulated in BrCa tissues (e.g. miR-99a-5p/-3p, miR-101-5p/-3p, miR-126-5p/-3p, miR-143-5p/-3p, and miR-144-5p/-3p). Among these miRNA, we focused on miR-101-5p, the passenger strand of pre-miR-101, and investigated its tumor-suppressive roles and oncogenic targets in BrCa cells. Low expression of miR-101-5p predicted poor prognosis in patients with BrCa (overall survival rate: P = 0.0316). Ectopic expression of miR-101-5p attenuated aggressive phenotypes, e.g. proliferation, migration, and invasion, in BrCa cells. Finally, we identified seven putative oncogenic genes (i.e. High Mobility Group Box 3, Epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1, GINS complex subunit 1 (GINS1), Tumor Protein D52, Serine/Arginine-Rich Splicing Factor Kinase 1, Vang-like protein 1, and Mago Homolog B) regulated by miR-101-5p in BrCa cells.

Furthermore, we explored the oncogenic roles of GINS1, whose function had not been previously elucidated, in BrCa cells. Aberrant expression of GINS1 mRNA and protein was observed in BrCa clinical specimens, and high GINS1 expression significantly predicted poor prognosis in patients with BrCa (overall survival rate: P = 0.0126). Knockdown of GINS1 inhibited the malignant features of BrCa cells. Thus, identification of tumor-suppressive miRNA and molecular networks controlled by these miRNA in BrCa cells may be an effective strategy for elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis of this disease."

However, identification of the most important regulators has not been performed to date. Here, we employed two methods, namely, a two-round SSH and two-factor transcriptome analysis derived from the two-factor ANOVA that is commonly used in the statistics, to identify development-associated inorganic phosphate (Pi) starvation-induced genes in Brassica napus. Several of these genes are related to ethylene signaling (such as EIN3, ACO3, ACS8, ERF1A, and ERF2) or sugar metabolism (such as ACC2, GH3, LHCB1.4, XTH4, and SUS2). Although sucrose and ethylene may counteract each other at the biosynthetic level, they may also work synergistically on Pi-starvation-induced gene expression (such as PT1, PT2, RNS1, ACP5, AT4, and IPS1) and root acid phosphatase activation. Furthermore, three new transcription factors that are responsive to Pi starvation were identified: the zinc-finger MYND domain-containing protein 15 (MYND), a Magonashi family protein (MAGO), and a B-box zinc-finger family salt-tolerance protein.

Overexpression of EZH2 can silence important tumor suppressor genes leading to increased invasiveness of many types of cancers. This makes the inhibition of EZH2 an important target in the development of cancer therapeutics. We employed a three-stage computational de novo peptide design method to design inhibitory peptides of EZH2. The method consists of a sequence selection stage and two validation stages for fold specificity and approximate binding affinity. The sequence selection stage consists of an integer linear optimization model that was solved to produce a rank-ordered list of amino acid sequences with increased stability in the bound peptide-EZH2 structure. These sequences were validated through the calculation of the fold specificity and approximate binding affinity of the designed peptides. Here we report the discovery of novel EZH2 inhibitory peptides using the de novo peptide design method. The computationally discovered peptides were experimentally validated in vitro using dose titrations and mechanism of action enzymatic assays. The peptide with the highest in vitro response, SQ037, was validated in nucleo using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics. This peptide had an IC50 of 13.5 mM, demonstrated greater potency as an inhibitor when compared to the native and K27A mutant control peptides, and demonstrated competitive inhibition versus the peptide substrate. Additionally, this peptide demonstrated high specificity to the EZH2 target in comparison to other histone methyltransferases. The validated peptides are the first computationally designed peptides that directly inhibit EZH2. These inhibitors should prove useful for further chromatin biology investigations."

To study the expression of those genes throughout first stages of spermatogenesis, we used nylon macroarray. Gonads in stage of immaturity (stage I), or at initiation of spermatogonial proliferation (stage II), meiosis (stage III) or spermiogenesis were selected by histological analysis. Total RNA was extracted and then used to produce complex targets labelled with [33P]dCTP and hybridised with cDNA arrays. After filtering and normalisation of hybridisation signals, genes presenting differential expression as revealed by ANOVA analysis were submitted to k-means clustering and hierarchical classification. Genes were separated into five clusters which presented distinct profiles. One cluster overexpressed in stage I could be involved in the initial events of spermatogenesis as seminiferous tubule organisation. The second cluster displays a transient increase at the beginning of testicular recrudescence (stage II). Three other clusters group several genes involved in cell proliferation and protein synthesis and modification. One is particularly down-expressed during stage I, the two others show increased expression during stages III and IV and appear to be involved in spermatogonial and meiotic proliferation and in protein metabolism linked to cellular growth. This allows us to plan further experiments to better understand the functional implication of some of the genes that are found to be significantly regulated like CDC2, hematological and neurological expressed gene 1-like protein, HCDI protein, Mago Nashi, a BMP-like, and a steroid receptor binding protein.

Positive samples were further subjected to another nested PCR and conventional PCR to amplify the A. marginale groEL gene and the Ehrlichia dsbA gene, respectively. Selected A. marginale-positive samples were also subjected to nested PCR targeting the msp5 gene. Regardless of the animal host, the overall prevalence in blood samples obtained was 51.9% for Anaplasmataceae, 43% for A. marginale, and 1.1% for Ehrlichia. No water buffalo were positive for Ehrlichia. Meanwhile, 15.9, 6.7, and 2% of the tick samples, all morphologically identified as Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, were positive for Anaplasmataceae, A. marginale, and Ehrlichia, respectively. Sequence analysis of selected A. marginale msp5 amplicons showed that the isolates from the region share 94-98% identity to reported A. marginale from other countries. The phylogenetic tree showed clustering of isolates in the region and a close relationship with A. marginale isolates from other countries. Sequences of Ehrlichia amplicons from cattle and ticks were 97-100% similar to reported Ehrlichia minasensis isolates. This study showed the high prevalence of A. marginale in Luzon, Philippines, and provided the first molecular evidence of E. minasensis in the country."

DNA-protein complexes, known as nucleosomes, are formed when the DNA winds itself around the surface of the histones. The methylation of histone residues by enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) maintains gene repression over successive cell generations. Overexpression of EZH2 can silence important tumor suppressor genes leading to increased invasiveness of many types of cancers. This makes the inhibition of EZH2 an important target in the development of cancer therapeutics. We employed a three-stage computational de novo peptide design method to design inhibitory peptides of EZH2. The method consists of a sequence selection stage and two validation stages for fold specificity and approximate binding affinity. The sequence selection stage consists of an integer linear optimization model that was solved to produce a rank-ordered list of amino acid sequences with increased stability in the bound peptide-EZH2 structure. These sequences were validated through the calculation of the fold specificity and approximate binding affinity of the designed peptides. Here we report the discovery of novel EZH2 inhibitory peptides using the de novo peptide design method. The computationally discovered peptides were experimentally validated in vitro using dose titrations and mechanism of action enzymatic assays. The peptide with the highest in vitro response, SQ037, was validated in nucleo using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics. This peptide had an IC50 of 13.5 [Formula: see text]M, demonstrated greater potency as an inhibitor when compared to the native and K27A mutant control peptides, and demonstrated competitive inhibition versus the peptide substrate. Additionally, this peptide demonstrated high specificity to the EZH2 target in comparison to other histone methyltransferases. The validated peptides are the first computationally designed peptides that directly inhibit EZH2. These inhibitors should prove useful for further chromatin biology investigations."

They are obligate biotrophs, which extract nutrients only from living plant tissues and cannot grow apart from their hosts. Their lifestyle has slowed the dissection of molecular mechanisms underlying host invasion and avoidance or suppression of plant innate immunity. We sequenced the 101-Mb genome of Melampsora larici-populina, the causal agent of poplar leaf rust, and the 89-Mb genome of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal agent of wheat and barley stem rust. We then compared the 16,399 predicted proteins of M. larici-populina with the 17,773 predicted proteins of P. graminis f. sp tritici. Genomic features related to their obligate biotrophic lifestyle include expanded lineage-specific gene families, a large repertoire of effector-like small secreted proteins, impaired nitrogen and sulfur assimilation pathways, and expanded families of amino acid and oligopeptide membrane transporters. The dramatic up-regulation of transcripts coding for small secreted proteins, secreted hydrolytic enzymes, and transporters in planta suggests that they play a role in host infection and nutrient acquisition. Some of these genomic hallmarks are mirrored in the genomes of other microbial eukaryotes that have independently evolved to infect plants, indicating convergent adaptation to a biotrophic existence inside plant cells."

To further survey these proteins in plants and to identify plant developmental processes with which the Mago-Y14 heterodimer is associated, we used the TcMago-TcY14 heterodimer as the bait protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen and searched for its binding partners in a cDNA library from a 3-year-old Taiwania (Taiwania cryptomerioides Hayata) seedling. We found three clones, an unknown protein (Tc61), a pectin methylesterase-like protein (Tc62) and a TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat)-like protein (Tc72). The Tc61 protein interacted strongly with the TcMago-TcY14 heterodimer, and its transcript was expressed in stems and leaves of 3-year-old Taiwania seedlings and in microsporangiate and ovulate cones. The pectin methylesterase-like protein was expressed abundantly in the roots of 3-year-old Taiwania seedlings and in pollinated ovulate cones, indicating that binding with the TcMago-TcY14 heterodimer may be involved in root development and growth of pollen tubes during pollination. The Tc72 protein encoded a complete TPR-like protein that is highly conserved among plants, with 10 alpha-helices and three conserved TPR motifs containing five consensus residues necessary for stable inter-helix packing. A tissue expression assay and light/dark treatments showed that the Tc72 gene was expressed abundantly in the leaves of seedlings and was sensitive to light and dark, as are the Tcmago and TcY14 genes, implying that the TcMago-TcY14 heterodimer interaction with Tc72 may be related to chloroplast protein transport."

They confer resistance against a broad spectrum of field isolates of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, including the Ug99 lineage, and are homologs of the barley powdery mildew-resistance protein MLA10. Here, we show that, similarly to MLA10, the Sr33 and Sr50 CC domains are sufficient to induce cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana Autoactive CC domains and full-length Sr33 and Sr50 proteins self-associate in planta In contrast, truncated CC domains equivalent in size to an MLA10 fragment for which a crystal structure was previously determined fail to induce cell death and do not self-associate. Mutations in the truncated region also abolish self-association and cell-death signaling. Analysis of Sr33 and Sr50 CC domains fused to YFP and either nuclear localization or nuclear export signals in N benthamiana showed that cell-death induction occurs in the cytosol. In stable transgenic wheat plants, full-length Sr33 proteins targeted to the cytosol provided rust resistance, whereas nuclear-targeted Sr33 was not functional. These data are consistent with CC-mediated induction of both cell-death signaling and stem rust resistance in the cytosolic compartment, whereas previous research had suggested that MLA10-mediated cell-death and disease resistance signaling occur independently, in the cytosol and nucleus, respectively."

Lineage tracing studies have previously disclosed the morphologic features of gastric epithelial lineage progenitors (GEPs), including those of the presumptive multipotent stem cell. However, their molecular features have not been defined. Here, we present the results of an analysis of genes and pathways expressed in these cells. One hundred forty-seven transcripts enriched in GEPs were identified using an approach that did not require physical disruption of the stem cell niche. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR studies of laser capture microdissected cells retrieved from this niche confirmed enriched expression of a selected set of genes from the GEP list. An algorithm that allows quantitative comparisons of the functional relatedness of automatically annotated expression profiles showed that the GEP profile is similar to a dataset of genes that defines mouse hematopoietic stem cells, and distinct from the profiles of two differentiated GEP descendant lineages (parietal and zymogenic cell). Overall, our analysis revealed that growth factor response pathways are prominent in GEPs, with insulin-like growth factor appearing to play a key role. A substantial fraction of GEP transcripts encode products required for mRNA processing and cytoplasmic localization, including numerous homologs of Drosophila genes (e.g., Y14, staufen, mago nashi) needed for axis formation during oogenesis. mRNA targeting proteins may help these epithelial progenitors establish differential communications with neighboring cells in their niche."

In addition, Sr2 is linked with a brown coloration of ears and stems, termed pseudo-black chaff (PBC). PBC, initially believed to be elicited by stem rust infection, was subsequently recognized to occur in the absence of pathogen infection. The current study demonstrates that the resistance response to stem rust is associated with the death of photosynthetic cells around rust infection sites in the inoculated leaf sheath. Similarly, Sr2-dependent resistance to powdery mildew was associated with the death of leaf mesophyll cells around mildew infection sites. We demonstrate that PBC occurring in the absence of pathogen inoculation also corresponds with death and the collapse of photosynthetic cells in the affected parts of stems and ears. In addition, Sr2-dependent necrosis was inducible in leaves by application of petroleum jelly or by heat treatments. Thus, Sr2 was found to be associated with cell death, which could be triggered by either biotic or abiotic stresses. Our results suggest a role for the Sr2 locus in controlling cell death in response to stress."

The nuclear shuttling proteins Y14/Tsunagi and Mago nashi are required for oskar mRNA localization, and they co-localize with oskar mRNA at the posterior pole of the oocyte. Their human homologues, Y14/RBM8 and Magoh, are core components of the exon-exon junction complex (EJC). The EJC is deposited on mRNAs in a splicing-dependent manner, 20-24 nucleotides upstream of exon-exon junctions, independently of the RNA sequence. This indicates a possible role of splicing in oskar mRNA localization, challenging the established notion that the oskar 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) is sufficient for this process. Here we show that splicing at the first exon-exon junction of oskar RNA is essential for oskar mRNA localization at the posterior pole. We revisit the issue of sufficiency of the oskar 3'UTR for posterior localization and show that the localization of unrelated transcripts bearing the oskar 3'UTR is mediated by endogenous oskar mRNA. Our results reveal an important new function for splicing: regulation of messenger ribonucleoprotein complex assembly and organization for mRNA cytoplasmic localization."

Inheritance accounts for 60% of these cases, of which 70% are nonsyndromic. The most common cause of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) is mutation in GJB2, a gene on chromosome 13, which encodes a gap junction protein named Connexin 26. Mutations in GJB2 are responsible for 40% of genetic childhood deafness. The most common mutation, 35delG, predominates in many ethnic groups. Some families with linkage to the DFNB1 locus have none or only one mutated allele in GJB2, however, some subjects can exhibit a large deletion in another connexin gene, GJB6, resulting in a monogenic or digenic pattern of inheritance in this complex DFNB1 locus that contains both genes (GJB2 and GJB6).

Pm8 is a powdery mildew resistance gene on 1RS which, after widespread agricultural cultivation, is now widely overcome by adapted mildew races. Here we show by homology-based cloning and subsequent physical and genetic mapping that Pm8 is the rye orthologue of the Pm3 allelic series of mildew resistance genes in wheat. The cloned gene was functionally validated as Pm8 by transient, single-cell expression analysis and stable transformation. Sequence analysis revealed a complex mosaic of ancient haplotypes among Pm3- and Pm8-like genes from different members of the Triticeae. These results show that the two genes have evolved independently after the divergence of the species 7.5 million years ago and kept their function in mildew resistance. During this long time span the co-evolving pathogens have not overcome these genes, which is in strong contrast to the breakdown of Pm8 resistance since its introduction into commercial wheat 70 years ago. Sequence comparison revealed that evolutionary pressure acted on the same subdomains and sequence features of the two orthologous genes. This suggests that they recognize directly or indirectly the same pathogen effectors that have been conserved in the powdery mildews of wheat and rye."

The DEAD-box protein eIF4AIII encloses an ATP molecule and provides the binding sites for six ribonucleotides. Btz wraps around eIF4AIII and stacks against the 5' nucleotide. An intertwined network of interactions anchors Mago-Y14 and Btz at the interface between the two domains of eIF4AIII, effectively stabilizing the ATP bound state.

The mechanisms of their interactions and the biological indications of these interactions are still poorly understood in plants. A new mutation, hap1-2. leads to premature pollen death and a reduced seed production in Arabidopsis. This mutation introduces a viable truncated transcript AtMagoΔC. This truncation abolishes the interaction between AtMago and AtY14 in vitro, but not the interaction between AtMago and AteIF4AIII. In addition to a strong nuclear presence of AtMago, both AtMago and AtMagoΔC exhibit processing-body (P-body) localization.

Physiological and phenotypic responses of maize to photoperiod have widely been investigated based on multi-site field observations; however, proteome-based responsive mechanisms under controlled photoperiod regimes, nutrient and moisture soils are not yet well understood. In the present study, we sequenced and analyzed six proteomes of tropically-adapted and photoperiod-sensitive M9 inbred line at the vegetative 3 stage and proteomes from tropically-adapted and photoperiod-sensitive Shuang M9 (SM9) inbred line at the vegetative-tasseling stage. All plants were grown in growth chambers with controlled soil and temperature and three photoperiod regimes, a short photoperiod (SP) of 10 h light/14 h dark, a control neutral photoperiod (NP) of 12 h light/12 h dark, and a long photoperiod (LP) of 16 h light/8 h dark for a daily cycle. We identified 4,395 proteins of which 401 and 425 differentially-expressed proteins (DPs) were found in abundance in M9 leaves and in SM9 leaves as per SP/LP vs. NP, respectively. Some DPs showed responses to both SP and LP while some only responded to either SP or LP, depending on M9 or SM9. Our study showed that the photoperiodic response pathway, circadian clock rhythm, and high light density/intensity crosstalk with each other, but apparently differ from dark signaling routes. Photoperiod response involves light-responsive or dark-responsive proteins or both. The DPs positioned on the signaling routes from photoperiod changes to RNA/DNA responses involve the mago nashi homolog and glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins. Moreover, the cell-to-cell movement of ZCN14 through plasmodesmata is likely blocked under a 16-h-light LP.

In vertebrates, splicing leads to deposition of exon junction complex (EJC) onto the mRNA, and then 3'UTR-bound EJCs trigger NMD. It is proposed that this intron-based NMD is vertebrate specific, and it evolved to eliminate the misproducts of alternative splicing.
