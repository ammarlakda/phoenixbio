How Twist1 regulates this expression remains unclear. Here, we report that Twist1 regulates Cullin2 (Cul2) circular RNA to increase expression of vimentin in EMT. Twist1 bound the Cul2 promoter to activate its transcription and to selectively promote expression of Cul2 circular RNA (circ-10720), but not mRNA. circ-10720 positively correlated with Twist1, tumor malignance, and poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Twist1 promoted vimentin expression by increasing levels of circ-10720, which can absorb miRNAs that target vimentin. circ-10720 knockdown counteracted the tumor-promoting activity of Twist1 in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft and diethylnitrosamine-induced TetOn-Twist1 transgenic mouse HCC models. These data unveil a mechanism by which Twist1 regulates vimentin during EMT. They also provide potential therapeutic targets for HCC treatment and provide new insight for circular RNA (circRNA)-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.Significance: A circRNA-based mechanism drives Twist1-mediated regulation of vimentin during EMT and provides potential therapeutic targets for treatment of HCC.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/15/4150/F1.large.jpg Cancer Res; 78(15); 4150-62. ©2018 AACR."

HIFalpha is a transcription factor that mediates the expression of hypoxia-sensitive genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which in turn regulates vasculogenesis. Whereas CUL2 participates in the degradation of HIFalpha, the potential role of CUL2 in the regulation of other cellular processes is less well established. In the present study, suppression of CUL2 expression by Cul2 siRNA inhibited HIFalpha transcriptional activation of the VEGF gene in vitro, indicating that CUL2 plays a role distinct from its known function in HIFalpha degradation. Because ARNT heterodimerizes with HIFalpha, we assessed whether CUL2 influenced ARNT expression. Cul2 siRNA inhibited the expression of endogenous ARNT. Ectopically expressed ARNT reversed the inhibition of HIF activity by Cul2 siRNA in the VEGF promoter, suggesting that CUL2 regulates HIF activation through ARNT. In 786-O cells lacking VHL, Cul2 siRNA suppressed the expression of both ARNT and VEGF, indicating that CUL2 regulates HIF activity independently of VHL. In transgenic zebrafish expressing GFP driven by the Flk promoter (a known HIF target), zCul2 morpholino blocked embryonic vasculogenesis in a manner similar to that caused by inhibition of VEGF-A. In the zebrafish embryos, zCul2 inhibited the expression of CUL2, VEGF, and Flk-GFP protein, indicating that CUL2 is required for expression of other vasculogenic HIF targets. Taken together, CUL2 is required for normal vasculogenesis, at least in part mediated by its regulation of HIF-mediated transcription."

However, the existence of further CC-RCC gatekeeper genes is implied by CC-RCC kindreds not linked to the VHL gene and the absence of somatic VHL inactivation in approximately 30% of sporadic CC-RCC. Genes that encode proteins which interact with the VHL gene product (VHL) provide candidate gatekeeper RCC genes. VHL forms a multimeric complex with two subunits (B and C) of the SIII (elongin) transcriptional elongation complex and CUL2, a member of the cullin family. Most pathogenic VHL mutations inhibit formation of the VHL/elonginB+C/CUL2 complex. A further VHL-binding protein of unknown function, VBP1, fails to bind to truncated forms of VHL. We have investigated the possible roles of CUL2 and VBP1 in renal tumorigenesis by analyzing sporadic RCC of known VHL mutation or hypermethylation status, including CC-RCC without VHL inactivation (n = 40); CC-RCC with VHL inactivation (n = 35); and non-CC-RCC (n = 14). No VBP1 mutations were identified in 89 sporadic RCCs, suggesting that VBP1 is not an RCC gatekeeper gene. To investigate CUL2, we mapped the CUL2 gene to chromosome band 10p11.1-p11.2, a region reported to show loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in several human cancers (including non-CC-RCC); determined the genomic organization; and performed mutation analysis of the 21 exons identified. Using novel intragenic polymorphisms, we detected LOH in 6/25 informative RCCs; however, no pathogenic CUL2 mutations were identified in the 89 RCCs analyzed. These findings suggest that unless CUL2 is inactivated by epigenetic events, it is not a major RCC TSG. However, CUL2 remains a candidate TSG for other tumor types demonstrating 10p LOH.

Recently, a putative tumor suppressor gene has been identified, CUL2, whose product has been shown to interact with the VHL tumor suppressor. To examine whether CUL2 plays a role in pheochromocytoma pathogenesis, we analyzed a series of 26 distinct tumor samples for mutations in the whole coding region of this gene. There were no somatic pathogenic mutations in CUL2, except for 1 sporadic tumor that had a hemizygous gene deletion. We also found 3 novel polymorphisms in the gene. One of these variants, IVS5-6C/T, as well as another previously described one, c.2057G/A, were overrepresented among the pheochromocytoma patients compared to that in a control population (P < 0.005 and P < 0.01, respectively). Although our findings suggest that CUL2 does not play a major role in the pathogenesis of pheochromocytomas, it is still unknown whether epigenetic mechanisms are involved in its inactivation in VHL-associated tumors. Furthermore, the potential role for the overrepresented alleles in the pheochromocytoma group requires further investigation."

Here, we demonstrated that CUL2 was specifically overexpressed in HPV16 positive cervical cancer cells and tissues, and CUL2 expression was significantly increased along with the cervical lesion progression and positively correlated with HPV16 E7. CUL2 knockdown slowed the growth of xenograft tumors in mouse models. Importantly, CUL2 specifically bound to HPV16 E7, but not HPV18 E7. Moreover, CUL2 acted as a direct target of miR-424, and reversely suppressed miR-424; E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) suppressed miR-424 expression; CUL2 bound to E2F1 and promoted E2F1 expression. Our results indicate the existence of a regulatory loop among CUL2, E2F1, and miR-424 in HPV16 positive cervical cancer cells. Our results suggest that E7 recruited CUL2, driven by CUL2/E2F1/miR-424 regulatory loop, is overexpressed and accelerates HPV16-induced cervical carcinogenesis.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) represents the most prevalent methylation modification of lncRNAs and has been shown to play important roles in the pathophysiological processes of tumors. However, the distribution and function of m6A modifications in lncRNAs in GBM tissues have not been fully revealed. Methods: The global depiction of m6A-modified lncRNA expression patterns in GBM tumor tissues was screened via m6A high-throughput sequencing. Gain- and loss-of-function assays were performed to investigate the role of WEE2-AS1 in GBM. Mass spectrometry and RNA-pulldown, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), luciferase reporter and coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed to explore the mechanism of m6A-mediated upregulation of WEE2-AS1 expression and the downstream mechanism promoting the malignant progression of GBM. Results: Herein, we report the differential expression profile of m6A-modified lncRNAs in human GBM tissues for the first time. WEE2-AS1 was identified as a novel m6A-modified lncRNA that promotes GBM progression and was post-transcriptionally stabilized by IGF2BP3, an m6A reader. Moreover, we confirmed that WEE2-AS1 promoted RPN2 protein stabilization by preventing CUL2-mediated RPN2 K322 ubiquitination, thereby contributing to GBM malignant progression by activating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. In translational medicine, we found that blocking WEE2-AS1 expression improved the therapeutic sensitivity of dasatinib, a central nervous system penetrant that is FDA-approved in GBM. Conclusions: Overall, this work highlights that WEE2-AS1 may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in GBM, the knockdown of which significantly improves the efficacy of dasatinib, providing a promising strategy for improving targeted combination therapy for GBM patients."

Our study aimed to investigate potential myopia-associated non-coding RNAs and related molecules by performing a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of miRNA expression profile of mice with form-deprivation myopia (FDM). Differentially expressed miRNAs in two raw microarray data sets (GSE58124 and GSE84220) from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were comprehensively analysed using GEO2R. Target genes were predicted using miRDB and enriched with Metascape online tool. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed utilizing STRING and Cytoscape. Significant differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using RNA extracted from monocular FDM ocular tissues. As result, we identified three upregulated miRNAs (mmu-miR-1936, mmu-miR-338-5p, and mmu-miR-673-3p) significantly associated with myopia in the two microarray data sets (p < 0.05 and |Log (Fold Change) |>1). GO functional analysis suggested these three miRNAs were targeted in genes mostly enriched in morphogenesis and developmental growth of retinal tissues. Enrichment analysis revealed top eight transcription factors, including PAX6 and Smad3, related to myopia. Ten hub genes, including Rbx1, Fbxl3, Fbxo27, Fbxl7, Fbxo4, Cul3, Cul2, Klhl5, Fbxl16 and Klhl42, associated with ubiquitin conjugation were identified. qRT-PCR confirmed the increased expression of mmu-miR-1936 and mmu-miR-338-5p (p < 0.05), but no statistical difference was observed in mmu-miR-673-3p expression in myopic retinas. Our findings indicated mmu-miR-1936, mmu-miR-338-5p and mmu-miR-673-3p upregulation may be associated with myopia development via post-transcriptional gene regulation, and identified potential molecules that could be further explored in future studies of the mechanism in myopia."

In barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), vegetative AXM develop in the crown and give rise to modified branches, referred to as tillers. Mutations in the barley low-tillering mutant uniculm2 block vegetative AXM development and prevent tiller development. The objectives of this work were to examine gene expression in wild-type and cul2 mutant plants, fine map the CUL2 gene, and to examine synteny in the CUL2 region in barley with rice. RNA profiling experiments using two near-isogenic line pairs carrying either the cul2 mutant allele or wild-type CUL2 allele in different genetic backgrounds detected 28 unique gene transcripts exhibiting similar patterns of differential accumulation in both genetic backgrounds, indicating that we have identified key genes impacted by the CUL2 gene. Twenty-four genes had higher abundance in uniculm2 mutant tissues, and nearly half of the annotated genes likely function in stress-response or signal transduction pathways. Genetic mapping identified five co-segregating markers in 1,088 F2 individuals. These markers spanned the centromere region on chromosome 6H, and coincided with a 50-cM region on rice chromosome 2, indicating that it may be difficult to positionally clone CUL2. Taken together, the results revealed stress response and signal transduction pathways that are associated with the CUL2 gene, isolating CUL2 via positional cloning approaches that may be difficult, and the remnants of barley-rice synteny in the CUL2 region."

The aim of the study was to investigate the function and mechanism of LINC00997 in CC. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) revealed that LINC00997 RNA expression was also increased in CC cells and LINC00997 copy number was upregulated in CC tissues. 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), colony formation, and Transwell assays as well as transmission electron microscopy observation exhibited that LINC00997 depletion inhibited CC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and autophagy. The relationship between LINC00997 and its downstream genes was confirmed by RNA pulldown, luciferase reporter, and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation assays. Mechanistically, LINC00997 upregulated the expression of cullin 2 (CUL2) by interacting with microRNA 574-3p (miR-574-3p). Moreover, Western blot analysis was employed to detect the protein levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway-associated factors in CC cells.

Plants carrying the recessive uniculm2 (cul2) mutation initiate vegetative axillary meristem development but fail to develop tillers. In addition, inflorescence axillary meristems develop into spikelets, but the spikelets at the distal end of the inflorescence have an altered phyllotaxy and are sometimes absent. Double mutant combinations of cul2 and nine other recessive mutations that exhibit low to high tiller number phenotypes resulted in a uniculm vegetative phenotype. One exception was the occasional multiple shoots produced in combination with granum-a; a high tillering mutant that occasionally produces two shoot apical meristems. These results show that the CUL2 gene product plays a role in the development of axillary meristems into tillers but does not regulate the development of vegetative apical meristems. Moreover, novel double-mutant inflorescence phenotypes were observed with cul2 in combination with the other mutants. These data show that the wild-type CUL2 gene product is involved in controlling proper inflorescence development and that it functions in combination with some of the other genes that affect branching.

VHL disease is caused by germline mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 3p25. Tumor development in this setting is due to inactivation or loss of the remaining wild-type allele in a susceptible cell. The highly vascular nature of VHL-associated neoplasms can be understood in light of the recent finding that the VHL gene product (pVHL) inhibits the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs, such as the mRNA encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), under normoxic conditions. This property of pVHL appears to be linked to its ability to bind to complexes containing elongin B, elongin C, and cullin 2 (Cul2). Elongin C and Cul2, based on their homology with Skp1 and Cdc53, respectively, are suspected of targeting certain proteins for covalent modification with ubiquitin and hence for degradation. One model, which remains to be tested, is that the binding of pVHL to elongins B/C and Cul2 affects the ubiquitination of RNA-binding proteins that regulate the stability of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs."

Through purification and characterization of a larger collection of BC-box proteins that serve as substrate recognition subunits of Cul2 and Cul5 ubiquitin ligases and through structure-function studies, we define Cul2- and Cul5-boxes in greater detail. Although it previously appeared that there was little sequence similarity between Cul5- and Cul2-box motifs, analyses of newly identified BC-box proteins reveal that residues conserved in the Cul2-box represent a subset of those conserved in the Cul5-box. The sequence motif LPPhiP, which is conserved in most Cul5-boxes and has been suggested to specify assembly of Cul5 ligases, is compatible with Cul2 interaction. Finally, the spacing between BC- and Cullin-boxes is much more flexible than has been appreciated and can vary from as few as 3 and as many as approximately 80 amino acids.

Here, we investigated the functional role of NLRC5 in the infection of a flavivirus, dengue virus (DENV). We found that the expression of NLRC5 was strongly induced by virus infection and IFNB or IFNG stimulation in different cell lines. Overexpression of NLRC5 remarkably suppressed DENV infection, whereas knockout of NLRC5 led to a significant increase in DENV infection. Mechanistic study revealed that NLRC5 interacted with the viral nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) protease domain and mediated degradation of NS3 through a ubiquitin-dependent selective macroautophagy/autophagy pathway. We demonstrated that NLRC5 recruited the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL2 (cullin 2) to catalyze K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of the NS3 protease domain, which subsequently served as a recognition signal for cargo receptor TOLLIP-mediated selective autophagic degradation. Together, we have demonstrated that NLRC5 exerted an antiviral effect by mediating the degradation of a multifunctional protein of DENV, providing a novel antiviral signal axis of NLRC5-CUL2-NS3-TOLLIP. This study expands our understanding of the regulatory network of NLRC5 in the host defense against virus infection."

SOCS-box proteins recruit substrates to the ECS complex and are linked to Cullin-Rbx via Elongin B/C. VHL has been implicated as a SOCS-box protein, but lacks a C-terminal sequence (downstream of the BC box) of the SOCS box. We now show that VHL specifically interacts with endogenous Cul2-Rbx1 in mammalian cells, whereas SOCS-box proteins associate with Cul5-Rbx2. We also identify LRR-1 and FEM1B as proteins that share a region of homology with VHL (the VHL box, including the BC box and downstream residues) and associate with Cul2-Rbx1. ECS complexes can thus be classified into two distinct protein assemblies, that is, those that contain a subunit with a VHL box (composed of the BC box and a downstream Cul2 box) that interacts with Cul2-Rbx1, and those that contain a subunit with a SOCS box (BC box and downstream Cul5 box) that interacts with Cul5-Rbx2. Domain-swapping analyses showed that the specificity of interaction of VHL-box and SOCS-box proteins with Cullin-Rbx modules is determined by the Cul2 and Cul5 boxes, respectively. Finally, RNAi-mediated knockdown of the Cul2-Rbx1 inhibited the VHL-mediated degradation of HIF-2alpha, whereas knockdown of Cul5-Rbx2 did not affect it. These data suggest that the functions of the Cul2-Rbx1 and Cul5-Rbx2 modules are distinct."

It has been well-known that the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling released by the niche cells promotes the maintenance of germline stem cells (GSCs) through inhibiting the transcription of the bag-of-marbles (bam) gene, which encodes a key factor for GSC differentiation. However, whether Bam is regulated at the post-translational level remains largely unknown. Here we show that the E3 ligase Cullin-2 (Cul2) is involved in modulating Bam ubiquitination, which occurs probably at multiple lysine residues of Bam's C-terminal region. Genetic evidence further supports the notion that Cul2-mediated Bam ubiquitination and turnover are essential for GSC maintenance and proper germline development. Collectively, our data not only uncovers a novel regulatory mechanism by which Bam is controlled at the post-translational level, but also provides new insights into how Cullin family protein determines the differentiation fate of early germ cells."

Interactions between HPV E7 and host cell proteins can also drive cancer progression. We hypothesize that HPV E7-host protein interactions specific for high-risk E7 contribute to the carcinogenic activity of high-risk HPV. The cellular protein ZER1 interacts with the E7 protein from HPV16, the genotype most frequently associated with human cancers. The HPV16 E7-ZER1 interaction is unique among HPV E7 tested to date. Other E7 proteins, even from closely related HPV genotypes, do not bind ZER1, which is a substrate specificity factor for a CUL2-RING ubiquitin ligase. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of ZER1 to the carcinogenic activity of HPV16 E7. First, we mapped the ZER1 binding site to specific residues on the C terminus of HPV16 E7. We showed that the mutant HPV16 E7 that cannot bind ZER1 is impaired in the ability to promote the growth of primary keratinocytes. We found that ZER1 and CUL2 contribute to, but are not required for, HPV16 E7 to degrade RB1. Cancer dependency data show that ZER1 is an essential gene in most HPV-positive, but not HPV-negative, cancer cell lines. Depleting ZER1 impaired the growth of primary keratinocytes expressing HPV16 E7 or HPV18 E7 and of HPV16-and HPV18-positive cervical cancer cell lines. Taken together, our work demonstrates that ZER1 contributes to HPV-mediated carcinogenesis and is essential for the growth of HPV-positive cells. IMPORTANCE HPV16 is highly carcinogenic and is the most predominant HPV genotype associated with human cancers. The mechanisms that underlie differences between high-risk HPV genotypes are currently unknown, but many of these differences are likely attributable to the activities of the oncogenic HPV proteins, including E7. The HPV E7 oncoprotein is essential for HPV-mediated carcinogenesis. A large number of HPV E7 targets have been identified. However, it is unclear which of these many interactions contributes to the carcinogenic activity of HPV E7. Here, we characterized the interaction between HPV16 E7 and the host cell protein ZER1, testing whether this genotype-specific interaction could enable some of the carcinogenic activity of HPV16 E7. We found that ZER1 binding contributes to the growth-promoting activity of HPV16 E7 and to the growth of HPV-positive cervical cancer cells. We propose that ZER1 makes an important contribution to HPV-mediated carcinogenesis."

Genetic predisposition to clear cell RCC (CCRCC) is a major feature of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease (MIM 193300) and has rarely been associated with chromosome 3 translocations. In addition, familial papillary (non-clear cell) RCC may result from germline mutations in the MET proto-oncogene (MIM 164860). However, rare kindreds with familial CCRCC (FCRC) not linked to the VHL tumour suppressor gene have been described suggesting that further familial RCC susceptibility genes exist. To investigate the genetic epidemiology of FCRC, we undertook a clinical and molecular study of FCRC in nine kindreds with two or more cases of CCRCC in first degree relatives. FCRC was characterised by an earlier age at onset (mean 47.1 years, 52% of cases <50 years of age) than sporadic cases. These findings differ from the only previous report of two FCRC kindreds and have important implications for renal surveillance in FCRC. The molecular basis of CCRCC susceptibility was investigated in nine FCRC kindreds and seven isolated cases with features of possible genetic susceptibility to CCRCC (four bilateral CCRCC aged <50 years and three with unilateral CCRCC aged <30 years). No germline mutations were detected in the VHL or MET genes, suggesting that FCRC is not allelic with VHL disease or HPRC. As binding of the VHL gene product to the CUL2 protein is important for pVHL function, we then searched for germline CUL2 mutations. Although CUL2 polymorphisms were identified, no pathogenic mutations were detected. These findings further define the clinical features of FCRC and exclude a major role for mutations in VHL, MET, or CUL2 in this disorder."

Rbx1/ROC1/Hrt1, a RING finger protein, functions as an important component of the cullin-containing SCF and VBC-Cul2 ligases. Modification of cullins by NEDD8 (NEDDylation), has been shown to be essential for the E3 activity of both SCF and VBC-Cul2, and it was suggested that Rbx1 acts as the E3 for cullin NEDDylation. RING finger is composed of eight cysteine and histidine residues that bind to zinc ions. Rbx1 is a highly evolutionarily conserved protein; however, the eighth coordination residue in its RING finger is aspartate (D97) rather than cysteine. Substitution of D97 with each of the other 19 amino acids demonstrates that aspartate is superior to cysteine in cullin NEDDylation. Interestingly, however, different D97 mutants demonstrate different activities towards 6 cullins tested. Importantly, we were able to discriminate between the NEDDylating activity of Rbx1 and its involvement in the ubiquitylation reaction within the context of VBC-Cul2. Moreover, while Rbx1 is not involved in governing the stability of SCF, Rbx1 mutants destabilize VBC-Cul2. Taken together, these results indicate that various mechanisms regulate both the activities and the stability of cullin-based ligases."

Leveraging the catalytic nature of the ubiquitin-proteasome enzymatic machinery, TPD exhibits higher potency to eliminate disease-causing target proteins such as oncogenic transcription factors that may otherwise be difficult to abrogate by conventional inhibitors. However, there are challenges that remain. Currently, nearly all degraders engage CUL4CRBN or CUL2VHL as the E3 ligase for target ubiquitination. While their immediate efficacies are evident, the narrowed E3 ligase options make TPD vulnerable to potential drug resistance. In addition, E3 ligases show differential tissue expression and have intrinsic limitations in accessing varying types of disease-relevant targets. As the success of TPD is closely associated with the ability of E3 ligases to efficiently polyubiquitinate the target of interest, the long-term outlook of TPD drug development will depend on whether E3 ligases such as CUL4CRBN and CUL2VHL are accessible to the targets of interest.

Several lines of evidence now establish microRNAs (miRNAs), which are short noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression through posttranscriptional mechanisms, as key elements in this response to hypoxia. Oxygen deprivation induces a distinct shift in the expression of a specific group of miRNAs, termed hypoxamirs, and emerging evidence indicates that hypoxia regulates several facets of hypoxamir transcription, maturation, and function. Transcription factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor are upregulated under conditions of low oxygen availability and directly activate the transcription of a subset of hypoxamirs. Conversely, hypoxia selectively represses other hypoxamirs through less well characterized mechanisms. In addition, oxygen deprivation has been directly implicated in epigenetic modifications such as DNA demethylation that control specific miRNA transcription. Finally, hypoxia also modulates the activity of key proteins that control posttranscriptional events in the maturation and activity of miRNAs. Collectively, these findings establish hypoxia as an important proximal regulator of miRNA biogenesis and function. It will be important for future studies to address the relative contributions of transcriptional and posttranscriptional events in the regulation of specific hypoxamirs and how such miRNAs are coordinated in order to integrate into the complex hierarchical regulatory network induced by hypoxia."

Tumour development in this setting is due to loss or inactivation of the remaining wild-type VHL allele. The VHL gene product (pVHL) resides primarily in the cytoplasm. A frequently mutated region of pVHL can bind to complexes containing elongin B, elongin C and Cul2. Loss of pVHL leads to an inappropriate accumulation of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs, such as the mRNA encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), under normoxic conditions. This finding is most likely to account for the hypervascular nature of VHL-associated neoplasms. Current studies are focussed on understanding if and how binding to elongins and Cul2 is linked to the ability of pVHL to regulate hypoxia-inducible mRNAs. In this regard, it is perhaps noteworthy that elongin C and Cul2 are homologous to yeast proteins Skp1 and Cdc53. These latter proteins participate in the formation of complexes that target certain proteins for ubiquitination."

To investigate the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease tumor suppressor gene, we sequenced the VHL gene in seven primate species. Comparative analysis was performed for human, primate, and rodent VHL genes and for a putative Caenorhabditis elegans VHL homologue identified by database analysis. The VHL gene has two translation initiation sites (at codons 1 and 54); however, the relative importance of the full-length translation product (pVHL30) and that translated from the second internal translation initiation site (pVHL19) is unclear. The N-terminal sequence of pVHL30 contains eight copies of a GXEEX acidic repeat motif in human and higher primates, but only three copies were present in the marmoset, and only one copy was present in rodent VHL genes. Evolutionary analysis suggested that the N-terminal repetitive sequence in pVHL30 was of less functional importance than those regions present in both pVHL30 and pVHL19. The VHL gene product is reported to form complexes with various proteins including elongin B, elongin C, VBP-1, fibronectin, Spl, CUL2, and HIF-1. Although most of the regions in pVHL that had been implicated in binding specific proteins demonstrated evolutionary conservation, the carboxy-terminal putative VBP-1 binding site was less well conserved, suggesting that VBP-1 binding may have less functional significance. Although an amino acid substitution (K171T) close to the pVHL elongin binding region was found in baboon, analysis of the structure of human pVHL suggested that this substitution would not interfere with pVHL/elongin C interaction. In general, there was a good correlation between the pVHL domains that demonstrated most evolutionary conservation and those that were most frequently mutated in tumors. Analysis of human/C. elegans conservation and human germline and somatic mutation patterns identified a highly conserved mutation cluster region between codons 74 and 90. However, this region is likely to be important for the structural integrity of pVHL rather than representing an additional protein binding domain."

While most are assembled with Cul5, a few utilize Cul2. BC-box motifs enable all these E4orf6 proteins to assemble ligase complexes with Elongins B and C. We also identified a Cul2-box motif used for Cul2 selection in all Cul2-based complexes. With this information, we set out to determine if other adenoviruses also possess the ability to form the ligase complex and, if so, to predict their Cullin usage. Here we report that all adenoviruses known to encode an E4orf6-like protein (mastadenoviruses and atadenoviruses) maintain the potential to form the ligase complex. We could accurately predict Cullin usage for E4orf6 products of mastadenoviruses and all but one atadenovirus. Interestingly, in nonhuman primate adenoviruses, we found a clear segregation of Cullin binding, with Cul5 utilized by viruses infecting great apes and Cul2 by Old/New World monkey viruses, suggesting that a switch from Cul2 to Cul5 binding occurred during the period when great apes diverged from monkeys. Based on the analysis of Cullin selection, we also suggest that the majority of human adenoviruses, which exhibit a broader tropism for the eye and the respiratory tract, exhibit Cul5 specificity and resemble viruses infecting great apes, whereas those that infect the gastrointestinal tract may have originated from monkey viruses that share Cul2 specificity. Finally, aviadenoviruses also appear to contain E4orf6 genes that encode proteins with a conserved XCXC motif followed by, in most cases, a BC-box motif."

We aimed to investigate if large OSCC tumors show different cell cycle gene transcriptional signature compared to small tumors. Seventeen fresh OSCC tumor samples with different tumor sizes (T) were included in the study. Tumors were from the tongue or from the floor of the mouth, and only three patients were nonsmokers. Samples were categorized according to clinical tumor size in tumors ≤2 cm (T1, n = 5) or tumors >2 cm (T2, n = 9; T3, n = 2; T4, n = 1). The group of tumors ≤2 cm was considered the reference group, while the larger tumors were considered the test group. We assessed the expression of 84 cell cycle genes by qRT-PCR array and normalized it to the expression of two housekeeping genes. Results were analyzed according to the formula 2(^-DeltaCt). A five-fold change cutoff was used, and p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Ki-67 immunohistochemistry was performed to estimate cell proliferation index. Twenty-nine genes were downregulated in the test group (larger tumors) compared to the reference group (smaller tumors). Among these genes, 13 reached statistical significance: ANAPC4, CUL1, SUMO1, KPNA2, MAD2L2, CCNG2, E2F4, NBN, CUL2, PCNA, TFDP1, KNTC1, and ATR. Ki-67 labeling index was similar in both tumor groups. Our findings suggest that the transcriptional activity of specific cell cycle genes varies according to the size of OSCC tumor, which probably reflects tumor molecular evolution and adaptation to the microenvironment."

Map-based cloning revealed that both mutants are due to allelic mutations in the CsPHB gene, a homolog of the Arabidopsis PHABULOSA which encodes a class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP III) transcription factor. Leaf rolling is an important agronomic trait in crop breeding. Moderate leaf rolling minimizes shadowing between leaves, leading to improved photosynthetic efficiency. Although a number of genes controlling rolled leaf have been identified from rice and other plant species, none have been mapped or cloned in cucurbit crops. In this study, we identified and characterized two curly leaf (cul) mutants, cul-1 and cul-2 in cucumber. With map-based cloning, we show that cul-1 and cul-2 are allelic mutations and CsPHB (Csa6G525430) was the candidate gene for both mutants. The CsPHB gene encoded a class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP III) transcription factor. A single non-synonymous mutation in the fourth and fifth exons of the CsPHB was responsible for the cul-1 and cul-2 mutant phenotypes, respectively. The single-nucleotide substitutions in cul-1 and cul-2 were both located in cs-miRNA165/166 complementary sites of CsPHB. The expression level of CsPHB gene in multiple organs of cul-1 and cul-2 mutants was higher than that in the wild type, while the expression of cs-miRNA165/166 in the two genotypes showed the opposite trend. We speculate that disruption of the binding between the mutant allele of CsPHB and cs-miRNA165/166 leads to the curly-leaf phenotype. This is the first report to clone and characterize the CsPHB gene in the family Cucurbitaceae. Taken together, these results support CsPHB as an important player in the modulation of leaf shape development in cucumber."

Here, we recruit 32 Tibetan elite alpinists (TEAs), who have successfully mounted Everest (8848 m) at least five times. Blood samples and physiological phenotypes of TEAs and 32 matched non-alpinist Tibetan volunteers (non-TEAs) are collected for analysis. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis identifies 23,202 differentially methylated CpGs (Padj < 0.05, |β| > 0.1) between the two groups. Some differentially methylated CpGs are in hypoxia-related genes such as PPP1R13L, MAP3K7CL, SEPTI-9, and CUL2. In addition, Gene ontology enrichment analysis reveals several inflammation-related pathways. Phenotypic analysis indicates that 12 phenotypes are significantly different between the two groups. In particular, TEAs exhibit higher blood oxygen saturation levels and lower neutrophil count, platelet count, and heart rate. For DNA methylation association analysis, we find that two CpGs (cg16687447, cg06947206) upstream of PTEN were associated with platelet count. In conclusion, extreme hypoxia exposure leads to epigenetic modifications and phenotypic alterations of TEA, providing us clues for exploring the molecular mechanism underlying changes under extreme hypoxia conditions."

Genetically, ccRCC originates from sequential losses of multiple tumor suppressor genes. Remarkably, chromosome 3p loss occurs in more than 90% of sporadic ccRCCs. This results in concurrent one-copy loss of four tumor suppressor genes that are also mutated individually at high frequency in ccRCC (ie, VHL, 80%; PBRM1, 29% to 46%; BAP1, 6% to 19%; and SETD2, 8% to 30%). Pathogenically, 3p loss probably represents the first genetic event that occurs in sporadic ccRCC and the second genetic event in VHL-mutated hereditary ccRCC. VHL constitutes the substrate recognition module of the VCB-Cul2 E3 ligase that degrades HIF1/2α, whereas PBRM1, BAP1, and SETD2 are epigenetic modulators that regulate gene transcription. Because 3p loss and VHL inactivation are nearly universal truncal events in ccRCC, the resulting HIF1/2 signaling overdrive and accompanied tumor hypervascularization probably underlie the therapeutic benefits observed with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors, including sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib, bevacizumab, cabozantinib, and lenvatinib. Furthermore, recent marked advances in ccRCC genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, molecular mechanisms, mouse models, prognostic and predictive biomarkers, and clinical trials have rendered invaluable translational insights concerning precision kidney cancer therapeutics.

Here, we identified Cullin 2 and USP2 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase-2) as novel regulators of antithrombin expression that act by modulating antithrombin ubiquitination. Inhibition of the proteasome caused accumulation of antithrombin and its ubiquitinated forms in HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells. Notably, inhibition of neddylation with MLN4924 suppressed both ubiquitination and degradation of antithrombin, which is recapitulated by silencing of the neddylation enzymes, NAE1, UBA3, and UBE2M, with small interfering RNA (siRNA). We identified Cullin 2 as the interaction partner of antithrombin, and siRNA-mediated Cullin 2 knockdown reduced antithrombin ubiquitination and increased antithrombin protein. We further found that USP2 interacted with antithrombin and regulated antithrombin expression, showing that overexpression of USP2 inhibits the ubiquitination and proteasomal clearance of antithrombin, whereas pharmacological inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown of USP2 downregulates antithrombin.

The gene contains three exons with an open reading frame of 852 nucleotides, which encode a predicted protein of 284 amino acids. The VHL protein is believed to have several functions. It is involved in transcription regulation through its inhibition of elongation by binding to the B and C subunits of elongin. Mutations of VHL allow the B and C subunits to bind with the A subunit. This complex then overcomes ""pausing"" of RNA polymerase during mRNA transcription (2,3). Several studies suggest that the VHL protein is also involved in regulation of hypoxia-inducible transcripts, particularly vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), by altering mRNA stability (4,5). Therefore, VHL gene mutations permit the overexpression of VEGF under normoxic conditions, which leads to the angiogenesis believed to be required for tumor growth.

The barley (Hordeum vulgare) uniculm2 (cul2) mutation blocks axillary meristem development, and mutant plants lack lateral branches (tillers) that normally develop from the crown. A genetic screen for cul2 suppressors recovered two recessive alleles of ELIGULUM-A (ELI-A) that partially rescued the cul2 tillering phenotype. Mutations in ELI-A produce shorter plants with fewer tillers and disrupt the leaf blade-sheath boundary, producing liguleless leaves and reduced secondary cell wall development in stems and leaves. ELI-A is predicted to encode an unannotated protein containing an RNaseH-like domain that is conserved in land plants. ELI-A transcripts accumulate at the preligule boundary, the developing ligule, leaf margins, cells destined to develop secondary cell walls, and cells surrounding leaf vascular bundles. Recent studies have identified regulatory similarities between boundary development in leaves and lateral organs. Interestingly, we observed ELI-A transcripts at the preligule boundary, suggesting that ELI-A contributes to boundary formation between the blade and sheath. However, we did not observe ELI-A transcripts at the axillary meristem boundary in leaf axils, suggesting that ELI-A is not involved in boundary development for axillary meristem development.

Here we show that Pramel7 (PRAME-like 7), a protein highly expressed in the inner cell mass (ICM) but expressed at low levels in ESCs, targets for proteasomal degradation UHRF1, a key factor for DNA methylation maintenance. Increasing Pramel7 expression in serum-cultured ESCs promotes a preimplantation epiblast-like gene signature, reduces UHRF1 levels and causes global DNA hypomethylation. Pramel7 is required for blastocyst formation and its forced expression locks ESCs in pluripotency. Pramel7/UHRF1 expression is mutually exclusive in ICMs whereas Pramel7-knockout embryos express high levels of UHRF1.

The phenotypic variability has been largely argued to be attributable to the extent of deregulation of the α subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor α, a well established target of VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase, ECV (Elongins/Cul2/VHL). Here, we show that erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) is hydroxylated on proline 419 and 426 via prolyl hydroxylase 3. EPOR hydroxylation is required for binding to the β domain of VHL and polyubiquitylation via ECV, leading to increased EPOR turnover. In addition, several type-specific VHL disease-causing mutants, including those that have retained proper binding and regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor α, showed a severe defect in binding prolyl hydroxylated EPOR peptides. These results identify EPOR as the secondbona fidehydroxylation-dependent substrate of VHL that potentially influences oxygen homeostasis and contributes to the complex genotype-phenotype correlation in VHL disease."

However, the mechanism by which the Vif protein of the related lentivirus bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) overcomes its host A3 proteins is less clear. In this study, we show that BIV Vif interacts with Cullin 2 (CUL2), ELOB/C, and RBX1, but not with CBF-β or CUL5, to form a CRL2 E3 ubiquitin ligase and degrade the restrictive bovine A3 proteins (A3Z2Z3 and A3Z3). RNA interference-mediated knockdown of ELOB or CUL2 inhibited BIV Vif-mediated degradation of these A3 proteins, whereas knockdown of CUL5 or CBF-β did not. BIV Vif with mutations in the BC box (Vif SLQ-AAA) or putative VHL box (Vif YI-AA), which cannot interact with ELOB/C or CUL2, respectively, lost the ability to counteract bovine A3 proteins. Moreover, CUL2 and UBE2M dominant negative mutants competitively inhibited the BIV Vif-mediated degradation mechanism. Thus, although the general strategy for inhibiting A3 proteins is conserved between HIV-1/SIV and BIV, the precise mechanisms can differ substantially, with only the HIV-1/SIV Vif proteins requiring CBF-β as a cofactor, HIV-1/SIV Vif using CUL5-RBX2, and BIV Vif using CUL2-RBX1."

Although great progress has been made, biological roles of p62 and relevant molecular mechanisms responsible for its pro-tumor activity remain largely unknown. Here, we show that p62 knockdown reduces cell growth and the expression of glycolytic genes in a manner that depends on HIF1α activity in renal cancer cells. Knockdown of p62 decreases HIF1α levels and transcriptional activity by regulating mTORC1 activity and NF-κB nuclear translocation. Furthermore, p62 interacts directly with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase complex to modulate the stability of HIF1α. Mechanistically, p62 binds to the VHL complex and competes with HIF1α. Expression of p62 inhibits the interaction of DCNL1 (also known as DCUN1D1) with CUL2 and attenuates the neddylation of CUL2, and thus downregulates the VHL E3 ligase complex activity. Functionally, HIF1α expression is required for p62-induced glucose uptake, lactate production and soft agar colony growth.

Here, we report that the oncogenic p73 isoform, ∆Np73, increases HIF-1α protein stability. We found that ∆Np73 represses expression of genes encoding subunits of the ECV complex, in particular Elongin C, Elongin B, Cullin 2, and Rbx1. The ECV complex is an E3 ligase complex responsible for polyubiquitinating HIF-1α. Loss of ∆Np73 increases ubiquitination of HIF-1α, leading to its degradation via the proteosomal pathway, and subsequent decrease of HIF-1α target genes.

Targeted proteolysis can overcome these limitations. In this report, we describe an affinity-directed protein missile (AdPROM) system that harbours the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, the substrate receptor of the Cullin2 (CUL2) E3 ligase complex, tethered to polypeptide binders that selectively bind and recruit endogenous target proteins to the CUL2-E3 ligase complex for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. By using synthetic monobodies that selectively bind the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and a camelid-derived VHH nanobody that selectively binds the human ASC protein, we demonstrate highly efficient AdPROM-mediated degradation of endogenous SHP2 and ASC in human cell lines. We show that AdPROM-mediated loss of SHP2 in cells impacts SHP2 biology. This study demonstrates for the first time that small polypeptide binders that selectively recognize endogenous target proteins can be exploited for AdPROM-mediated destruction of the target proteins."

Blocking the interaction of pVHL with elongin B/C resulted in accumulation of pVHL within the CCT complex. pVHL present in purified VHL-CCT complexes, when added to rabbit reticulocyte lysate, proceeded to form VCB and VCB-Cul2. Thus, CCT likely functions, at least in part, by retaining VHL chains pending the availability of elongin B/C for final folding and/or assembly. Tumor-associated mutations within exon II of the VHL syndrome had diverse effects upon the stability and/or function of pVHL-containing complexes. First, a pVHL mutant lacking the entire region encoded by exon II did not bind to CCT and yet could still assemble into complexes with elongin B/C and elongin B/C-Cul2. Second, a number of tumor-derived missense mutations in exon II did not decrease CCT binding, and most had no detectable effect upon VCB-Cul2 assembly. Many exon II mutants, however, were found to be defective in the binding to and subsequent ubiquitination of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha), a substrate of the VCB-Cul2 ubiquitin ligase. We conclude that the selection pressure to mutate VHL exon II during tumorigenesis does not relate to loss of CCT binding but may reflect quantitative or qualitative defects in HIF binding and/or in pVHL-dependent ubiquitin ligase activity."

This region mediates the formation of a multiprotein VHL complex containing elongin B, elongin C, cul-2, and Rbx1. This VHL complex is thought to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Here, we report that VHL proteins harboring mutations which disrupt elongin binding are unstable and rapidly degraded by the proteasome. In contrast, wild-type VHL proteins are directly stabilized by associating with both elongins B and C. In addition, elongins B and C are stabilized through their interactions with each other and VHL. Thus, the entire VHL/elongin complex is resistant to proteasomal degradation. Because the elongin-binding domain of VHL is frequently mutated in cancers, these results suggest that loss of elongin binding causes tumorigenesis by compromising VHL protein stability and/or potential VHL ubiquitination functions."

Interestingly, tumorigenic mutants and deletion mutants of pVHL, which are unable to form a Cul-2.VBC complex, do not have the activity to promote NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2. These results suggest that the complex formation is required for NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2. Furthermore, we used a pVHL-deficient cell line, 786-0, to show that Cul-2 is poorly but clearly conjugated by NEDD8, indicating that pVHL is not the only molecule that promotes NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2.

SAMHD1 knockdown using shRNA increased the activity of the viral UL99 late gene promoter in human fibroblasts by 7- to 9-fold, confirming its anti-HCMV activity. We also found that the level of SAMHD1 was initially increased by HCMV infection but decreased partly at the protein level at late stages of infection. SAMHD1 loss was not observed with UV-inactivated virus and required viral DNA replication. This reduction of SAMHD1 was effectively blocked by MLN4924, an inhibitor of the Cullin-RING-E3 ligase (CRL) complexes, but not by bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of vacuolar-type H+-ATPase. Indirect immunofluorescence assays further supported the CRL-mediated SAMHD1 loss at late stages of virus infection. Knockdown of CUL2 and to a lesser extent CUL1 using siRNA stabilized SAMHD1 in normal fibroblasts and inhibited SAMHD1 loss during virus infection.

Supplementation with 1,3,4-O-Bu3 ManNAc for two stable CHO cell lines, expressing human erythropoietin or IgG, enhanced protein expression for both products with negligible impact on cell growth, viability, glucose utilization, and lactate accumulation. In contrast, sodium butyrate treatment resulted in a ∼20% decrease in maximal viable cell density and ∼30% decrease in cell viability at the end of cell cultures compared to untreated or 1,3,4-O-Bu3 ManNAc treated CHO cell lines for both products. While NaBu treatment enhanced product yields more than the 1,3,4-O-Bu3 ManNAc treatment, the NaBu treated cells also exhibited higher levels of caspase 3 positive cells using microscopy analysis. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of four cell apoptosis genes (Cul2, BAK, BAX, and BCL2L11) were up-regulated more in sodium butyrate treated wild-type, erythropoietin, or IgG expressing CHO-K1 cell lines while most of the mRNA levels of apoptosis genes in 1,3,4-O-Bu3 ManNAc treated cell lines remained equal or increased only slightly compared to the levels in untreated CHO cell lines. Finally, lectin blot analysis revealed that the 1,3,4-O-Bu3 ManNAc-treated cells displayed higher relative sialylation levels on recombinant EPO, consistent with the effect of the ManNAc component of this additive, compared to control while NaBu treatment led to lower sialylation levels than control, or 1,3,4-O-Bu3 ManNAc-treatment. These findings demonstrate that 1,3,4-O-Bu3 ManNAc has fewer negative effects on cell cytotoxicity and apoptosis, perhaps as a result of a more deliberate uptake and release of the butyrate compounds, while simultaneously increasing the expression of multiple recombinant proteins, and improving the glycosylation characteristics when applied at comparable molarity levels to NaBu. Thus, 1,3,4-O-Bu3 ManNAc represents a highly promising media additive alternative in cell culture for improving protein yields without sacrificing cell mass and product quality in future bioproduction processes."

The precise mechanism of JDV Vif overcoming the antiviral activity of btA3 proteins is helpful for the application of the broad spectrum antiviral drug targeting conserved functional domains of various species Vif proteins in the future."

However, the impact of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) on HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection is not known. In this study, we have analyzed expression profiles of lincRNAs and mRNAs in monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs) infected with HIV-1/HIV-2 using microarrays. Our study identified many differentially expressed lincRNAs and mRNAs in MDMs infected with HIV-1/HIV-2 compared to uninfected MDMs. Genes involved in glutathione metabolism and lysine degradation were differentially regulated only in HIV-1 infected MDMs. In HIV-2 infected MDMs, CUL 2, SFRS9, and RBBP4 genes were differentially expressed. Furthermore, we found that plasma levels of lincRNA: chr2: 165509129-165519404 and lincRNA: chr12: 57761837-57762303 were better indicators of HIV-1 infection while lincRNA: chr10:128586385-128592960, XLOC_001148 and lincRNA: chr5:87580664-87583451, were better indicators of HIV-2 infection. In summary, our study has demonstrated that there is substantial alteration in lincRNA and mRNA expression in response to HIV-1/HIV-2 infection. These differentially expressed lincRNAs and mRNAs could serve as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers of HIV infection and help in the identification of new targets for therapy."

The aim of this study is to explore its expression pattern and tissue distribution in human normal tissues and other tumor tissues and to investigate the relevant mechanism. We firstly provided the expression profile and histological distribution of COMMD10 in various BALB/c mice tissues and identified the biological distribution of COMMD10 in different kinds of human normal and tumor tissues. We verified the expression profile of COMMD10 using TCGA database. The interacting genes of COMMD10 were predicted by using STRING using. Finally, we performed database, and the microRNAs targeting COMMD10 were predicted using miRDB, miRWalk, TargetScan and microRNA. GO and KEGG pathway analyses were performed to predict the biological function of COMMD10 and its interacting genes. mRNA expression of COMMD10 showed the highest level in the lung and spleen, and the lowest level in the heart and brain. Immunohistochemistry detection revealed that COMMD10 was expressed in different tissues with different degrees and was was located mainly in the cytoplasm. Subsequently, we showed that COMMD10 displayed various degrees of expression in different human normal tissues that mainly located in cytoplasm, while COMMD10 of liver cells resided in both nucleus and cytoplasm. All the tumor tissues except breast small cell carcinoma, breast phyllodes tumor, lung adenocarcinoma, thymoma, cervical cancer and bladder urothelial carcinoma showed that COMMD10 was positive staining in cytoplasm. Kaplan-Meier plotter indicated that renal clear cell carcinoma patients with increased expression level of COMMD10 exhibited longer survival. STRING database revealed that COMMD10 had 41 interacting genes, and data from 4 different databases indicated that hsa-miR-590-3p may be the potential regulator of COMMD10. GO analysis demonstrated that COMMD10 and its interacting genes were mainly enriched in Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complexes, binding and transport of copper ions, the transport and steady-state maintenance of copper ions, transcription, translation and transport of proteins, and negatively regulate the activity of NF-kappaB transcription factors. KEGG pathway showed that COMMD10 and its interacting genes were mainly involved in renal cell carcinoma, HIF-1 signaling pathways, ubiquitination-mediated proteolysis, endocytosis and mineral absorption.

CRL2(LRR-1) promotes germ cell proliferation by counteracting the DNA replication ATL-1 checkpoint pathway. CRL2(LRR-1) also participates in the mitotic proliferation/meiotic entry decision, presumably controlling the stability of meiotic promoting factors in the mitotic zone of the germline. Finally, CRL2(LRR-1) inhibits the first steps of meiotic prophase by targeting in mitotic germ cells degradation of the HORMA domain-containing protein HTP-3, required for loading synaptonemal complex components onto meiotic chromosomes. Given its widespread evolutionary conservation, CUL-2 may similarly regulate germline development in other organisms as well."

The family of SOCS proteins is divided into two groups: ancestral and vertebrate-specific SOCS proteins. Vertebrate-specific SOCS proteins have been heavily studied as a result of their strong mutant phenotypes. However, the ancestral clade remains less studied, a potential result of genetic redundancies in mammals. Use of the genetically tractable organism Drosophila melanogaster enables in vivo assessment of signaling components and mechanisms with less concern about the functional redundancy observed in mammals. In this study, we investigated how the SOCS family member Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling at 36E (Socs36E) attenuates Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (Jak/STAT) activation during specification of motile border cells in Drosophila oogenesis. We found that Socs36E genetically interacts with the Cullin2 (Cul2) scaffolding protein. Like Socs36E, Cul2 is required to limit the number of motile cells in egg chambers. We demonstrated that loss of Cul2 in the follicle cells significantly increased nuclear STAT protein levels, which resulted in additional cells acquiring invasive properties. Further, reduction of Cul2 suppressed border cell migration defects that occur in a Stat92E-sensitized genetic background. Our data incorporated Cul2 into a previously described Jak/STAT-directed genetic regulatory network that is required to generate a discrete boundary between cell fates. We also found that Socs36E is able to attenuate STAT activity in the egg chamber when it does not have a functional SOCS box. Collectively, this work contributes mechanistic insight to a Jak/STAT regulatory genetic circuit, and suggests that Socs36E regulates Jak/STAT signaling via a Cul2-dependent mechanism, as well as by a Cullin-independent manner, in vivo."

In cancer cells, many promoters become aberrantly methylated through the activity of the de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3a and DNMT3b and acquire repressive chromatin marks. NEDD8 is a ubiquitin-like protein modifier that is conjugated to target proteins, such as cullins, to regulate their activity, and cullin 4A (CUL4A) in its NEDD8-modified form is essential for repressive chromatin formation. We found that DNMT3b associates with NEDD8-modified proteins. Whereas DNMT3b interacts directly in vitro with NEDD8, conjugation of NEDD8 to target proteins enhances this interaction in vivo. DNMT3b immunoprecipitated two major bands of endogenously NEDDylated proteins at the size of NEDDylated cullins, and indeed DNMT3b interacted with CUL1, CUL2, CUL3, CUL4A, and CUL5. Moreover, DNMT3b preferentially immunoprecipitated the NEDDylated form of endogenous CUL4A. NEDD8 enhanced DNMT3b-dependent DNA methylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays suggest that DNMT3b recruits CUL4A and NEDD8 to chromatin, whereas deletion of Dnmt3b reduces the association of CUL4A and NEDD8 at a repressed promoter in a cancer cell line."

AdPROM consists of the Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein, a Cullin 2 E3 ligase substrate receptor (Bosu and Kipreos, 2008), conjugated to a high affinity polypeptide binder (such as a camelid nanobody) that recognises the target protein in cells. When introduced in cells, the target protein is recruited to the CUL2 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. For target protein recruitment, we have utilised both camelid-derived VHH domain nanobodies as well as synthetic polypeptide monobodies based on the human type III fibronectin domain ( Sha et al., 2013 ; Fridy et al., 2014 ; Schmidt et al., 2016 ). In this protocol, we describe detailed methodology involved in generating AdPROM constructs and their application in human cell lines for target protein destruction. AdPROM allows functional characterisation of the POI and its efficiency of target protein destruction overcomes many limitations of RNA-interference approaches, which necessitate long treatments and are associated with off-target effects, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, which is not always feasible."

This modular enzyme targets the alpha subunits of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for ubiquitin-mediated destruction. Consequently, tumour cells lacking functional pVHL overproduce the products of HIF-target genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes angiogenesis. This likely accounts for the hypervascular nature of VHL-associated neoplasms. Although pVHL has been linked to the cell-cycle, differentiation, and the regulation of extracellular matrix assembly, microenvironment pH, and tissue invasiveness, this review will focus on the recent insights into the molecular mechanisms governing the E3 ubiquitin ligase function of VEC."

Binding of p97 to substrates is mediated by cofactors that contain ubiquitin-binding domains. We employed ""network proteomics"" to show that p97 assembles with all of the 13 mammalian UBX-domain proteins. The UBX proteins that bind ubiquitin conjugates also interact with dozens of E3 ubiquitin ligases, only one of which had been previously linked to p97. In particular, UBXD7 links p97 to the ubiquitin ligase CUL2/VHL and its substrate hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha). Depletion of p97 leads to accumulation of endogenous HIF1alpha and increased expression of a HIF1alpha target gene. The large number of ubiquitin ligases found associated with UBX proteins suggests that p97 plays a far broader role than previously anticipated in the global regulation of protein turnover."

In this role, the acetyltransferase activity of GCN5 is not required. Interestingly, GCN5 binds more avidly to RelA after phosphorylation on Ser 468, an event that is dependent on IKK activity. Consistent with this, we find that both GCN5 and the IkappaB Kinase (IKK) complex promote RelA degradation.

ANK proteins are rare amongst viruses, with the exception of poxviruses, which presumably acquired them from the host via horizontal gene transfer. The architecture of poxvirus ANK proteins is, however, different from that of their cellular counterparts, and this precludes a direct acquisition event. Here we combine bioinformatics analysis and quantitative proteomics to discover a new class of viral ANK proteins with a domain organization that relates to cellular ANK proteins. These noncanonical viral ANK proteins, termed ANK/BC, interact with host Cullin-2 via a C-terminal BC box resembling that of cellular Cullin-2 substrate adaptors such as the von Hippel-Lindau protein. Mutagenesis of the BC box-like sequence abrogates binding to Cullin-2, whereas fusion of this motif to an ANK-only protein confers Cullin-2 association. We demonstrated that these viral ANK/BC proteins are potent immunomodulatory proteins suppressing the activation of the proinflammatory transcription factors NF-κB and interferon (IFN)-responsive factor 3 (IRF-3) and the production of cytokines and chemokines, including interferon, and that association with Cullin-2 is required for optimal inhibitory activity. ANK/BC proteins exist in several orthopoxviruses and cluster into 2 closely related orthologue groups in a phylogenetic lineage that is separate from that of canonical ANK/F-box proteins. Given the existence of cellular proteins with similar architecture, viral ANK/BC proteins may be closely related to the original ANK gene acquired by an ancestral orthopoxvirus. These findings uncover a novel viral strategy to antagonize innate immunity and shed light on the origin of the poxviral ANK protein family.IMPORTANCE Viruses encode multiple proteins aimed at modulating cellular homeostasis and antagonizing the host antiviral response. Most of these genes were originally acquired from the host and subsequently adapted to benefit the virus. ANK proteins are common in eukaryotes but are unusual amongst viruses, with the exception of poxviruses, where they represent one of the largest protein families. We report here the existence of a new class of viral ANK proteins, termed ANK/BC, that provide new insights into the origin of poxvirus ANK proteins. ANK/BC proteins target the host E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin-2 via a C-terminal BC box domain and are potent suppressors of the production of inflammatory cytokines, including interferon. The existence of cellular ANK proteins whose architecture is similar suggests the acquisition of a host ANK/BC gene by an ancestral orthopoxvirus and its subsequent duplication and adaptation to widen the repertoire of immune evasion strategies."

UBE2M knockdown increases DNA breakages and cellular sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, further suggesting heightened genomic instability and defective DNA repair activity. Investigating the downstream Cullin targets of UBE2M revealed that silencing of Cullin 1, 2, and 4 ligases incurred significant DNA damage. In particular, UBE2M knockdown, or defective neddylation of Cullin 2, leads to a blockade in the G1 to S progression and is associated with delayed S-phase dependent DNA damage response. Cullin 4 inactivation leads to an aberrantly high DNA damage response that is associated with increased DNA breakages and sensitivity of cells to DNA damaging agents, suggesting a DNA repair defect is associated. siRNA interrogation of key Cullin substrates show that CDT1, p21, and Claspin are involved in elevated DNA damage in the UBE2M knockdown cells. Therefore, UBE2M is required to maintain genome integrity by activating multiple Cullin ligases throughout the cell cycle."

We find that simultaneous depletion of larp-1 and the Nanos homologue nos-3 results in germline masculinization. This phenotype is accompanied by a strong reduction of the levels of TRA-1, a GLI-family transcription factor that promotes oogenesis. TRA-1 levels are regulated by CBC(FEM-1), a ubiquitin ligase consisting of the FEM proteins, FEM-1, FEM-2 and FEM-3 and the cullin CUL-2. We show that both the masculinization phenotype and the reduction of TRA-1 levels observed in nos-3;larp-1 mutants require fem-3 activity, suggesting that nos-3 and larp-1 regulate the sperm-oocyte switch by inhibiting the fem genes. Consistently, fem-3 mRNA levels are increased in larp-1 mutants. By contrast, levels of fem-3 mRNA are not affected in nos-3 mutants. Therefore, our data indicate that LARP-1 and NOS-3 promote oogenesis by regulating fem-3 expression through distinct mechanisms."
