PHYTOCHROME B (phyB) regulates plant growth through perceiving both light and ambient temperature signals. However, the mechanism by which phyB mediates the plant response to cold stress remains elusive. Here, we show that the key transcription factors mediating cold acclimation, C-REPEAT BINDING FACTORs (CBFs), interact with PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 3 (PIF3) under cold stress, thus attenuating the mutually assured destruction of PIF3-phyB. Cold-stabilized phyB acts downstream of CBFs to positively regulate freezing tolerance by modulating the expression of stress-responsive and growth-related genes. Consistent with this, phyB mutants exhibited a freezing-sensitive phenotype, whereas phyB-overexpression transgenic plants displayed enhanced freezing tolerance. Further analysis showed that the PIF1, PIF4, and PIF5 proteins, all of which negatively regulate plant freezing tolerance, were destabilized by cold stress in a phytochrome-dependent manner. Collectively, our study reveals that CBFs-PIF3-phyB serves as an important regulatory module for modulating plant response to cold stress."

Auxin is a pivotal phytohormone involved in promoting hypocotyl elongation. CRY1 and phyB interact with and stabilize auxin/indole acetic acid proteins (Aux/IAAs) to inhibit auxin signaling. The present study investigated whether photoreceptors might interact directly with Auxin Response Factors (ARFs) to regulate auxin signaling. Protein-protein interaction studies demonstrated that CRY1 and phyB interact physically with ARF6 and ARF8 through their N-terminal domains in a blue and red light-dependent manner, respectively. Moreover, the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of ARF6 and ARF8 is involved in mediating their interactions with CRY1. Genetic studies showed that ARF6 and ARF8 act partially downstream from CRY1 and PHYB to regulate hypocotyl elongation under blue and red light, respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR assays demonstrated that CRY1 and phyB mediate blue and red light repression of the DNA-binding activity of ARF6 and ARF6-target gene expression, respectively. Altogether, the results herein suggest that the direct repression of auxin-responsive gene expression mediated by the interactions of CRY1 and phyB with ARFs constitutes a new layer of the regulatory mechanisms by which light inhibits auxin-induced hypocotyl elongation."

Light is a major environmental factor affecting seed germination, which is predominantly regulated by photoreceptor phytochrome B (PHYB). PHYB is activated by red light (designated as PHYB-on) whereas it is inactivated by far-red light (referred as PHYB-off). We previously reported that Arabidopsis histone deacetylase HDA15 interacts with phytochrome-interacting factor1 (PIF1) to repress seed germination under PHYB-off conditions. Here, we show that HDA15 plays a negative role in regulating seed germination under PHYB-on conditions. Overexpression of HDA15 in Arabidopsis restrains PHYB-dependent seed germination, while gibberellin (GA) relieves the repressive role of HDA15 under PHYB-off conditions. We further show that HDA15 directly binds to GA20ox1 and GA20ox2, two key GA biosynthesis genes and represses their expression by removal of histone H3 and H4 acetylation. Moreover, the levels of HDA15 transcript and HDA15 protein are up-regulated in the phyB mutant. Collectively, our work proposes that HDA15 acts as a negative regulator of PHYB-dependent seed germination by directly repressing GA20ox1/2 gene expression."

Shade avoidance syndrome is a strategy of major adaptive significance that includes seed germination, elongation of vegetative structures, leaf hyponasty, and acceleration of flowering. Previously, we found that the southernmost Arabidopsis accession, collected in the south of Patagonia (Pat), is hyposensitive to light and displays a reduced response to shade light. This work aimed to explore the genetic basis of the shade avoidance response (SAR) for hypocotyl growth by QTL mapping in a recently developed 162 RIL population between Col-0 and Pat. We mapped four QTL for seedling hypocotyl growth: WL1 and WL2 QTL in white light, SHADE1 QTL in shade light, and SAR1 QTL for the SAR. PHYB is the strongest candidate gene for SAR1 QTL. Here we studied the function of two polymorphic indels in the promoter region, a GGGR deletion, and three non-synonymous polymorphisms on the PHYB coding region compared with the Col-0 reference genome. To decipher the contribution and relevance of each PHYB-Pat polymorphism, we constructed transgenic lines with single or double polymorphisms by using Col-0 as a reference genome. We found that single polymorphisms in the coding region of PHYB have discrete functions in seed germination, seedling development, and shade avoidance response. These results suggest distinct functions for each PHYB polymorphism to the adjustment of plant development to variable light conditions."

However, the role of light signaling in plant Fe uptake remains uncharacterized. Here, we find that light-induced Fe uptake in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is largely dependent on phytochrome B (phyB). Light induces the phyB-dependent accumulation of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) protein both in the leaves and roots. HY5 movement from shoots to roots activates the expression of FER transcription factor, leading to the accumulation of transcripts involved in Fe uptake. Mutation in FER abolishes the light quality-induced changes in Fe uptake. The low Fe uptake observed in phyB, hy5, and fer mutants is accompanied by lower photosynthetic electron transport rates. Exposure to red light at night increases Fe accumulation in wild-type fruit but has little effects on fruit of phyB mutants. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Fe uptake is systemically regulated by light in a phyB-HY5-FER-dependent manner. These findings provide new insights how the manipulation of light quality could be used to improve Fe uptake and hence the nutritional quality of crops."

Nonetheless, recent studies have shed light on the importance of alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) in photomorphogenesis. The splicing factors splicing factor for phytochrome signaling (SFPS) and reduced red-light responses in cry1cry2 background1 (RRC1) are involved in the phytochrome B (phyB) signaling pathway and promote photomorphogenesis by controlling pre-mRNA splicing of light- and clock-related genes. However, splicing factors that serve as repressors in phyB signaling pathway remain unreported. Here, we report that the splicing factor SWELLMAP 2 (SMP2) suppresses photomorphogenesis in the light. SMP2 physically interacts with phyB and colocalizes with phyB in photobodies after light exposure. Genetic analyses show that SMP2 antagonizes phyB signaling to promote hypocotyl elongation in the light. The homologs of SMP2 in yeast and human belong to second-step splicing factors required for proper selection of the 3' splice site (3'SS) of an intron. Notably, SMP2 reduces the abundance of the functional REVEILLE 8 a (RVE8a) form, probably by determining the 3'SS, and thereby inhibits RVE8-mediated transcriptional activation of clock genes containing evening elements (EE). Finally, SMP2-mediated reduction of functional RVE8 isoform promotes phytochrome interacting factor 4 (PIF4) expression to fine-tune hypocotyl elongation in the light. Taken together, our data unveil a phyB-interacting splicing factor that negatively regulates photomorphogenesis, providing additional information for further mechanistic investigations regarding phyB-controlled AS of light- and clock-related genes."

We describe a major thermosensory role for the phytochromes (red light receptors) during the night. Phytochrome null plants display a constitutive warm-temperature response, and consistent with this, we show in this background that the warm-temperature transcriptome becomes derepressed at low temperatures. We found that phytochrome B (phyB) directly associates with the promoters of key target genes in a temperature-dependent manner. The rate of phyB inactivation is proportional to temperature in the dark, enabling phytochromes to function as thermal timers that integrate temperature information over the course of the night."

In contrast, brassinosteroids (BRs) are major hypocotyl elongation-promoting hormones in plants, which could optimize photomorphogenesis concurrent with external light. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the antagonism of light and BR signaling remain largely unknown. Here we show that the Arabidopsis red light receptor phyB is involved in inhibition of BR signaling via its direct interaction with the BR transcription factor BES1. In our study, the phyB mutant displays BR hypersensitivity, which is repressed in transgenic plants overexpressing phyB, suggesting that phyB negatively regulates the BR signaling pathway. In addition, protein interaction results show that phyB directly interacts with dephosphorylated BES1, the physiologically active form of BES1 induced by BR, in a red light-dependent manner. Genetic analyses suggest that phyB may act partially through BES1 to regulate BR signaling. Transcriptomic data and quantitative real-time PCR assay further show that phyB-mediated red light inhibits BR signaling by repressing expression of BES1 target genes, including the BR biosynthesis genes DWF4, the SAUR family and the PRE family genes required for promoting cell elongation. Finally, we found that red light treatment inhibits the DNA-binding activity of BES1 and photoactivated phyB represses the transcriptional activity of BES1 under red light. Taken together, we suggest that the interaction of phyB with dephosphorylated BES1 may allow plants to balance light and BR signaling by repressing transcriptional activity of BES1 to regulate expression of its target genes."

Increased rates of thermal reversion upon exposing Arabidopsis seedlings to warm environments reduce both the abundance of the biologically active Pfr-Pfr dimer pool of phyB and the size of the associated nuclear bodies, even in daylight. Mathematical analysis of stem growth for seedlings expressing wild-type phyB or thermally stable variants under various combinations of light and temperature revealed that phyB is physiologically responsive to both signals. We therefore propose that in addition to its photoreceptor functions, phyB is a temperature sensor in plants."

Notably, the photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB) was recently shown to function as a thermosensor, thus reinforcing the notion that light and temperature signaling pathways are tightly associated in plants.

In this study, we demonstrate that B-BOX PROTEIN 11 (BBX11) physically interacts with both phyB and PIF4. BBX11 negatively regulates PIF4 accumulation as well as its biochemical activity, consequently leading to the repression of PIF4-controlled genes' expression and promotion of photomorphogenesis in the prolonged red light.

Moreover, the red/far-red light photoreceptor phyB interacts with SPA1 through its C-terminus and enhances the recruitment of PIF1 for phosphorylation.

Despite extensive biochemical studies, full understanding of plant Phy signalling has remained unclear due to the absence of relevant 3D models. Here we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of Arabidopsis PhyB in the Pr state that reveals a topologically complex dimeric organization that is substantially distinct from its prokaryotic relatives. Instead of an anticipated parallel architecture, the C-terminal histidine-kinase-related domains (HKRDs) associate head-to-head, whereas the N-terminal photosensory regions associate head-to-tail to form a parallelogram-shaped platform with near two-fold symmetry. The platform is internally linked by the second of two internal Per/Arnt/Sim domains that binds to the photosensory module of the opposing protomer and a preceding 'modulator' loop that assembles tightly with the photosensory module of its own protomer. Both connections accelerate the thermal reversion of Pfr back to Pr, consistent with an inverse relationship between dimer assembly and Pfr stability. Lopsided contacts between the HKRDs and the platform create profound asymmetry to PhyB that might imbue distinct signalling potentials to the protomers. We propose that this unique structural dynamism creates an extensive photostate-sensitive surface for conformation-dependent interactions between plant Phy photoreceptors and their signalling partners."

Here, we show that epidermis-specific expression of PIF4 induces constitutive long hypocotyls, while vasculature-specific expression of PIF4 has no effect on hypocotyl growth. RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR analyses reveal that auxin-responsive genes and growth-related genes are highly activated by epidermal, but not by vascular, PIF4. Additionally, inactivation of epidermal PIF4 or auxin signaling, and overexpression of epidermal phyB suppresses thermoresponsive growth, indicating that epidermal PIF4-auxin pathways are essential for the temperature responses.

The rrc1-689 mutation increases the alternative splicing of major clock gene transcripts, including PRR7 and TOC1, disrupting the rhythmic expression of the entire clock and clock-controlled genes. Combined with the result that MLB/prr7 exhibits the same red-hyposensitive phenotypes as MLB/rrc1-689, our data support that the circadian clock is required for the ability of epidermal phyB to promote light responses.

However, our understanding of the molecular mechanism of thermomorphogenesis is still rudimentary. Here, we show that a set of four SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 (SPA) genes is required for thermomorphogenesis.

In the spaQ mutant at high ambient temperature, the level of SPA1 is unaffected, whereas the thermosensor phytochrome B (phyB) is stabilized. Furthermore, in the absence of four SPA genes, the pivotal transcription factor PIF4 fails to accumulate, indicating a role of SPAs in regulating the phyB-PIF4 module at high ambient temperature. SPA1 directly phosphorylates PIF4 in vitro, and a mutant SPA1 affecting the kinase activity fails to rescue the PIF4 level in addition to the thermo-insensitive phenotype of spaQ, suggesting that the SPA1 kinase activity is necessary for thermomorphogenesis.

We analyzed our experimental data using a mathematical model containing multiple Pfr conformers, in accordance with previous findings.

This study adds data to the picture of light and temperature signaling cross-talk in plants, which is important for the exploration of complicated HS responses or light-mediated mechanisms.

How phyB distinguishes these signals remains elusive. Here, we report that phyB spontaneously undergoes phase separation to assemble liquid-like droplets. This capacity is driven by its C terminus through self-association, whereas the intrinsically disordered N-terminal extension (NTE) functions as a biophysical modulator of phase separation. Light exposure triggers a conformational change to subsequently alter phyB condensate assembly, while temperature sensation is directly mediated by the NTE to modulate the phase behavior of phyB droplets. Multiple signaling components are selectively incorporated into phyB droplets to form concentrated microreactors, allowing switch-like control of phyB signaling activity through phase transitions. Therefore, light and temperature cues are separately read out by phyB via allosteric changes and spontaneous phase separation, respectively. We provide a conceptual framework showing how the distinct but highly correlated physical signals are interpreted and sorted by one receptor."

BBX4 associates with PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3 (PIF3) and represses PIF3 transcriptional activation activity and PIF3-controlled gene expression. The degradation of BBX4 in darkness is dependent on CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) and the 26S proteasome system. Collectively, BBX4 acts as a key component of the phyB-PIF3-mediated signaling module and fine tunes the red light action. phyB promotes the accumulation of BBX4, which in turn serves to repress PIF3 action through direct physical interaction to promote photomorphogenic development in red light."

Either its expression or its accumulation peaks in the morning and afternoon. WRKY2 and WRKY10 form heterodimers and recognize their target site in the PIF4 promoter near the MYB element that is bound by CCA1 and LHY under red and blue light. WRKY2 and WRKY10 interact directly with CCA1/LHY to enhance their targeting but interact indirectly with SHB1. The two WRKY proteins also interact with phyB, and their interaction enhances the targeting of CCA1 and LHY to the PIF4 promoter. SHB1 associates with the WRKY2 and WRKY10 loci and enhances their expression in parallel with the PIF4 expression peaks. This forward regulatory loop further sustains the accumulation of the two WRKY proteins and the targeting of CCA1/LHY to the PIF4 locus.

We have isolated overlapping cDNA and genomic clones encoding the entire phyB polypeptide. This monocot sequence is more closely related to phyB from the dicot, Arabidopsis (73% amino acid sequence identity), than it is to the phyA gene in the rice genome (50% identity). These data support the proposal that phyA and phyB subfamilies diverged early in plant evolution and that subsequent divergence accompanied the evolution of monocots and dicots. Moreover, since rice and Arabidopsis phyB polypeptides are more closely related to one another (73% identity) than are monocot and dicot phyA sequences (63-65% identity), it appears that phyB has evolved more slowly than phyA. Sequence conservation between phyA and phyB is greatest in a central core region surrounding the chromophore attachment site, and least toward the amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal ends of the polypeptides, although hydropathy analysis suggests that the overall structure of the two phytochromes has been conserved. Gene-specific Northern blot analysis indicates that, whereas phyA is negatively regulated by phytochrome in rice seedling shoots in the manner typical of monocots, phyB is constitutively expressed irrespective of light treatment. In consequence, phyA and phyB transcripts are equally abundant in fully green tissue. Since Arabidopsis phyB mRNA levels are also unaffected by light, the present results suggest that this mode of regulation is evolutionarily conserved among phyB genes, perhaps reflecting differences in the functional roles of the different phytochrome subfamilies."

Moench] phyB-1 mutant exhibits a constitutive shade-avoidance phenotype including excessive shoot elongation. It was previously shown that this mutant also overproduces ethylene. Although phytochrome B (phyB) is assumed to be the pigment most important in sensing and transducing shade signals, the sorghum phyB-1 mutant still responds to light signals characteristic of shade. Specifically, it was determined that the leaf blade : leaf sheath elongation of phyB-1 is responsive to red : far red (R : FR), but this response is opposite that of wild type (WT). Reducing the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) strongly reduced the leaf blade : leaf sheath of WT but did not affect phyB-1, demonstrating a role for phyB in sensing PPFD. Using light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, it was found that WT ethylene production was increased with low R : FR while PPFD had no effect. Conversely, phyB-1 ethylene production increased only with high PPFD, high R : FR which was the treatment resulting in the least ethylene production by WT. Elevated ethylene production inhibits shoot elongation, but may contribute to shade avoidance by reducing leaf blade : leaf sheath elongation. Ethylene responses to light treatments designed to promote or reduce phytochrome A (phyA) activity, and the analysis of PHYA levels in the two cultivars suggests that phyA could be involved in transducing shade signals in light-grown sorghum. Responses potentially tranduced by phyA are elevated in phyB-1 which also over-expresses PHYA."

However, the role of phytochromes in promoting leaf senescence under FR-enriched conditions is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the role of phyA and phyB in regulating leaf senescence under FR in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). FR enrichment and intermittent FR pulses promoted the senescence of Arabidopsis leaves. Additionally, phyA and phyB mutants showed enhanced and repressed senescence phenotypes in FR, respectively, indicating that phyA and phyB antagonistically regulate FR-dependent leaf senescence. Transcriptomic analysis using phyA and phyB mutants in FR identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in leaf senescence-related processes, such as responses to light, phytohormones, temperature, photosynthesis and defense, showing opposite expression patterns in phyA and phyB mutants. These contrasting expression profiles of DEGs support the antagonism between phyA and phyB in FR-dependent leaf senescence. Among the genes showing antagonistic regulation, we confirmed that the expression of WRKY6, which encodes a senescence-associated transcription factor, was negatively and positively regulated by phyA and phyB, respectively. The wrky6 mutant showed a repressed senescence phenotype compared with the wild type in FR, indicating that WRKY6 plays a positive role in FR-dependent leaf senescence.

However, the upstream guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) RopGEFs have not been revealed, and it is unclear which photoreceptor is required for the action of RopGEFs-ROPs. Here, we showed that RopGEF2 acted as a negative regulator in phytochrome B (phyB)-mediated red light-induced stomatal opening. Meanwhile, ROP7, another member of ROP family, acting redundantly with ROP2, was regulated by RopGEF2 in this process. RopGEF2 interacted with ROP7 and ROP2 and enhanced their intrinsic nucleotide exchange rates. Furthermore, the direct interactions between phyB and RopGEF2 were detected in vitro and in plants, and phyB enhanced the GEF activity of RopGEF2 toward both ROP7 and ROP2 under light. In addition, RopGEF4 functioned redundantly with RopGEF2 in red light-induced stomatal opening by activating both ROP7 and ROP2, and RopGEF2/RopGEF4 acted genetically downstream of phyB; however, the GEF activity of RopGEF4 was not directly enhanced by phyB. These results revealed that red light-activated phyB enhances the GEF activities of RopGEF2 and RopGEF4 directly or indirectly, and then activate both ROP7 and ROP2 in guard cells.

While these pathways have been extensively studied, the complex nature of their molecular dialogue is still obscure. When mobilized by the Arabidopsis thaliana β-glucosidase 1 (AtBG1), the glucose ester-conjugated inactive form of ABA has proven to be a source of the active hormone that is essential for the adaptation of the plant to water deficit, as evidenced by the impaired stomatal closure of atbg1 mutants in response to water stress. In a suppressor screen designed to identify the molecular components of AtBG1-associated physiological and developmental mechanisms, we identified the mutation variant of AtBG1 traits (vat1), a new mutant allele of the red light/far-red light photoreceptor PHYTOCHROME B (PHYB). Our study reveals that atbg1 plants harbor increased stomatal density in addition to impaired stomatal closure. We also provide evidence that the vat1/phyb mutation can restore the apparent transpiration of the atbg1 mutant by decreasing stomatal aperture and restoring a stomatal density similar to wild-type plants. Expression of key regulators of stomatal development showed a crosstalk between AtBG1-mediated ABA signaling and PHYB-mediated stomatal development.

Both phyA and phyB, the two best characterized phytochromes, regulate plant photomorphogenesis predominantly under far-red light and red light, respectively. It has been demonstrated that SPA1 (SUPPRESSOR OF PHYTOCHROME A 1) associates with COP1 to promote COP1 activity and suppress photomorphogenesis.

Expression analysis indicates that the PB-phyB, PB-phyD, and PB-phyE transgenes are transcriptionally and translationally active. However, whereas the PB-phyB transgene complements the phyB-1 red light hypocotyl growth phenotype completely, the PB-phyD and PB-phyE transgenes are only weakly active in restoring seedling growth regulation.

This inhibition is specific to phyB in that the levels of the four other phytochromes, notably the closely related phyD and phyE phytochromes, are unaffected in the antisense lines. Antisense-induced reduction in phyB causes alterations of red light effects on seedling hypocotyl elongation, rosette leaf morphology, and chlorophyll content, similar to the phenotypic changes caused by phyB null mutations. However, unlike the phyB mutants, the antisense lines do not flower early compared to the wild type.

The phyB-103 PHYB transcript is larger than the wild-type PHYB transcript and DNA sequence analysis showed that the entire intron is retained in the mature PHYB transcript of phyB-103.

Tillering is inhibited in sorghum genotypes that lack phytochrome B (58M, phyB-1) until after floral initiation. The growth of tiller buds in the first leaf axil of wild-type (100M, PHYB) and phyB-1 sorghum genotypes is similar until 6 d after planting when buds of phyB-1 arrest growth, while wild-type buds continue growing and develop into tillers. Transcriptome analysis at this early stage of bud development identified numerous genes that were up to 50-fold differentially expressed in wild-type/phyB-1 buds. Up-regulation of terminal flower1, GA2oxidase, and TPPI could protect axillary meristems in phyB-1 from precocious floral induction and decrease bud sensitivity to sugar signals. After bud growth arrest in phyB-1, expression of dormancy-associated genes such as DRM1, GT1, AF1, and CKX1 increased and ENOD93, ACCoxidase, ARR3/6/9, CGA1, and SHY2 decreased. Continued bud outgrowth in wild-type was correlated with increased expression of genes encoding a SWEET transporter and cell wall invertases. The SWEET transporter may facilitate Suc unloading from the phloem to the apoplast where cell wall invertases generate monosaccharides for uptake and utilization to sustain bud outgrowth. Elevated expression of these genes was correlated with higher levels of cytokinin/sugar signaling in growing buds of wild-type plants."

It has been hypothesized that altered homeostasis of phytohormones such as auxin and strigolactone is at least partially responsible for SAR, but the mechanism underlying phyB regulation of the hormonal change is not fully understood. Previously we reported that CONSTANS-LIKE 7 (COL7) enhances branching number under high R:FR but not under low R:FR, implying that COL7 may be involved in the phyB-mediated SAR. In this study, we provide evidence that COL7 reduces auxin levels in a high R:FR-dependent manner. We found that the phyB mutation suppresses the COL7-induced branching proliferation. Moreover, COL7 promotes mRNA expression of SUPERROOT 2 (SUR2), which encodes a suppressor of auxin biosynthesis, in high R:FR but not in low R:FR. Consistently with these results, deficiency of phyB suppresses the elevated transcription of SUR2 in COL7 overexpression plants grown in high R:FR. Taking these results together with data suggesting that photo-excited phyB is required for stabilization of the COL7 protein, we argue that COL7 is a critical factor linking light perception to changes in auxin level in Arabidopsis."

The hypersensitive phenotype of srl1 is not due to overexpression of endogenous phyA or phyB, and the locus maps to the center of chromosome 2, distinct from any other known photomorphogenic mutants. srl1 seedlings display enhancement of several phyB-mediated responses, including shorter hypocotyls, more expanded cotyledons, shorter petioles and modestly higher levels of CAB gene expression under red light than the wild type.

This suggests the involvement of at least one other phytochrome, phyC, D, and/or E, in controlling seed germination. We designated this spectrally active phytochrome in phyA/phyB as phyX. The full reversibility of the R-induced germination by subsequent FR pulses, and the observation that the response is reversible by FR, even after a 3-h R treatment, indicates that this phyX response belongs to the low-fluence-response type. Thus, this phyX response is functionally related to phyB-mediated responses. However, in contrast to phyB-controlled seed germination, this phyX-mediated response needs a prolonged imbibition period and exhibits reversibility kinetics different from that needed for phyB. Furthermore, this phyX response requires a prolonged irradiation time and shows a fluence rate response dependency, showing a similarity to the high irradiance response of photomorphogenesis. Thus, phyX, with regard to its control of seed germination, is a functionally new phytochrome that shares some characteristics of both phyA- and phyB-mediated responses."

However, it is unknown how plants manage their responsiveness to fluctuating temperatures in inducing thermomorphogenic behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1 (SMAX1), known as a karrikin signaling repressor, enhances the thermosensitivity of hypocotyl morphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Hypocotyl thermomorphogenesis was largely disrupted in SMAX1-deficient mutants. SMAX1 interacts with phyB to alleviate its suppressive effects on the transcription factor activity of PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4), promoting hypocotyl thermomorphogenesis. Interestingly, the SMAX1 protein is slowly destabilized at warm temperatures, preventing hypocotyl overgrowth.

Double mutations in LHY and CCA1 (lhy;cca1) accelerated flowering under short days, mainly by the GI-CO dependent pathway. In contrast, lhy;cca1 showed delayed flowering under continuous light (LL), probably due to the GI-CO independent pathway. This late-flowering phenotype was suppressed by svp, flc, and elf3. However, how SVP, FLC, and ELF3 mediate LHY/CCA1 and flowering time is not fully understood. We found that lhy;cca1 exhibited short hypocotyls and petioles under LL, but the molecular mechanism for these effects has not been elucidated. To address these questions, we performed a screen for mutations that suppress either or both of the lhy;cca1 phenotypes under LL, using two different approaches. We identified two novel mutations, a dominant (del1) and a recessive (phyB-2511) allele of phyB. The flowering times of single mutants of three phyB alleles, hy3-1, del1, and phyB-2511, are almost the same and earlier than those of wild-type plants. A similar level of acceleration of flowering time was observed in all three phyB mutants tested when combined with the late-flowering mutations co-2 and SVPox. However, the effect of phyB-2511 on lhy;cca1 was different from those by hy3-1 or del1. svp-3 did not strongly enhance the early-flowering phenotypes of phyB-2511 or del1. These results suggest that light signaling via PhyB may affect factors downstream of the clock proteins, controlling flowering time and organ elongation. phyB mutations with different levels of effects on lhy;cca1-dependent late flowering would be useful to determine a specific role for PHYB in the flowering pathway controlled by lhy;cca1 under LL."

The active homodimer, 183 kDa, was reduced to a 92 kDa monomer. The DLS data taken together with activity measurements could indicate whether refolding took place or not in PhyB phytase. The correlation between molecular mass and the state of unfolding and refolding is a very strong one in fungal phytase belonging to histidine acid phosphatase (HAP). Unlike PhyA phytase, for which sodium chloride treatment boosted the activity at 0.5 M salt concentration, PhyB phytase activity was severely inhibited under identical condition.

In phyB mutants, but not in phyA mutants, a four- to six-fold reduction in the level of phyC is observed in tissues grown either in the dark or in the light.

However, in transgenic lines that overexpress phyB 15- to 20-fold, phyC is not similarly overexpressed. In these overexpressor lines, the levels of phyA, phyC, and phyD are increased two- to four-fold over normal in light-grown but not dark-grown seedlings.

In dark-grown seedlings, both promoters are 4-fold more active in shoots than in roots,but the PHYA promoter is nearly 20-fold more active than that of PHYB in both organs. In shoots, white light represses the activities of the PHYA and PHYB promoters 10- and 2-fold, respectively, whereas in roots light has no effect on the PHYA promoter but increases PHYB promoter activity 2-fold. Consequently, PHYA promoter activity remains higher than that of PHYB in light in both shoots (5-fold) and roots (11-fold). Experiments with narrow-waveband light and photomorphogenic mutants suggest that no single photoreceptor is necessary for full white-light-directed PHYA repression in shoots, but that multiple, independent photoreceptor pathways are sufficient alone or in combination. In contrast, phytochrome B appears both necessary and sufficient for a light-mediated decrease in PHYB activity in shoots, and phytochrome A mediates a far-red-light-stimulated increase in PHYB promoter activity. Together, the data indicate that the PHYA and PHYB genes are regulated in divergent fashion at the transcriptional level, both developmentally and by the spectral distribution of the prevailing light, and that this regulation may be important to the photosensory function of the two photoreceptors."

The data indicate that regulation is at the transcriptional level. In dry seed, PHYB-GUS is expressed throughout the embryo at three-fold higher levels than PHYB-GUS, which is confined primarily to the embryonic root tip. By contrast, PHYA promoter activity, despite strong negative regulation in shoots by light, is consistently higher than PHYB (two- to 20-fold) in both the light and dark in most tissues during all subsequent developmental phases, from seedling to mature adult. At the tissue level, most cells appear to express both transgenes at some level at all stages examined, with highest apparent activity in vascular tissue and root tips. With the notable exception of pollen, where high PHYB-GUS but not PHYA-GUS expression occurs, few major differences are observed in the quantitative spatial distribution pattern between the two transgenes. The strongly similar spatial and temporal expression patterns of PHYA-GUS and PHYB-GUS transgenes suggest that the differential photosensory activity of these two phytochromes occurs largely through differences in their (i) intrinsic biochemical activities, (ii) relative abundances, and/or (iii) independent and separate reaction partners, rather than through discrete, developmentally controlled expression patterns."

Remarkable overaccumulation of monosaccharide, such as glucose (53.4-fold), fructose (42.5-fold), and galactose (24.5-fold), was observed in young leaves of phyA phyB phyC triple mutants.

COP1 interacts with and ubiquitinates the transcription factors that promote photomorphogenesis, such as ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 and LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED1 (HFR1), to inhibit photomorphogenic development. Here, we show that COP1 physically interacts with PIF3-LIKE1 (PIL1) and promotes PIL1 degradation via the 26S proteasome. We further demonstrate that phyB physically interacts with PIL1 and enhances PIL1 protein accumulation upon red light irradiation, probably through suppressing the COP1-PIL1 association. Biochemical and genetic studies indicate that PIL1 and HFR1 form heterodimers and promote photomorphogenesis cooperatively. Moreover, we demonstrate that PIL1 interacts with PIF1, 3, 4, and 5, resulting in the inhibition of the transcription of PIF direct-target genes. Our results reveal that PIL1 stability is regulated by phyB and COP1, likely through physical interactions, and that PIL1 coordinates with HFR1 to inhibit the transcriptional activity of PIFs, suggesting that PIL1, HFR1, and PIFs constitute a subset of antagonistic basic helix-loop-helix factors acting downstream of phyB and COP1 to regulate photomorphogenic development."

Chloroplast movements in wild-type plants were intermediate between those of the single phot mutants, consistent with each operating through separate signalling cascades. Mutants in phot2 showed transient chloroplast avoidance responses upon exposure to intense blue light, and slow but sustained chloroplast avoidance under intense white light, indicating that in the absence of phot2, phot1 is capable of generating both a low and a high-light response signal. Mutations in phytochrome B (phyB) caused an enhanced avoidance response at intermediate and high light intensities. Examination of phyB, phot1phyB, and phot2phyB mutants indicated that this enhancement is caused by PhyB inhibition of the high-light avoidance response in wild-type plants.

The intracellular signaling pathway from the light-activated photoreceptor conformer (Pfr) to the transcriptional network that drives these responses involves direct, physical interaction of Pfr with a small subfamily of bHLH transcription factors, termed Phy-Interacting Factors (PIFs), which induces rapid PIF proteolytic degradation. In addition, there is evidence of further complexity in light-grown seedlings, whereby phyB-PIF interaction reciprocally induces phyB degradation, in a mutually-negative, feedback-loop configuration. Here, to assess the relative contributions of these antagonistic activities to the net phenotypic readout in light-grown seedlings, we have examined the magnitude of the light- and simulated-shade-induced responses of a pentuple phyBpif1pif3pif4pif5 (phyBpifq) mutant and various multiple pif-mutant combinations. The data (1) reaffirm that phyB is the predominant, if not exclusive, photoreceptor imposing the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in deetiolating seedlings in response to prolonged continuous R irradiation and (2) show that the PIF quartet (PIF1, PIF3, PIF4, and PIF5) retain and exert a dual capacity to modulate hypocotyl elongation under these conditions, by concomitantly promoting cell elongation through intrinsic transcriptional-regulatory activity, and reducing phyB-inhibitory capacity through feedback-loop-induced phyB degradation. In shade-exposed seedlings, immunoblot analysis shows that the shade-imposed reduction in Pfr levels induces increases in the abundance of PIF3, and mutant analysis indicates that PIF3 acts, in conjunction with PIF4 and PIF5, to promote the known shade-induced acceleration of hypocotyl elongation. Conversely, although the quadruple pifq mutant displays clearly reduced hypocotyl elongation compared to wild-type in response to prolonged shade, immunoblot analysis detects no elevation in phyB levels in the mutant seedlings compared to the wild-type during the majority of the shade-induced growth period, and phyB levels are not robustly correlated with the growth phenotype across the pif-mutant combinations compared. These results suggest that PIF feedback modulation of phyB abundance does not play a dominant role in modulating the magnitude of the PIF-promoted, shade-responsive phenotype under these conditions. In seedlings grown under diurnal light-dark cycles, the data show that FR-pulse-induced removal of Pfr at the beginning of the dark period (End-of-Day-FR (EOD-FR) treatment) results in longer hypocotyls relative to no EOD-FR treatment and that this effect is attenuated in the pif-mutant combinations tested. This result similarly indicates that the PIF quartet members are capable of intrinsically promoting hypocotyl cell elongation in light-grown plants, independently of the effects of PIF feedback modulation of photoactivated-phyB abundance."

However, we have shown that the production of chromophores used in Phytochrome B (PhyB) optogenetics is greatly enhanced in mammalian cells by expressing bacterial and plant Fds with ferredoxin-NADP+ reductases (FNR). We delineated the rate limiting factors and found that the main metabolic precursor, heme, was not the primary limiting factor for producing either the cyanobacterial or plant chromophores, phycocyanobilin or phytochromobilin, respectively. In fact, Fd is limiting, followed by Fd+FNR and finally heme. Using these findings, we optimized the PCB production system and combined it with a tissue penetrating red/far-red sensing PhyB optogenetic gene switch in animal cells. We further characterized this system in several mammalian cell lines using red and far-red light. Importantly, we found that the light-switchable gene system remains active for several hours upon illumination, even with a short light pulse, and requires very small amounts of light for maximal activation. Boosting chromophore production by matching metabolic pathways with specific ferredoxin systems will enable the unparalleled use of the many PhyB optogenetic tools and has broader implications for optimizing synthetic metabolic pathways."

To gain insight into the molecular mechanism underlying this complex phenotype, we generated transgenic lines expressing the mutant and wild-type phyB in phyB-9 background. Analysis of these transgenic lines demonstrated that the mutant photoreceptor displays a reduced rate of dark-reversion but normal P(fr) to P(r) photoconversion in vivo and shows an altered pattern of association/dissociation with nuclear bodies compared to wild-type phyB. In addition we show (i) an enhanced responsiveness to far-red light for hypocotyl growth inhibition and CAB2 expression and (ii) that far-red light mediated photoreversibility of red light induced responses, including inhibition of hypocotyl growth, formation of nuclear bodies and induction of CAB2 expression is reduced in these transgenic lines. We hypothesize that the incomplete photoreversibility of signalling is due to the fact that far-red light induced photoconversion of the chromophore is at least partially uncoupled from the P(fr) to P(r) conformation change of the protein. It follows that the phyB-401 photoreceptor retains a P(fr)-like structure (P(r) (*)) for a few hours after the far-red light treatment. The greatly reduced rate of dark reversion and the formation of a biologically active P(r) (*) conformer satisfactorily explain the complex phenotype of the phyB-401 mutant and suggest that amino acid residues surrounding the position 564 G play an important role in fine-tuning phyB signalling."

Thanks to these sensory capacities, phyB perceives whether plant organs are buried in the soil, exposed to full sunlight, in the presence of nearby vegetation, and/or under risk of heat stress. In some species, phyB perceives seasonal daylength cues. phyB affects the activity of several transcriptional regulators either by direct physical interaction or indirectly by physical interaction with proteins involved in the turnover of transcriptional regulators. Typically, interaction of a protein with phyB has either negative or positive effects on the interaction of the latter with a third party, this being another protein or DNA. Thus, phyB mediates the context-dependent modulation of the transcriptome underlying changes in plant morphology, physiology, and susceptibility to biotic and abiotic stress. phyB operates as a dynamic switch that improves carbon balance, prioritizing light interception and photosynthetic capacity in open places and the projection of the shoot towards light in the soil, under shade and in warm conditions."

We speculated that light-quality signals of neighbouring vegetation might increase susceptibility to heat shocks because shade reduces tissue temperature and hence the likeness of heat shocks. In contrast, plants of Arabidopsis thaliana grown under low-red/far-red ratios typical of shade were less damaged by heat stress than plants grown under simulated sunlight. Neighbour signals reduce the activity of phytochrome B (phyB), increasing the abundance of PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs). The phyB mutant showed high tolerance to heat stress even under simulated sunlight, and a pif multiple mutant showed low tolerance under simulated shade. phyB and red/far-red ratio had no effects on seedlings acclimated with nonstressful warm temperatures before the heat shock. The phyB mutant showed reduced expression of several fatty acid desaturase (FAD) genes and less proportion of fully unsaturated fatty acids and electrolyte leakage of membranes exposed to heat shocks. Red-light-activated phyB also reduced thermotolerance of dark-grown seedlings but not via changes in FADs expression and membrane stability. We propose that the reduced photosynthetic capacity linked to thermotolerant membranes would be less costly under shade, where the light input limits photosynthesis."

Comparison of the observed expression patterns with those induced by continuous monochromatic far-red light (FRc; perceived exclusively by phyA) in WT and phyA null-mutant seedlings suggests early convergence of the FRc and Rc photosensory pathways to control a largely common transcriptional network. phyB mutant seedlings retain a surprisingly high level of responsiveness to Rc for the majority of Rc-regulated genes on the microarray, indicating that one or more other phys have a major role in regulating their expression. Combined with the robust visible morphogenic phenotype of the phyB mutant in Rc, these data suggest that different members of the phy family act in organ-specific fashion in regulating seedling de-etiolation. Specifically, phyB appears to be the dominant, if not exclusive, photoreceptor in regulating a minority population of genes involved in suppression of hypocotyl cell elongation in response to Rc signals. By contrast, this sensory function is apparently shared by one or more other phys in regulating the majority Rc-responsive gene set involved in other important facets of the de-etiolation process in the apical region, such as cotyledon cell expansion."

We investigated the interaction between phytochromes and cry1 in the control of hypocotyl growth and cotyledon unfolding. Under conditions deficient for cry1 (short exposures to blue light) or phyB (far-red background), these photoreceptors acted synergistically: Under short exposures to blue light (3 h/d) added to a red-light background, cry1 activity required phyB (e.g. the hy4 mutant was taller than the wild type but the phyBhy4 mutant was not taller than the phyB mutant). Under prolonged exposures to blue light (24 h/d) added to a far-red light background, phyB activity required cry1 (e.g. the phyAphyB mutant was taller than the phyA mutant but the phyAphyBhy4 mutant was not taller than the phyAhy4 mutant). Under more favorable light inputs, i.e. prolonged exposures to blue light added to a red-light background, the effects of cry1 and phyB were independent. Thus, the synergism between phyB and cry1 is conditional. The effect of cry1 was not reduced by the phyA mutation under any tested light condition. Under continuous blue light the triple mutant phyAphyBhy4 showed reduced hypocotyl growth inhibition and cotyledon unfolding compared with the phyAphyB mutant.

Similar to PIF3, upon light exposure, PIF7 rapidly migrates to intranuclear speckles, where it colocalizes with phyB. However, in striking contrast to PIF3, this process is not accompanied by detectable light-induced phosphorylation or degradation of PIF7, suggesting that the consequences of interaction with photoactivated phyB may differ among PIFs. Nevertheless, PIF7 acts similarly to PIF3 in prolonged red light as a weak negative regulator of phyB-mediated seedling deetiolation. Examination of pif3, pif4, and pif7 double mutant combinations shows that their moderate hypersensitivity to extended red light is additive. We provide evidence that the mechanism by which these PIFs operate on the phyB signaling pathway under prolonged red light is through maintaining low phyB protein levels, in an additive or synergistic manner, via a process likely involving the proteasome pathway. These data suggest that the role of these phyB-interacting bHLH factors in modulating seedling deetiolation in prolonged red light may not be as phy-activated signaling intermediates, as proposed previously, but as direct modulators of the abundance of the photoreceptor."

It includes the phytochrome system comprising phytochromes A and B (phyA and phyB) as the major components. phyA differs from phyB by several properties, including its ability to mediate all three photoresponse modes - the very low and low fluence responses (VLFR and LFR respectively) and the high irradiance responses (HIR), whereas phyB is responsible for LFR. This review discusses the uniqueness of phyA in terms of its structural and functional heterogeneity. The photoreceptor is presented in monocots and dicots by two native molecular species, phyA' and phyA'', differing by spectroscopic, photochemical and phenomenological properties. phyA differentiation into substates includes post-translational phosphorylation of a serine residue(s) at the N-terminal extension of the molecule with phyA' being the phosphorylated species and phyA'', dephosphorylated. They differ also by their mode of action, which depends on the cellular context. The current working hypothesis is that phyA' mediates VLFR and phyA'', HIR and LFR. The content and functional activity of the two pools are regulated by light and by phosphatase/kinase equilibrium and pH in darkness, what contributes to the fine-tuning of the phytochrome system. Detection of the native pools of the cryptogamic plant fern Adiantum capillus-veneris phy1 (phy1' and phy1'') similar to those of phyA suggests that the structural and functional heterogeneity of phyA is not a unique phenomenon and may have arisen earlier in the molecular evolution of the phytochrome system than the appearance of the angiosperm phytochromes."

The recessive srr1 null allele and phyB mutants display a number of similar phenotypes indicating that SRR1 is required for normal phyB signaling. Genetic analysis suggests that SRR1 works both in the phyB pathway but also independently of phyB. srr1 mutants are affected in multiple outputs of the circadian clock in continuous light conditions, including leaf movement and expression of the clock components, CCA1 and TOC1. Clock-regulated gene expression is also impaired during day-night cycles and in constant darkness. The circadian phenotypes of srr1 mutants in all three conditions suggest that SRR1 activity is required for normal oscillator function.

In this study, eighteen materials were collected in Potamogeton from China and incongruence was shown between the rbcL and ITS phylogenies. To solve the discrepancy, we employed a novel barcode PHYB to improve resolution and accuracy of the phylogenetic relationships. The PHYB phylogeny successfully resolved the incongruence between the rbcL and ITS phylogenies. In addition, six hybrids were confirmed using PHYB, including P. compressus × P. pusillus, P. octandrus × P. oxyphyllus, P. gramineus × P. lucens, P. distinctus × P. natans, P. distinctus × P. wrightii, and S. pectinata × S. amblyophylla. Whereas, only one hybrid was identified (P. compressus × P. pusillus) by ITS, indicating that ITS homoplasy was present in Potamogeton and ITS was completely homogenized to one parental lineage. Thus, ITS might have limited utility for phylogenetic relationships in Potamogeton. It is recommended that a three-locus combination of chloroplast DNA gene, ITS and PHYB is potential to effectively reveal more robust phylogenetic relationships and species identification."

In maize (Zea mays), TB1 is a dosage-dependent inhibitor of axillary meristem progression, and the expression level of TB1 is a sensitive measure of axillary branch development. To further explore the mechanistic basis of branching, the expression of branching and cell cycle-related genes were examined in phyB-1 and wild-type sorghum axillary buds following treatment with low-red : far-red light and defoliation. Although defoliation inhibited bud outgrowth, it did not influence the expression of sorghum TB1 (SbTB1), whereas changes in SbMAX2 expression, a homolog of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) branching inhibitor MAX2, were associated with the regulation of bud outgrowth by both light and defoliation.

Further analysis showed that PhyB interacts with phytochrome-interacting factor-like 15 (PIL15), brassinazole resistant 1 (BZR1), and vascular plant one-zinc-finger 2 (VOZ2). Plants overexpressing PIL15 were more susceptible to ShB in contrast to bzr1-D-overexpressing plants compared with the wild-type, suggesting that PhyB may inhibit BZR1 to negatively regulate rice resistance to ShB. Although BZR1 is known to regulate brassinosteroid (BR) signalling, the observation that BR signalling negatively regulated resistance to ShB indicated an independent role for BZR1 in controlling rice resistance. It was also found that the BZR1 ligand NAC028 positively regulated resistance to ShB. RNA sequencing showed that cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 8B (CAD8B), involved in lignin biosynthesis was upregulated in both bzr1-D- and NAC028-overexpressing plants compared with the wild-type. Yeast-one hybrid, ChIP, and transactivation assays demonstrated that BZR1 and NAC028 activate CAD8B directly.

Therefore, as a first step toward determining the molecular genetic basis of photoperiodic ecotypes in trees, we characterized the phytochrome gene (PHY) family in black cottonwood. We recovered fragments of one PHYA and two PHYB using PCR-based cloning and by screening a genomic library. Results from Southern analyses confirmed that black cottonwood has one PHYA locus and two PHYB loci, which we arbitrarily designated PHYB1 and PHYB2. Phylogenetic analyses which included PHY from black cottonwood, Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) suggest that the PHYB/D duplications in these species occurred independently. When Southern blots were probed with PHYC, PHYE, and PHYE heterologous probes, the strongest bands that we detected were those of black cottonwood PHYA and/or PHYB. These results suggest that black cottonwood lacks members of the PHYC/F and PHYE subfamilies. Although black cottonwood could contain additional PHY that are distantly related to known angiosperm PHY, our results imply that the PHY family of black cottonwood is less complex than that of other well-characterized dicot species such as Arabidopsis and tomato. Based on Southern analyses of five black cottonwood genotypes representing three photoperiodic ecotypes, substantial polymorphism was detected for at least one of the PHYB loci but not for the PHYA locus.

To identify genes that mediate control of development by light, we screened for suppressors of the long hypocotyl phenotype caused by a phyB mutation. Genetic analyses show that the shy (short hypocotyl) mutations we have isolated fall in several loci. Phenotypes of the mutants suggest that some of the genes identified have functions in control of light responses. Other loci specifically affect cell elongation or expansion."

The specificity of these antibodies has been tested by cross-reactivity against purified pea light-labile type 1 and light-stable type 2 phytochromes, with some antibodies reacting with the type 2 and none with the type 1 phytochromes. One such antibody, monoclonal mAT1, has been employed to analyze the phytochrome molecular species present in a photomorphogenic long hypocotyl (lh) mutant of cucumber. The results indicated that the mutant contains wild-type levels of the light-labile type 1 phytochrome polypeptide (PHYA), which has an apparent molecular mass of approximately 120 kD, but shows less than 1% (detection limit) of a light-stable polypeptide recognized by mAT1 in wild-type seedlings. This protein, not detectable in the lh mutant, has the properties of light-stable type 2 phytochrome, has an apparent molecular mass of 116 to 117 kD, and remains at constant levels under continuous low-fluence-rate red light. Therefore, we conclude that the lh mutant lacks at least one type 2 phytochrome-like polypeptide, most probably a phyB gene product. The correlation between the lack of this protein and the deficiency or absence of physiological responses to a light-stable phytochrome species in this mutant helps to identify the physiological roles played by the products of different subfamilies within the phytochrome gene family."

Here we show that nighttime temperatures affect the growth of the hypocotyl of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings not only during the night but also during the subsequent photoperiod. Active phytochrome B (phyB) represses nighttime growth and warm temperatures reduce active phyB via thermal reversion. The function of PHOTOPERIODIC CONTROL OF HYPOCOTYL1 (PCH1) is to stabilise active phyB in nuclear bodies but, surprisingly, warmth reduces PCH1 gene expression and PCH1 stability. When phyB was active at the beginning of the night, warm night temperatures enhanced the levels of nuclear phyB and reduced hypocotyl growth rate during the following day. However, when end-of-day far-red light minimised phyB activity, warm night temperatures reduced the levels of nuclear phyB and enhanced the hypocotyl growth rate during the following day. This complex growth pattern was absent in the phyB mutant. We propose that temperature-induced changes in the levels of PCH1 and in the size of the physiologically relevant nuclear pool of phyB amplify the impact of phyB-mediated temperature sensing."

This can be accounted for by the decreased response to red light (R) of the hypocotyl elongation rate in these mutants. Responses to other wavelengths are unaffected in the mutants. When grown in white light, mature hlg mutants are not elongated with respect to the wild-type; they also bolt and flower later. The shade-avoidance responses to red/far red ratio (R:FR) are intact in these mutants. Both mutants are deficient in phyB-like polypeptide that is immunodetectable in the wild-type; both have wild-type levels of a phyA-like polypeptide. These alleles are inherited in a partially dominant manner, and correspond to single-base missense mutations in a gene highly homologous to N. tabacum PHYB, which codes for a phytochrome B-type photoreceptor. One allele, hlg-1, has an introduced amino acid substitution; this may define a residue essential for phytochrome protein stability. The other allele, hlg-2, has a stop codon introduced C-terminal to the chromophore binding domain. As these phyB mutants are unaffected in shade-avoidance responses, but deficient in perception of R, it is concluded that the phyB absent in these mutants is responsible for R perception in the N. plumbaginifolia seedling, but is not a R:FR sensor in light-grown plants."

Multiple photoreceptors and transcription factors (TFs) are involved in the molecular regulation of photomorphogenesis. Likewise, light can also modulate the outcome of plant-virus interactions since both photosynthesis and many viral infection events occur in the chloroplast. Despite the apparent association between photosynthesis and virus infection, little is known about whether there are also interplays between photomorphogenesis and plant virus resistance. Recent research suggests that plant-virus interactions are potentially regulated by several photoreceptors and photomorphogenesis regulators, including phytochromes A and B (PHYA and PHYB), cryptochromes 2 (CRY2), phototropin 2 (PHOT2), the photomorphogenesis repressor constitutive photomorphogenesis 1 (COP1), the NAM, ATAF, and CUC (NAC)-family TF ATAF2, the Aux/IAA protein phytochrome-associated protein 1 (PAP1), the homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) TF HAT1, and the core circadian clock component circadian clock associated 1 (CCA1). Particularly, the plant growth promoting brassinosteroid (BR) hormones play critical roles in integrating the regulatory pathways of plant photomorphogenesis and viral defense. Here, we summarize the current understanding of molecular mechanisms linking plant photomorphogenesis and defense against viruses, which represents an emerging interdisciplinary research topic in both molecular plant biology and virology."

Upon exposure to light illumination, plants trigger a burst of molecular and physiological signaling cascades that induces not only photomorphogenic responses but also diverse adaptive behaviors. Notably, light responses and photomorphogenic traits are often associated with plant responses to other environmental cues, such as heat, cold, drought, and herbivore and pathogen attack. Growing evidence in recent years demonstrate that the red/far-red light-absorbing phytochrome (phy) photoreceptors, in particular phyB, play an essential role in plant adaptation responses to abiotic and biotic tensions by serving as a key mediator of information flow. It is also remarkable that phyB mediates the plant priming responses to numerous environmental challenges. In this minireview, we highlight recent advances on the multifaceted role of phyB during plant environmental adaptation. We also discuss the biological relevance and efficiency of the phy-mediated adaptive behaviors in potentially reducing fitness costs under unfavorable environments."

Following light-induced nuclear translocation, photoactivated phy molecules bind to and induce rapid phosphorylation and degradation of phy-interacting basic Helix Loop Helix (bHLH) transcription factors (PIFs), such as PIF3, thereby regulating the expression of target genes. However, the mechanisms underlying the signal-relay process are still not fully understood. Here, using mass spectrometry, we identify multiple, in vivo, light-induced Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites in PIF3. Using transgenic expression of site-directed mutants of PIF3, we provide evidence that a set of these phosphorylation events acts collectively to trigger rapid degradation of the PIF3 protein in response to initial exposure of dark-grown seedlings to light. In addition, we show that phyB-induced PIF3 phosphorylation is also required for the known negative feedback modulation of phyB levels in prolonged light, potentially through codegradation of phyB and PIF3. This mutually regulatory intermolecular transaction thus provides a mechanism with the dual capacity to promote early, graded, or threshold regulation of the primary, PIF3-controlled transcriptional network in response to initial light exposure, and later, to attenuate global sensitivity to the light signal through reductions in photoreceptor levels upon prolonged exposure."

During this process, excessive protein synthesis overwhelms the protein-folding ability of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causing ER stress. Although crosstalk between light signaling and ER stress response has been reported in plants, the molecular mechanisms underlying this crosstalk are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB) induces the expression of ER luminal protein chaperones as well as that of unfolded protein response (UPR) genes. The phyB-5 mutant was less sensitive to tunicamycin (TM)-induced ER stress than were the wild-type plants, whereas phyB-overexpressing plants displayed a more sensitive phenotype under white light conditions. ER stress response genes (BiP2 and BiP3), UPR-related bZIP transcription factors (bZIP17, bZIP28, and bZIP60), and programmed cell death (PCD)-associated genes (OXI1, NRP1, and MC8) were upregulated in phyB-overexpressing plants, but not in phyB-5, under ER stress conditions. The ER stress-sensitive phenotype of phyB-5 under red light conditions was eliminated with a reduction in photo-equilibrium by far-red light and darkness. The N-terminal domain of phyB is essential for signal transduction of the ER stress response in the nucleus, which is similar to light signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that phyB integrates light signaling with the UPR to relieve ER stress and maintain proper plant growth."

Each of these organisms uses a transcriptionally regulated negative feedback loop in which the messenger RNA levels of the clock components cycle over a 24-h period. Proteins containing PAS domains are invariably found in at least one component of the characterized eukaryotic clocks. Here we describe ADAGIO1 (ADO1), a gene of Arabidopsis thaliana that encodes a protein containing a PAS domain. We found that a loss-of-function ado1 mutant is altered in both gene expression and cotyledon movement in circadian rhythmicity. Under constant white or blue light, the ado1 mutant exhibits a longer period than that of wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings, whereas under red light cotyledon movement and stem elongation are arrhythmic. Both yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding studies show that there is a physical interaction between ADO1 and the photoreceptors CRY1 and phyB. We propose that ADO1 is an important component of the Arabidopsis circadian system."

Here, we characterize one mutant, out of phase 1 (oop1), with the circadian phenotype of altered phase. That is, the timing of the peak (acrophase) of multiple circadian rhythms (leaf movement, CO(2) assimilation, and LIGHT-HARVESTING CHLOROPHYLL a/b-BINDING PROTEIN transcription) is early with respect to wild type, although all circadian rhythms retain normal period length. This is the first such mutant to be characterized in Arabidopsis. oop1 also displays a strong photoperception defect in red light characteristic of phytochrome B (phyB) mutants. The oop1 mutation is a nonsense mutation of PHYB that results in a truncated protein of 904 amino acids. The defect in circadian phasing is seen in seedlings entrained by a light-dark cycle but not in seedlings entrained by a temperature cycle. Thus, PHYB contributes light information critical for proper determination of circadian phase."

There are five distinct phytochromes in Arabidopsis thaliana, designated phytochrome A (phyA) to phyE. phyA is light-labile and is the primary photoreceptor responsible for mediating photomorphogenic responses in FR light, whereas phyB-phyE are light stable, and phyB is the predominant phytochrome regulating de-etiolation responses in R light. Phytochromes are synthesized in the cytosol in their inactive Pr form. Upon light irradiation, phytochromes are converted to the biologically active Pfr form, and translocate into the nucleus. phyB can enter the nucleus by itself in response to R light, whereas phyA nuclear import depends on two small plant-specific proteins FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 1 (FHY1) and FHY1-LIKE (FHL). Phytochromes may function as light-regulated serine/threonine kinases, and can phosphorylate several substrates, including themselves in vitro. Phytochromes are phosphoproteins, and can be dephosphorylated by a few protein phosphatases. Photoactivated phytochromes rapidly change the expression of light-responsive genes by repressing the activity of CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting several photomorphogenesis-promoting transcription factors for degradation, and by inducing rapid phosphorylation and degradation of Phytochrome-Interacting Factors (PIFs), a group of bHLH transcription factors repressing photomorphogenesis. Phytochromes are targeted by COP1 for degradation via the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway."

Although many ubiquitinated proteins are targeted for degradation, SUMOylation does not necessary lead to the degradation of the modified protein but lead to the regulation of various physiological responses. SUMOylation of the examined protein cannot simply be monitored by immunoblotting techniques performed on total protein extracts, due to the SUMO-specific signals derived from other modified molecules. Furthermore, the fact that only a limited fraction of the target protein pool is SUMOylated makes the detection of SUMOylated proteins challenging.
