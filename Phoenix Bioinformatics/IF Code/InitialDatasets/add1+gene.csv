Adducin participates in oocytes chromosome meiosis of mice, prompting adducin has an effect on embryonic development. Adducin gene mutation has significantly functional change. So the present study was to identify and characterize polymorphisms within the coding region of the bovine ADD1 gene among different cattle breeds. Here, 11 novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs 1-11) were identified by DNA sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-single stranded conformational polymorphism, there were one synonymous mutation in exon 1 (SNP1); four missense mutations in exons 4, 7, and 8 (SNPs 3-6); and six mutations in introns 4, 12, 13, and 14 (SNPs 2, 7-10). The statistical analyses indicated that the some SNPs are associated with the growth traits (body length, body height, chest circumference, and hucklebone width) in Chinese Jiaxian cattle population. Our results provide evidence that polymorphisms in the ADD1 gene are associated with growth traits, and may be used for marker-assisted selection in beef cattle breeding program."

Using the bisulphite pyrosequencing technology, DNA methylation levels of five CpG dinucleotides on ADD1 promoter were measured among 33 EH cases and 28 healthy controls. Significantly higher ADD1 DNA methylation levels were observed in the females than in the males (CpG1: P = 0.016; CpG2-5: P = 0.021). A breakdown analysis by gender showed that lower CpG1 methylation was associated with an increased risk of EH in females (adjusted P = 0.042). A much more significant association between lower CpG2-5 methylation levels and the increased risk of EH was found in males (adjusted P = 0.008). CpG1 methylation was inversely correlated with age in females (r = -0.407, P = 0.019) but not in males. ADD1 CpG1 and CpG2-5 methylation levels were significantly lower in post-menopausal (>50 years) women than pre-menopausal (≤50 years) women (CpG1: P = 0.006; CpG2-5: P = 0.034). A significant interaction between CpG1 methylation and age was found in females (CpG1*age: P = 0.029). CpG2-5 methylation was shown as a significant predictor of EH in males [area under curve (AUC) = 0.855, P = 0.001], in contrast that CpG1 methylation was a trend toward indicator in females (AUC = 0.699, P = 0.054). In addition, significant differences were observed between males and females for alanine aminotransferase (ALT, P = 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, P = 0.005) and uric acid (P<0.001). The concentration of AST was inversely correlated with ADD1 CpG2-5 methylation levels in female controls (r = -0.644, P = 0.024).

Congenic strains were developed by introgressing Add1, Add2, and Add3 genes (and chr14, chr4, and chr1 associated segments) of MHS in the Milan normotensive rat (MNS) genetic background (MNS.H-Add1, MNS.H-Add2, and MNS.H-Add3) and vice versa (MHS.N-Add1, MHS.N-Add2, and MHS.N-Add3). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) of MNS.H-Add1 rats was significantly higher (+10 mmHg) than that of MNS, whereas SBP of MHS.N-Add1 was significantly lower (-10 mmHg) than that of MHS. The differences account for 43% of the blood pressure differences between MHS and MNS. In contrast, SBPs of Add2 and Add3 congenic strains were not different from those of the correspondent recipient parental strain. The fine mapping of chr14 congenic segment supports the identity of blood pressure QTL with Add1 gene."

It is now well established that in the liver, glucose is the main activator of the expression of this group of genes, with insulin having only a permissive role. While ADD1/SREBP-1 has been implicated in lipogenic gene expression through temporal association with food intake and ectopic gain-of-function experiments, no genetic evidence for a requirement for this factor in glucose-mediated gene expression has been established. We show here that the transcription of ADD1/SREBP-1c in primary cultures of hepatocytes is controlled positively by insulin and negatively by glucagon and cyclic AMP, establishing a link between this transcription factor and carbohydrate availability. Using adenovirus-mediated transfection of a powerful dominant negative form of ADD1/SREBP-1c in rat hepatocytes, we demonstrate that this factor is absolutely necessary for the stimulation by glucose of L-pyruvate kinase, fatty acid synthase, S14, and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase gene expression. These results demonstrate that ADD1/SREBP-1c plays a crucial role in mediating the expression of lipogenic genes induced by glucose and insulin."

The amino acid change found for rs4961 is from glycine to tryptophan, i.e., from an alkyl amino acid to an aromatic amino acid. This residual change is observed in the coiled region of the protein and is also predicted to be disordered by computational algorithm. Protein disorder plays an important role in structural and functional genomics. Hence, because of the complete change in side chains of the amino acid residues occurring in the coiled and disordered region of the protein, the structure of the protein might be altered and the function might be affected, leading to the risk for hypertension."

To investigate the biological role of ADD1, we expressed wild-type and dominant negative forms of this protein with retroviral vectors in preadipocytes and nonadipogenic cells. A dominant-negative form of ADD1 with a point mutation in the DNA-binding domain sharply represses the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells as observed morphologically or by the expression of adipocyte-specific mRNAs. When NIH-3T3 cells ectopically expressing ADD1 are cultured under hormonal conditions not favoring differentiation, they do not overtly differentiate but still activate expression of mRNAs for fatty acid synthase (FAS) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), two key genes that regulate fatty acid metabolism. Under culture conditions permissive for differentiation including a PPAR activator, 15%-20% of the cells expressing ADD1 undergo adipogenesis while 2%-3% of cells containing a control vector differentiate. Simultaneous expression of ADD1 with PPARgamma increases the transcriptional activity of this adipogenic nuclear hormone receptor, suggesting involvement of ADD1 in this pathway. These data indicate that ADD1 plays an important role in fat cell gene expression and differentiation, and suggest that it may function by augmenting a step in PPARgamma-mediated transcription."

In fat and liver tissues, ADD1/SREBP1c is a key transcription factor to mediate insulin-dependent regulation of gene expression. Although transcriptional and proteolytic activation of ADD1/SREBP1c has been studied intensively, the mechanism by which insulin regulates expression of its target genes with ADD1/SREBP1c at the chromatin level is unclear. Here, we reveal that SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling factors interact with the ADD1/SREBP1c and actively regulate insulin-dependent gene expression. Insulin enhanced recruitment of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling factors to its target gene promoters with concomitant changes in the chromatin structures as well as gene expression. Furthermore, in vivo overexpression of BAF155/SRG3, a component of the SWI/SNF complex, substantially promoted insulin target gene expression and insulin sensitivity. Taken together, our results suggest that the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes confer not only insulin-dependent gene expression but also insulin sensitivity in vivo via interaction with ADD1/SREBP1c."

Overexpression of upstream activators of MAP kinases, like MEKK1 or MEK1, demonstrated that ADD1/SREBP-1c-mediated effects of insulin and PDGF might be linked to the MAP kinase cascade. The recombinant N-terminal domain of ADD1/SREBP-1c was phosphorylated predominantly on serine and slightly on threonine residues by MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 in vitro.

However, little is known about transcription factors involved in such responses in higher organisms. We show here that gene expression in adipose tissue for adipocyte determination differentiation dependent factor (ADD) 1/sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) 1, a basic-helix-loop-helix protein that has a dual DNA-binding specificity, is reduced dramatically upon fasting and elevated upon refeeding; this parallels closely the regulation of two adipose cell genes that are crucial in energy homeostasis, fatty acid synthetase (FAS) and leptin. This elevation of ADD1/SREBP1, leptin, and FAS that is induced by feeding in vivo is mimicked by exposure of cultured adipocytes to insulin, the classic hormone of the fed state. We also show that the promoters for both leptin and FAS are transactivated by ADD1/SREBP1. A mutation in the basic domain of ADD1/SREBP1 that allows E-box binding but destroys sterol regulatory element-1 binding prevents leptin gene transactivation but has no effect on the increase in FAS promoter function. Molecular dissection of the FAS promoter shows that most if not all of this action of ADD1/SREBP1 is through an E-box motif at -64 to -59, contained with a sequence identified previously as the major insulin response element of this gene.

Glucose up-regulates the transcription of the fatty acid synthase gene in both adipocytes and hepatocytes, with insulin having only an indirect role. The signal metabolite could be glucose-6-phosphate rather than glucose itself. The glucose response element of the fatty acid synthase gene has not yet been precisely identified, although a -2 kb region of the fatty acid synthase promoter is sufficient to confer nutritional responsiveness to a reporter gene. ADD1/SREBP1, a b-HLH-LZ transcription factor belonging to the sterol regulatory element-binding protein family might be involved in the transduction of the glucose effect. Finally, the stimulatory effect of glucose on the expression of the fatty acid synthase gene is inhibited by the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase. Interestingly enough, AMP-activated protein kinase is structurally and functionally related to the yeast SNF1 protein kinase complex which is essential for the transcriptional activation of glucose-repressed genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae."

Because insulin stimulates carbohydrate and lipid synthesis, it would be important to decipher how the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c is regulated in the insulin signaling pathway. In this study, we demonstrated that glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c. GSK3 inhibitors enhanced a transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c and expression of ADD1/SREBP1c target genes including fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and steroyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) in adipocytes and hepatocytes. In contrast, overexpression of GSK3beta down-regulated the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c. GSK3 inhibitor-mediated ADD1/SREBP1c target gene activation did not require de novo protein synthesis, implying that GSK3 might affect transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c at the level of post-translational modification. Additionally, we demonstrated that GSK3 efficiently phosphorylated ADD1/SREBP1c in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, these data suggest that GSK3 inactivation is crucial to confer stimulated transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c for insulin-dependent gene expression, which would coordinate lipid and glucose metabolism."

The ability of ADD1/SREBP1c to activate the PGC1alpha promoter exhibited a striking cell type dependency, suggesting that additional cell type-restricted factors contribute to ADD1/SREBP1c-mediated activation.

Previous physiological studies have shown that salt sensitivity is associated with insulin resistance, enhancement of sympathetic nerve activity and decrease of blood pressure decline at night. We have been examining the genetic importance of candidate gene polymorphisms of salt-sensitive hypertension using several populations. The angiotensinogen gene (AGT) is a thrifty gene which increases the risk for common disease with growth of civilization via sodium and body fluid retention. The CC genotype of the AGT/T+31C polymorphism, which is in complete linkage disequilibrium with the TT genotype of the M235T polymorphism, was associated with a decrease of blood pressure decline at night in the Ohasama Study. On the other hand, the Gly460Trp genotype of the alpha-adducin gene (ADD1) is associated with erythrocyte sodium transport and increases tubular sodium reabsorption and risk for hypertension. We also revealed in the Ohasama Study that the Trp460 allele of ADD1 is associated with hypertension in young subjects with low renin activity. In addition to these polymorphisms, the T(-344)C polymorphism in the promoter of the aldosterone synthase gene (CYP11B2) and the C825T polymorphism of the G-protein beta3 subunit gene (GNB3) are considered candidates for the genetic risk of salt-sensitive hypertension. We compared the allele frequency of five candidate genes between Japanese and Caucasians; the results showed that the frequencies of all alleles were significantly higher in Japanese than in Caucasians. This interesting finding might suggest a feasible explanation for the huge interracial differences in the frequency of salt-sensitive hypertension."

ADD1 mRNA is expressed predominantly in brown adipose tissue in vivo and is regulated during both determination and differentiation of cultured adipocyte cell lines. ADD1 can function as a sequence-specific transcriptional activator in that it stimulates expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase vector containing multiple ADD1 binding sequences but is unable to activate the myosin light-chain enhancer, which contains multiple binding sites for another bHLH factor, MyoD. ADD1 can also activate transcription through a binding site present in the 5'-flanking region of the fatty acid synthetase gene which is expressed in a differentiation-dependent manner in adipose cells. These data suggest that ADD1 plays a role in the regulation of determination- and differentiation-specific gene expression in adipocytes."

To identify cellular proteins that associate with ADD1/SREBP1c, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system with an adipocyte cDNA library. Using the N-terminal domain of ADD1/SREBP1c as bait, we identified Twist2 (also known as Dermo-1), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein, as a novel ADD1/SREBP1c interacting protein. Over-expression of Twist2 strongly repressed the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c, primarily by reducing its binding to target sequences. Inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity with HDAC inhibitors relieved this repression. Our data suggest that physical interaction between Twist2 and ADD1/SREBP1c attenuates transcriptional activation by ADD1/SREBP1c by inhibiting its binding to DNA, and that this inhibition is at least partly dependent on chromatin modification by HDACs."

Epidemiological and genetic studies of humans and animals provide strong evidence of a causal relationship between high salt intake and hypertension. Adducin is one of the important candidate genes for essential hypertension. Adducin is a heterodimeric or heterotetrameric protein that consists of α, β, and γ subunits; the three subunits are encoded by genes (ADD1, ADD2, and ADD3) that map to three different chromosomes. Animal model experiments and clinical studies suggest that changes in single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at part of the adducin family gene increase the Na+-K+-ATPase activity of the renal tubular basement membrane and increase the reabsorption of Na+ by renal tubular epithelial cells, which may cause hypertension.

Gel mobility-shift assays performed with in vitro-translated ADD1, Id2 or Id3 proteins and a fatty acid synthase (FAS) promoter oligonucleotide showed evidence for a marked inhibition of the formation of DNA-ADD1 complexes by Id2 or Id3 proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation studies using in vitro-translated proteins demonstrated further the physical interaction of Id and ADD1/SREBP-1c proteins in the absence of DNA. Using the FAS gene as a model of an ADD1-regulated promoter in transiently transfected isolated rat adipocytes or mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, a potent inhibition of the activity of the FAS-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene was observed by overexpression of Id2 or Id3. Reciprocally, co-transfection of Id3 antisense and ADD1 expression vectors in preadipocytes potentiated the ADD1/SREBP-1c effect on the FAS promoter activity. Finally, in the non adipogenic NIH-3T3 cell line, most of the ADD1-mediated trans-activation of the FAS promoter was counteracted by co-transfection of Id2 or Id3 expression vectors. Previous studies have indicated Id gene expression to be down-regulated during adipogenesis [Moldes, Lasnier, Fève, Pairault and Djian (1997) Mol. Cell. Biol. 17, 1796-1804].

Association studies examining the relationship between polymorphism at ADD1 codon 460 (G460W) and both hypertension and blood pressure, which were performed in a variety of human population samples derived from different genetic backgrounds, have given inconsistent results. We examined the association between the ADD1 G460W polymorphism and variation in blood pressure in a sample of non-diabetic, largely normotensive Canadian Oji-Cree from an isolated community in Northern Ontario. Among 481 Oji-Cree subjects, we measured blood pressure and related clinical phenotypes and determined genotypes of ADD1 G460W. We observed an allele frequency of 0.08 for the ADD1 W460 variant, which is among the lowest so far observed in human populations. We found significant associations between variation in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and gender, age, body mass index (BMI), and treatment for hypertension. However, we found no association between the ADD1 W460 allele and increased blood pressure, nor did we observe a higher frequency of the W460 allele in a hypertensive subgroup compared with normotensive subjects. While the low sample frequency of ADD1 W460 is consistent with the low sample prevalence of hypertension, the absence of a specific association with both blood pressure and hypertension suggests that the ADD1 W460 variant is not an important determinant of blood pressure among individuals of this genetic background."

We previously delineated a region in the fatty-acid synthase promoter, which was responsible for obesity-related overexpression of the fatty-acid synthase (FAS) gene, by negatively regulating the activity of the downstream promoter in lean but not obese rat fat cells. The present study aimed to identify the transcriptional factors acting on this target region. First, functional analysis of mutated FAS promoter constructs in transiently transfected lean and obese rat adipocytes showed that the activity of the obesity-related region relied on the presence of a transcriptionally inactive sterol regulatory element at -150, which counteracted activation through the downstream E-box. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a dominant negative form of adipocyte determination and differentiation factor 1 (ADD1) was used to neutralize endogenous ADD1/ sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcriptional activity in fat cells, by producing inactive dimers unable to bind target DNA. With this system, we observed that overexpression of FAS in obese rat adipocytes was ADD1/SREBP-dependent. SREBP isoforms expression was assessed in lean and obese rat fat cells and showed no differences in the level of ADD1/SREBP1 mRNA. In addition, equivalent amounts of immunoreactive ADD1/SREBP1 were found in nuclear extracts from lean and obese rat fat cells. In contrast, immunoreactive SREBP2, which was very low in nuclear extracts from lean rats, was induced in obese rat fat cells. Finally, using in vitro binding studies, we showed that SREBP2 was able to displace ADD1/SREBP1 binding from the sterol regulatory element (SRE) site. Thus, we propose a mechanism for obesity-related overexpression of FAS gene in rat adipocyte. ADD1/SREBP1-activated transcription proceeding from the E-box motif is counterbalanced by a negative SRE site acting by limiting the availability of ADD1/SREBP1 in normal fat cells. The negative effect of this site is abolished in obese rat adipocyte nuclei where SREBP2 is induced and can substitute for ADD1/SREBP1 binding to the inactive SRE. These results provide evidence for the implication of SREBPs in the dysregulation of adipocyte metabolism characteristic of the obese state."

On the other hand, mutations in genes coding elements of particular signaling pathway can cause similar disorders (mutations in different components of RAS-MAPK pathway cause such disorders as Noonan syndrome, LEOPARD syndrome, Costello syndrome and CFC).

Previous genetic studies have nominated hundreds of genes linked to hypertension, and renal and cognitive diseases. Some have been advanced as candidate genes by showing that they can alter blood pressure or renal and cerebral vascular function in knockout animals; however, final validation of the causal variants and underlying mechanisms has remained elusive. This review chronicles 40 years of work, from the initial identification of adducin (ADD) as an ACTIN-binding protein suggested to increase blood pressure in Milan hypertensive rats, to the discovery of a mutation in ADD1 as a candidate gene for hypertension in rats that were subsequently linked to hypertension in man. More recently, a recessive K572Q mutation in ADD3 was identified in Fawn-Hooded Hypertensive (FHH) and Milan Normotensive (MNS) rats that develop renal disease, which is absent in resistant strains. ADD3 dimerizes with ADD1 to form functional ADD protein. The mutation in ADD3 disrupts a critical ACTIN-binding site necessary for its interactions with actin and spectrin to regulate the cytoskeleton. Studies using Add3 KO and transgenic strains, as well as a genetic complementation study in FHH and MNS rats, confirmed that the K572Q mutation in ADD3 plays a causal role in altering the myogenic response and autoregulation of renal and cerebral blood flow, resulting in increased susceptibility to hypertension-induced renal disease and cerebral vascular and cognitive dysfunction."

",10(10) ,(Oct. 1996). ,9121491; ,,"ADD1 is a recently identified basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper-type transcription factor that acts as a positive regulator of adipocyte-specific gene expression. Since adipocytes may share their precursor with osteoblasts, we examined the expression of ADD1 mRNA in osteoblast-like cells. In osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, the level of the ADD1 mRNA expression was low at the early period of cultures while it subsequently increased with time up to more than 10-fold in the later period of cultures along with the expression of alkaline phosphatase, a differentiation marker of these cells. In ROS17/2.8 cells, which represent mature osteoblasts, ADD1 mRNA was expressed constitutively. Treatment with retinoic acid (RA) enhanced the ADD1 mRNA expression several fold in these cells within 4 h in a dose-dependent manner. This RA effect on the ADD1 mRNA expression was blocked by dichloro-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole but not by cycloheximide. RA treatment did not affect the ADD1 mRNA stability, suggesting the involvement of transcriptional control. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that proteins in the crude nuclear extracts prepared from ROS17/2.8 cells were bound to the E box-containing ADD1 recognition DNA sequence, E/C, and that this binding activity was enhanced by the RA treatment. Neither the E2A protein recognition sequence nor the Myo-D/E12 recognition sequence competed against the E/C sequence for the binding, indicating the sequence specificity of the binding activity. Furthermore, RA treatment enhanced the transactivation activity of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct containing the E/C sequence in the transient transfection assay in ROS17/2.8 cells. RA treatment also enhanced the ADD1 mRNA expression in another rat calvaria-derived cell line, RCT1, and in the primary cultures of newborn rat calvaria cells. Overexpression of ADD1 in ROS17/2.8 enhanced the level of the osteocalcin mRNA expression. These results indicated that the adipogenic basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper-type transcription factor (ADD1) mRNA was expressed in osteoblastic cells and that its expression was associated with the expression of an osteoblastic phenotype-related gene."

Progesterone exerts lipogenic effects on adipocytes, and FAS is highly induced in breast tumor cell lines upon progesterone treatment. We show here that progesterone up-regulates ADD1/SREBP1c expression in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line and the primary cultured preadipocyte from rat parametrial adipose tissue. In MCF7, progesterone induced ADD1/SREBP1c and Metallothionein II (a well known progesterone-regulated gene) mRNAs, with comparable potency. In preadipocytes, progesterone increased ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA dose-dependently, but not SREBP1a or SREBP2. Run-on experiments demonstrated that progesterone action on ADD1/SREBP1c was primarily at the transcriptional level. The membrane-bound and mature nuclear forms of ADD1/SREBP1 protein accumulated in preadipocytes cultured with progesterone, and FAS induction could be abolished by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a dominant negative form of ADD1/SREBP1 in these cells. Finally, in the presence of insulin, progesterone was unable to up-regulate ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA in preadipocytes, whereas its effect was restored after 24 h of insulin deprivation. Together these results demonstrate that ADD1/SREBP1c is controlled by progesterone, which, like insulin, acts by increasing ADD1/SREBP1c gene transcription. This provides a potential mechanism for the lipogenic actions of progesterone on adipose tissue."

Analysis of genetic variation has the potential to improve our understanding of determinants of antihypertensive drug response in order to individualize drug selection. Genetic variation can influence both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms underlying variation in drug response. Classic pharmacogenetic investigations have identified variations in single genes that have a large effect on antihypertensive drug metabolism and are inherited in a Mendelian fashion. These include a polymorphism in the CYP2D6 gene, encoding a cytochrome p450 family member involved in phase I drug metabolism, and polymorphisms in genes encoding enzymes involved in phase II drug metabolism, including N-acetyltransferase (NAT2), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and phenol sulfotransferase (P-PST, SULT1A1). Although these polymorphisms have major effects on the pharmacokinetic profiles of both commonly used antihypertensive drugs such as metoprolol (CYP2D6), and lesser used drugs such as hydralazine (NAT2), methyldopa (COMT), and minoxidil (SULT1A1), they have not been shown to influence variation in the antihypertensive effect of these drugs at conventional doses. Interest is now focused on identifying genetic polymorphisms that influence the pharmacodynamic determinants of antihypertensive response. Using a candidate gene approach, such polymorphisms have been identified in genes encoding alpha-adducin (ADD1), subunits of G-proteins (GNB3 and GNAS1), the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3), and components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (angiotensinogen [AGT], angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE], the angiotensin type I receptor [AGTR1], and aldosterone synthase [CYP11B2]). These polymorphisms have been shown to influence the BP response to diuretics (ADD1, GNB3, NOS3, and ACE), beta-blockers (GNAS1 and ADRB1), ACE inhibitors (AGT, ACE, and AGTR1), angiotensin receptor blockers (ACE and CYP11B2), and clonidine (GNB3).An emerging consensus from these studies is that single gene effects on antihypertensive drug responses are small, and even the combined effects of all presently known polymorphisms do not account for enough variation in response to be clinically useful. New genome-wide scanning techniques may lead to the identification of genes previously unsuspected of influencing drug response. Additional requirements for pharmacogenetic approaches to become clinically useful are the characterization of the effects of haplotypes and multi-locus genotypes on drug response, and consideration of gene-by-environment interactions. Such studies will require huge sample sizes and novel statistical methods, but the theoretical and technical framework is in place to make this possible."

We found that (1) the gene for ADD1/SREBP-1c maps to a region of rat Chromosome 10 previously reported to contain a quantitative trait locus involved in the regulation of hepatic cholesterol levels and (2) the SHR harbors a valine-to-methionine substitution in the COOH terminal portion of the ADD1/SREBP-1 protein that is not present in 44 other strains of laboratory rats.

The ADD1/SREBP1 consensus E-box site is similar to a regulatory sequence designated the carbohydrate response element, defined by its ability to regulate transcription in response to carbohydrate in genes involved in fatty acid and triglyceride metabolism in liver and fat. When expressed in fibroblasts, ADD1/SREBP1 activates transcription through both the carbohydrate response E-box element and SRE-1. Substitution of an atypical tyrosine in the basic region of ADD1/SREBP1 to an arginine found in most bHLH protein causes a restriction to only E-box binding. Conversely, substitution of a tyrosine for the equivalent arginine in another bHLH protein, upstream stimulatory factor, allows this factor to acquire a dual binding specificity similar to that of ADD1/SREBP1. Promoter activation by ADD1/SREBP1 through the carbohydrate response element E box is not sensitive to the tyrosine-to-arginine mutation, while activation through SRE-1 is completely suppressed. These data illustrate that ADD1/SREBP1 has dual DNA sequence specificity controlled by a single amino acid residue; this dual specificity may provide a novel mechanism to coordinate different pathways of lipid metabolism."

All but 19 of the genes in these two sets were different. Among the 19 overlapping genes, five were found to show discordant responses between HOSE and OVCA cell lines. The five genes are those that encode clone 5.1 RNA-binding protein (RNPS1), erythrocyte adducin alpha subunit (ADD1), plexin A3 (PLXNA3 or the SEX gene), nuclear protein SkiP (SKIIP), and Rap-2 (rap-2).

The estrogen effects was observed within 6-18 h of treatment. In silicon analyses revealed presence of estrogen response elements in the proximal promoters of all five genes. RNPS1, ADD1, and PLXNA3 were underexpressed in OVCA cell lines compared to HOSE cell lines, while the opposite was true for rap-2 and SKIIP. Functional studies showed that RNPS1 and ADD1 exerted multiple antitumor actions in OVCA cells, while PLXNA3 only inhibited cell invasiveness. In contrast, rap-2 was found to cause significant oncogenic effects in OVCA cells, while SKIIP promotes only anchorage-independent growth. In sum, gene profiling data reveal that (1) E2 exerts different actions on HOSE cells than on OVCA cells by affecting two distinct transcriptomes with few overlapping genes and (2) among the overlapping genes, a set of putative oncogenes/tumor suppressors have been identified due to their differential responses to E2 between the two cell types.

The most important transcription factors involved in this process are the gamma form of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR gamma) and the various members of the CCAAT enhancer binding proteins (alpha, beta, and delta). In addition to PPAR gamma and these enhancer binding proteins, several other transcription factors, including ADD-1 (SRE-BP), HMGI-C, are involved in regulating this process. Altered activity and/or expression of these transcription factors, will induce the expression of target genes in the differentiating cells, ultimately resulting in the phenotypical characteristics of the adipocytes. It is speculated that modulation of these transcription factors by either pharmacological or dietary manipulations might influence adipocyte differentiation and prove beneficial in the prevention and treatment of obesity."

The most common form, essential hypertension, results from the complex interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental influences. Epidemiological, migration, intervention and genetic studies in humans and animals provide very strong evidence of a causal link between high salt intake and high blood pressure. One of the candidate genes for salt-sensitive hypertension is adducin. Adducin is a heterodimeric cytoskeleton protein, the three subunits of which are encoded by genes (ADD1, ADD2 and ADD3) that map to three different chromosomes. A long series of parallel studies in the Milan hypertensive rat strain model of hypertension and humans indicated that an altered adducin function might cause hypertension through enhanced constitutive tubular sodium reabsorption. An example of a prospective efficacy of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics is the detection and impact of adducin polymorphisms on hypertension. In particular, the selective advantages of diuretics in preventing myocardial infarction and stroke over other antihypertensive therapies that produce a similar blood pressure reduction in carriers of the mutated adducin may support new strategies aimed at optimizing the use of new antihypertensive agents for the prevention of hypertension-associated organ damage."

Although similar to genetic features of DNA for their heritability, epigenetic mechanisms differ for their potential reversibility by environmental and nutritional factors, which make them potentially crucial for their role in complex and multifactorial diseases. The function of these mechanisms is indeed gaining interest in relation to arterial hypertension (AH) with emerging evidence from cell culture and animal models as well as human studies showing that epigenetic modifications have major functions within pathways related to AH. Among epigenetic marks, the role of DNA methylation is mostly highlighted given the primary role of this epigenetic feature in mammalian cells. A lower global methylation was observed in DNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of hypertensive patients. Moreover, DNA hydroxymethylation appears modifiable by salt intake in a Dahl salt-sensitive rat model. The specific function of DNA methylation in regulating the expression of AH-related genes at promoter site was described for hydroxysteroid (11-beta) dehydrogenase 2 (HSD11B2), somatic angiotensin converting enzyme (sACE), Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), angiotensinogen (AGT), α-adducin (ADD1), and for other crucial genes in endocrine hypertension. Post-translational histone methylation at different histone 3 lysine residues was also observed to control the expression of genes related to AH as lysine-specific demethylase-1(LSD1), HSD11B2, and epithelial sodium channel subunit α (SCNN1A). Noncoding RNAs including several microRNAs influence genes involved in steroidogenesis and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway. In the present review, the current knowledge on the relationship between the main epigenetic marks and AH will be presented, considering the challenge of epigenetic patterns being modifiable by environmental factors that may lead toward novel implications in AH preventive and therapeutic strategies."

Adducin is primarily responsible for the assembly of spectrin-actin network that provides physical support to the plasma membrane and mediates signal transduction in various cellular physiological processes upon regulation by protein kinase C-dependent and calcium/calmodulin-dependent pathways. Abnormal phosphorylation, genetic variations, and alternative splicing of adducin may contribute to alterations in cellular functions involved in pathogenic processes. These alterations are associated with a wide range of diseases including cancer. This paper begins with a discussion on how adducin partakes in the structural formation of membrane skeleton, its regulation, and related functional characteristics, followed by a review on the pathogenesis of hypertension, biliary atresia, and cancer with respect to increased disease susceptibility mediated by adducin polymorphism and/or dysregulation. Given the functional diversity of adducin in different cellular compartments, we aim to provide a knowledge base whereby its pathophysiological roles can be better understood. More importantly, we aim to provide novel insights that may be of significance in turning the adducin model to clinical application."

PAD prevalence was defined by an ankle-brachial index, ie, the ratio of ankle systolic blood pressure to brachial artery systolic blood pressure, of </=0.90 for men and </=0.85 for women. CHD incidence was determined by following the ARIC cohort for a median of 5.3 years for potential coronary events. Stratified random samples of the ARIC cohort (n=703 and n=684) were used, respectively, as the comparison groups for the PAD (n=144) and incident CHD (n=408) cases. The GNB3 825T allele and the ADD1 460W allele were not significantly associated with prevalence of PAD or incidence of CHD.

Our laboratory and others have shown that Ngb overexpression protects neurons against hypoxia/ischemia, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent studies demonstrate that hypoxia/ischemia induces a multitude of spatially and temporally regulated responses in gene expression, and initial evidence suggested that Ngb might function in altering biological processes of gene expression. In this study, we asked how Ngb may help regulate genes responsive to hypoxia. Expression of hypoxic response genes following oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) was examined using mRNA arrays in neuroglobin-overexpressing transgenic (Ngb-Tg) and wild type (WT) mouse neurons. From a total of 113 genes on the microarray, mRNA expression of 65 genes was detected. Under rest condition, 14 genes were downregulated in Ngb-Tg neurons compared to WT. In WT neurons, after 4-h OGD followed by 4-h reoxygenation (O4/R4), 20 genes were significantly downregulated, and only Fos mRNA was significantly increased. However, out of the 20 downregulated genes in WT neurons, 12 of them were no longer significantly changed in Ngb-Tg neurons: Add1, Arnt2, Camk2g, Cstb, Dr1, Epas1, Gna11, Hif1a, Il6st, Khsrp, Mars and Rara. Among these 12 genes, 8 (Add1, Camk2g, Cstb, Dr1, Epas1, Gna11, Hif1a, Khsrp) were already reduced in Ngb-Tg neurons compared to WT under rest conditions. Additionally, three genes that initially showed no changes in WT neurons (Ctgf, Egfr and Pea15) were downregulated after OGD in the Ngb-Tg neurons. These findings suggest that Ngb overexpression modulates mRNA expression of multiple hypoxic response genes in the early phase after OGD/reoxygenation. Further studies on these gene networks and interactions may lead to better understanding of Ngb in signaling pathways that contribute to neuroprotection."

The first control level is the regulation of the expression of PPARgamma. Examples of this regulation, during adipogenesis, is the transactivation of the PPARgamma promoter by transcription factors of the classical pathway, such as C/EBPs or ADD1/SREBP1, but also newly identified factors, such as E2Fs. When preadipocytes re-enter the cell cycle, PPARgamma expression is induced coincident with an increase in DNA synthesis, suggesting the involvement of the E2F family of cell cycle regulators. E2F1 induces PPARgamma transcription during clonal expansion, whereas E2F4 represses PPARgamma expression during terminal adipocyte differentiation. Hence, E2Fs represent the link between proliferative signaling pathways, triggering clonal expansion, and terminal adipocyte differentiation through regulation of PPARgamma expression. A second regulatory level of PPARgamma action is interaction with cofactors. We will focus our attention on the atypical PPARgamma modulators. We have described an interaction between PPARgamma and the retinoblastoma protein, RB, which is both dependent upon ligand binding by PPARgamma and upon the phosphorylation status of RB. The interaction between PPARgamma and RB decreases the transcriptional activity of PPARgamma through recruitment of the histone deacetylase HDAC3. Inhibition of HDAC activity consequently results in a strong activation of PPARgamma."

S726-phosphorylated ADD1 localizes to centrosomes, wherein it organizes into a rosette-like structure at the pericentriolar material. ADD1 depletion causes centriole splitting and therefore results in multipolar spindles during mitosis, which can be restored by re-expression of ADD1 and the phosphomimetic S726D mutant but not by the S726A mutant. Moreover, the phosphorylation of ADD1 at S726 is crucial for its interaction with TPX2, which is essential for spindle pole integrity.

We have previously reported that sterol depletion in vivo caused a significant induction of both liver mRNA and enzyme activity of Dhcr7 (Bae, S.-H., Lee, J. N., Fitzky, B. U., Seong, J., and Paik, Y.-K. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 14624-14631). In this paper, we also observed liver cell-specific sterol-mediated Dhcr7 gene induction in vitro by sterol depletion in rat hepatoma cells, suggesting the presence of sterol-mediated regulatory elements in the Dhcr7 gene. To understand the mechanisms responsible for regulating Dhcr7 expression, we have isolated the 5'-flanking region of the gene encoding rat Dhcr7 and have characterized the potential regulatory elements of the gene that are responsible for sterol-mediated regulation. The Dhcr7 promoter contains binding sites for Sp1 (at -177, -172, -125, and -20), NF-Y (at -88 and -51), and SREBP-1 or ADD1 (at -33). Deletion analysis of the Dhcr7 gene promoter (-1053/+31), employing a nested series of Dhcr7-luciferase constructs, demonstrated that the -179 upstream region of the gene is necessary and sufficient for optimal efficient sterol-regulated transcription. DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that the SRE1/E box (-33/-22) involved in sterol response of many sterol-related enzyme genes was protected specifically by the overexpressed recombinant ADD1. Mutational analysis for the functional relationship between the identified cis-elements in this region indicate that one of the binding sites for Sp1 (GC box at -125) and NF-Y (CCAAT box at -88) plays a cooperative role in the sterol-mediated activation, in which the latter site also acts as a co-regulator for SREBP-activated Dhcr7 promoter activity. We believe that Dhcr7 is the first enzyme characterized with a sterol-regulatory function in the post-lanosterol pathway. This may be important for understanding the coordinated control of cholesterol biosynthesis as well as the molecular mechanism of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome-related protein in mammals."

The increase in GPAT mRNA levels that occurs during differentiation is partially prevented by ectopic expression of a dominant negative form of ADD1. Nucleotide sequences corresponding to the proximal promoter of the murine mitochondrial GPAT gene (Jerkins, A. A., Liu, W. R., Lee, S., and Sul, H. S. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 1416-1421) bound SREBP-1a and NF-Y in electromobility shift assays. In addition, GPAT promoter-luciferase reporter genes were stimulated by co-expression of SREBP-1a. This increase was attenuated when either a dominant negative form of NF-Y was co-transfected into the cells or when the GPAT promoter contained mutations in the putative binding sites for SREBP-1a or NF-Y. These studies demonstrate that the regulated expression of the mitochondrial GPAT gene requires both NF-Y and ADD1/SREBPs. Thus, SREBPs/ADD1 regulate not only genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis and fatty acid synthesis but also a key enzyme in glycerolipid synthesis."

Because cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) is also a central transcriptional activator of adipocyte differentiation, we evaluated CREB to determine if it stimulates adiponectin gene expression. To accomplish this, we evaluated the effects of activated CREB on the promoter activity of the mouse adiponectin gene, and identified the cAMP-response element (CRE) in the promoter. The constitutively active form of CREB increased the promoter activity of the mouse adiponectin gene. In addition, transfection studies using 5' serial deleted promoters revealed the presence of a putative CRE located between the -1250 and -1000bp region. Furthermore, an electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis demonstrated that CREB bound to the region between -1022 and -995 in the adiponectin promoter. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), which activate CREB, increased the adiponectin promoter activity. However, this stimulation was prevented by the dominant negative form of CREB (ACREB) and pretreatment with PD098059, indicating that IGF-1 stimulate adiponectin expression through CREB phosphorylation via the ERK pathway. Importantly, the transactivation of adiponectin expression by CREB was inhibited by ATF3. Coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assay revealed that ATF3 bound to CREB and prevented CREB phosphorylation induced during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that CREB is a positive regulator of mouse adiponectin gene expression in adipocytes, which play an important role in the regulation of adiponectin expression in response to growth factor."

Here we investigate the mechanism responsible for increased FAS gene transcription by Ang II. We demonstrate that Ang II increased luciferase activity by 3-fold in 3T3-L1 adipocytes transfected with fusion constructs linking the FAS promoter to the luciferase reporter gene. Interestingly, we mapped the Ang II regulatory sequences to the insulin-responsive region (E box) in the proximal FAS promoter. The E box alone was able to mediate Ang II responsiveness when linked to a heterologous promoter. However, this response was lost when mutations that abolished the binding of the E box to its transcription factors were introduced. Using adenoviral overexpression of a dominant-negative form of adipocyte determination and differentiation factor 1 (ADD1), a transcription factor that binds to the insulin-responsive E box, we demonstrated that ADD1 was required for Ang II regulation of the FAS gene in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, ADD1 expression was also up-regulated by Ang II. With the use of transfections as well as glucose transport assays, we further demonstrated that Ang II stimulation of the FAS gene was dependent on glucose. In conclusion, this is the first report that Ang II regulates adipocyte FAS gene transcription via insulin response sequences in a glucose-dependent manner and that this regulation is mediated at least in part via the ADD1 transcription factor."

An example of a prospective efficacy of pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomics is the detection and impact of adducin polymorphism on hypertension. Adducin is a heterodimeric cytoskeleton protein, the three subunits of which are encoded by genes (ADD1, ADD2, and ADD3) that map to three different chromosomes. A long series of parallel studies in the Milan hypertensive rat strain model of hypertension and humans indicated that an altered adducin function might cause hypertension through an enhanced constitutive tubular sodium reabsorption. In particular, six linkage studies, 18 of 20 association studies, and four of five follow-up studies that measured organ damage in hypertensive patients support the clinical impact of adducing polymorphism. As many modulatory genes and environment affect the adducin activity, the context must be taken into account to measure the clinical effect size of adducins. Pharmacogenomics is giving an important contribution to this end. In particular, the selective advantages of diuretics in preventing myocardial infarction and stroke over other antihypertensive therapies that produce a similar BP reduction in carriers of the mutated adducin may support new strategies that aim to optimize the use of antihypertensive agents for the prevention of hypertension-associated organ damage."

Taken the advantages of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we investigated α-adducin (add-1) in aversive olfactory associative learning and memory. Loss of add-1 function selectively impaired short- and long-term memory without causing acquisition, sensory, or motor deficits. We showed that α-adducin is required for consolidation of synaptic plasticity, for sustained synaptic increase of AMPA-type glutamate receptor (GLR-1) content and altered GLR-1 turnover dynamics. ADD-1, in a splice-form- and tissue-specific manner, controlled the storage of memories presumably through actin-capping activity. In support of the C. elegans results, genetic variability of the human ADD1 gene was significantly associated with episodic memory performance in healthy young subjects. Finally, human ADD1 expression in nematodes restored loss of C. elegans add-1 gene function. Taken together, our findings support a role for α-adducin in memory from nematodes to humans. Studying the molecular and genetic underpinnings of memory across distinct species may be helpful in the development of novel strategies to treat memory-related diseases."

Therefore, we investigated whether LPL gene expression is controlled by changes in cellular cholesterol concentration and determined the molecular pathways involved. Cholesterol depletion of culture medium resulted in a significant induction of LPL mRNA in the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line, whereas addition of cholesterol reduced LPL mRNA expression to basal levels. Similar to the expression of the endogenous LPL gene, the activity of the human LPL gene promoter was enhanced by cholesterol depletion in transient transfection assays, whereas addition of cholesterol caused a reversal of its induction. The effect of cholesterol depletion upon the human LPL gene promoter was mimicked by cotransfection of expression constructs encoding the nuclear form of SREBP-1a, -1c (also called ADD-1) and SREBP-2. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated the presence of 3 potential sterol regulatory elements (SRE) and 3 ADD-1 binding sequences (ABS), also known as E-box motifs. Using a combination of in vitro protein-DNA binding assays and transient transfection assays of reporter constructs containing mutations in each individual site, a sequence element, termed LPL-SRE2 (SRE2), was shown to be the principal site conferring sterol responsiveness upon the LPL promoter. These data furthermore underscore the importance of SRE sites relative to E-boxes in the regulation of LPL gene expression by sterols and demonstrate that sterols contribute to the control of triglyceride metabolism via binding of SREBP to the LPL regulatory sequences."

In the experiments reported here, we localized the human S1P gene to chromosome 16q24 by fluorescent in situ hybridization and radiation-hybrid mapping, and determined its genomic structure. This gene is more than 60 kb long and contains 23 exons and 22 introns. Its transcription-initiation site within exon 1 is separate from the initiation codon in exon 2. Analysis of the exon/intron structure revealed that the S1P gene consists of a mosaic of functional units: exon 1 encodes the 5' non-translated region; exon 2 encodes the NH2-terminal signal sequence; and exons 2 and 3 encode the pro-peptide sequence that is released when S1P is self-activated by intramolecular cleavage. Exons 5-10 encode the subtilisin-homology domain that is critical for catalytic activity, and exon 23 encodes the transmembrane region. Analysis of the putative promoter region revealed a highly G/C-rich region containing a binding site for ADD1/SREBP-1, as well as Sp1 and AP2 sites. Therefore, expression of the S1P gene may be under the control of SREBP-1, a key regulator of the expression of genes essential for intracellular lipid metabolism. Our data establish a basis for investigations to detect molecular variants in this gene that may alter levels of plasma lipoproteins and/or otherwise disrupt intracellular lipid metabolism."
