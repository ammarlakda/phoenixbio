This function is crucial for both antiviral immunity and the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. An Ets family transcription factor, i.e., Spi-B (which is highly expressed in pDCs) is required for TLR7/9 signal-induced type I IFN production and can transactivate IFN-α promoter in synergy with IFN regulatory factor-7 (IRF-7). Herein, we analyzed how Spi-B contributes to the transactivation of the Ifna4 promoter. We performed deletion and/or mutational analyses of the Ifna4 promoter and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and observed an Spi-B binding site in close proximity to the IRF-7 binding site. The EMSA results also showed that the binding of Spi-B to the double-stranded DNA probe potentiated the recruitment of IRF-7 to its binding site. We also observed that the association of Spi-B with transcriptional coactivator p300 was required for the Spi-B-induced synergistic enhancement of the Ifna4 promoter activity by Spi-B. These results clarify the molecular mechanism of action of Spi-B in the transcriptional activation of the Ifna4 promoter."

Mice deficient in Spi-B exhibit reduced B cell proliferation in response to BCR cross-linking and impaired T cell-dependent immune responses. This defect is exacerbated in the presence of Spi-1 haplo-insufficiency (Spi1+/- SpiB-/-). Tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium mobilization induced by BCR engagement is diminished in Spi1+/- SpiB-/- B lymphocytes, although many key BCR signaling proteins are expressed, suggesting that Spi-1 and Spi-B regulate expression of additional, unidentified signaling molecules. We now demonstrate that expression of the adaptor protein Grap2 is impaired in Spi1+/- SpiB+/- and Spi1+/- SpiB-/- B lymphocytes. Analysis of two alternate murine Grap2 promoters revealed a functionally important Spi-1 and Spi-B DNA binding element located in the downstream promoter. Ectopic expression of Grap2 in Grap2-deficient B cells reduced the recruitment of BLNK to Igalpha and the phosphorylation of specific substrates. Regulation of BLNK recruitment was dependent upon the Grap2 proline-rich domain, while modulation of phosphorylation was dependent upon both the proline-rich and SH2 domains. These data indicate that Spi-1 and Spi-B directly regulate the expression of Grap2 and that Grap2 functions to modulate BCR signaling, but that reduced Grap2 expression is unlikely to account for the BCR signaling defects observed in Spi1+/- SpiB-/- B cells."

However, white, nonhemorrhagic pock variants arise spontaneously within wild-type (wt) populations of either virus at a frequency of about 1%, reflective of complex deletions/rearrangements in the termini of the viral DNA. A subpopulation of the RPV white-pock mutants fail to plaque on pig kidney (PK-15) cells and are referred to as host-range (hr) mutants. In the case of CPV, white-pock formation has been linked to mutations in the SPI-2 (crmA) gene. We show that five spontaneous RPV white-pock host-range mutants (RPV mu hr8sm, RPV mu hr23, RPV mu hr28, RPV mu hr30, and RPV mu hr31) each contain a SPI-2 (crmA) gene and express the crmA protein but lack instead a functional SPI-1 gene. Two other spontaneous RPV white-pock mutants, RPV mu 9 and RPV mu 12, which plaque on PK-15 cells (nonhost-range mutants) contain and express a SPI-1 gene but lack instead a functional SPI-2 gene. Targeted disruption of either the SPI-1 or SPI-2 genes of wtRPV, but only the SPI-2 gene of wtCPV, generates mutants which produce white pocks. The RPV delta SPI-1 mutant fails to plaque on PK-15 or human A549 cells, whereas the RPV delta SPI-2 mutant has a normal host range. No changes in host range compared to wtCPV for either the CPV delta SPI-1 or CPV delta SPI-2 mutants were noted. These differences in phenotypes observed between the two viruses may be reflective of either small sequence variations between the highly conserved SPI-1 or SPI-2 genes or the aggregate phenotypes provided by the other remaining genes."

However, the function of Spi-C has yet to be determined. The purpose of this study is to further examine Spi-C activity in B cell development. First, using retroviral vectors to infect PU.1(-/-) fetal liver progenitors, Spi-C was found to be inefficient at inducing cytokine-dependent proliferation and differentiation of progenitor B (pro-B) cells or macrophages relative to PU.1 or Spi-B. Next, Spi-C was ectopically expressed in fetal liver-derived, IL-7-dependent pro-B cell lines. Wild-type (WT) pro-B cells ectopically expressing Spi-C (WT-Spi-C) have several phenotypic characteristics of pre-B cells such as increased CD25 and decreased c-Kit surface expression. In addition, WT-Spi-C pro-B cells express increased levels of IgH sterile transcripts and reduced levels of expression and transcription of the FcgammaRIIb gene. Gel-shift analysis suggests that Spi-C, ectopically expressed in pro-B cells, can bind PU.1 consensus sites in the IgH intronic enhancer and FcgammaRIIb promoter. Transient transfection analysis demonstrated that PU.1 functions to repress the IgH intronic enhancer and activate the FcgammaRIIb promoter, while Spi-C opposes these activities. WT-Spi-C pro-B cells have reduced levels of dimethylation on lysine 9 of histone H3 within the IgH 3' regulatory region, indicating that Spi-C can contribute to removal of repressive features in the IgH locus. Overall, these studies suggest that Spi-C may promote B cell differentiation by modulating the activity of PU.1-dependent genes."

In this study, we present evidence that transcription of the Fli-1 gene is positively regulated by Spi-1/PU.1 in SFFV-transformed cell lines: (i) all SFFV-transformed cell lines expressing Spi-1/PU.1 are characterized by a specific pattern of Fli-1 gene transcripts initiated in the -200 region instead of position -400 as reported for F-MuLV-transformed cell lines; (ii) these Fli-1 transcripts initiated in the -200 region are downregulated in parallel with that of Spi-1/PU.1 during hexamethylenebisacetamide (HMBA) induced differentiation; and (iii) Fli-1 transcription is upregulated in SFFV cells lines following stable transfection of a Spi-1/PU.1 expression vector. Furthermore, we found by transient transfection assays that the -270/-41 region of the Fli-1 gene displays promoter activity which is transactivated by Spi-1/PU.1. This promoter is strictly dependent on the integrity of two highly conserved ETS DNA binding sites that bind the Spi-1/PU.1 protein in vitro. Finally, we show that transfection of constitutive or inducible Fli-1 expression vectors in SFFV-transformed cells inhibits their erythroid differentiation induced by HMBA. Overall, these data indicate that Fli-1 is a target gene of the Spi-1/PU.1 transcription factor in SFFV-transformed cell lines. We further suggest that deregulated synthesis of Fli-1 may trigger a common mechanism contributing to erythroleukemia induced by either SFFV or F-MuLV."

The aberrant overexpression of the Spi-1/PU.1 transcription factor leads to erythroleukemia. To determine how Spi-1 mechanistically influences the transcriptional program, we combined a ChIP-seq analysis with transcriptional profiling in cells from an erythroleukemic mouse model. We show that Spi-1 displays a selective DNA-binding that does not often cause transcriptional modulation. We report that Spi-1 controls transcriptional activation and repression partially through distinct Spi-1 recruitment to chromatin. We revealed several parameters impacting on Spi-1-mediated transcriptional activation. Gene activation is facilitated by Spi-1 occupancy close to transcriptional starting site of genes devoid of CGIs. Moreover, in those regions Spi-1 acts by binding to multiple motifs tightly clustered and with similar orientation. Finally, in contrast to the myeloid and lymphoid B cells in which Spi-1 exerts a physiological activity, in the erythroleukemic cells, lineage-specific cooperating factors do not play a prevalent role in Spi-1-mediated transcriptional activation. Thus, our work describes a new mechanism of gene activation through clustered site occupancy of Spi-1 particularly relevant in regard to the strong expression of Spi-1 in the erythroleukemic cells."

To examine the role of signal transducer and activation of transcription (STAT) proteins in the divergent regulation of these model genes after induction of APR, we evaluated the proximal promoters of the genes, focusing on STAT binding sites contained in these promoter elements. Induction of APR by turpentine injection includes activation of a STAT3 complex that can bind to a gamma-activated sequence (GAS) in the Spi 2.2 gene promoter, although the Spi 2.2 GAS site can bind STAT1 or STAT5 as well. To create an in vitro model of APR, primary hepatocytes were treated with combinations of cytokines and hormones to mimic the hormonal milieu of the whole animal after APR induction. Incubation of primary rat hepatocytes with interleukin (IL)-6, a critical APR cytokine, leads to activation of STAT3 and a 28-fold induction of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct containing the -319 to +85 region of the Spi 2.2 promoter. This suggests the turpentine-induced increase of Spi 2.2 is mediated primarily by IL-6. In contrast, although turpentine treatment reduces Spi 2.1 mRNA in vivo and IL-6 does not increase Spi 2.1 mRNA in primary rat hepatocytes, treatment of hepatocytes with IL-6 results in a 5. 4-fold induction of Spi 2.1 promoter activity mediated through the paired GAS elements in this promoter. Differential regulation of Spi 2.1 and 2.2 genes is due in part to differences in the promoters of these genes at the GAS sites. IL-6 alone fails to reproduce the pattern of rat Spi 2 gene expression that results from turpentine-induced inflammation."

The majority of the SPI-13 genes encode proteins putatively involved in bacterial metabolism, however, their functions largely remain uncharacterized. It is currently unknown if SPI-13 contributes to metabolic fitness of Salmonella and, if so, what are the metabolic substrates for the protein encoded by genes within SPI-13. We employed Phenotype Microarray (Biolog, USA) to compare the metabolic properties of SPI-13 deficient mutant (ΔSPI-13) and the WT parent strain of non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica sub sp. enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis). The results of Phenotype Microarray revealed that SPI-13 is required for efficient utilization of two micronutrients, namely, d-glucuronic acid (DGA) and tyramine (TYR), as sole sources of carbon and/or nitrogen. By systematic deletion of the individual gene(s), we identified specific genes within SPI-13 that are required for efficient utilization of DGA (SEN2977-80) and TYR (SEN2967 and SEN2971-72) as sole nutrient sources. The results show that SPI-13 mediated DGA and TYR metabolic pathways afford nutritional fitness to S. Enteritidis. Comparative genomics analysis of the SPI-13 locus from 247 Salmonella strains belonging to 57 different serovars revealed that SPI-13 genes specifically involved in the metabolism of DGA and TYR are highly conserved in Salmonella enterica. Because DGA and TYR are naturally present as metabolic byproducts in the gastrointestinal tract and other host tissues, we propose a metabolic model that shows that the role of SPI-13 mediated DGA and TYR metabolism in the nutritional fitness of Salmonella is likely linked to nutritional virulence of this pathogen."

We report here that non-tyrosine phosphorylated (NTP)-Stat1 is involved in a cooperative interaction with Spi-1/PU.1 and IRF8 to form a pre-associated, poised complex for IL1B gene induction. A double point mutation at a putative STAT binding site, which overlaps this composite Spi-1 x IRF8 site located in the LPS and IL-1 response element (LILRE), inhibited human IL1B LPS-dependent reporter activity to about 10 percent of the control wild type vector. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed stimulation-independent constitutive binding of IRF8, Spi-1 and NTP-Stat1 at the LILRE, while binding of C/EBP beta was activated at an adjacent C/EBP beta site after LPS stimulation. In contrast to Stat1, IRF8 was tyrosine phosphorylated following LPS treatment. Supporting the involvement of NTP-Stat1, LPS-induced IL1B reporter activity in monocytes was enhanced by ectopic expression of NTP-Stat1 Y701F. In contrast, co-expression of a Y211F IRF8 mutein functioned as a dominant-negative inhibitor of LPS-induced IL1B reporter activity. In vitro DNA binding using extracts from LPS-treated monocytes confirmed that the LILRE enhancer constitutively binds a trimolecular complex containing IRF8, Spi-1 and NTP-Stat1. Binding studies using in vitro-expressed proteins revealed that NTP-Stat1 enhanced the binding of Spi-1 and IRF8 to the LILRE. Co-expression of TRAF6, an LPS surrogate, with Spi-1 and IRF8 enhanced IL1B reporter activity in HEK293R cells, which was dramatically reduced when Y211F IRF8 was co-expressed. These results suggest that the rapid transcriptional induction of an important inflammatory gene is dependent upon constitutive cooperative binding of a Spi-1 x IRF8 x NTP-Stat1 complex to the LILRE, which primes the gene for immediate induction following IRF8 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of chromatin pre-associated factors like IRF8 may be an important strategy for the rapid transcriptional activation of genes involved in innate immunity."

Initial infection probably occurs in childhood. In the working model of dissemination, virus persists in the kidney and lymphoid tissues until immune suppression/modulation causes reactivation and trafficking to the brain where JCV replicates in oligodendrocytes. JCV infection is regulated through binding of host factors such as Spi-B to, and sequence variation in the non-coding control region (NCCR). Although NCCR sequences differ between sites of persistence and pathogenesis, evidence suggests that the virus that initiates infection in the brain disseminates via B-cells derived from latently infected haematopoietic precursors in the bone marrow. Spi-B binds adjacent to TATA boxes in the promoter/enhancer of the PML-associated JCV Mad-1 and Mad-4 viruses but not the non-pathogenic, kidney-associated archetype. The Spi-B-binding site of Mad-1/Mad-4 differs from that of archetype by a single nucleotide, AAAAGGGAAGGGA to AAAAGGGAAGGTA. Point mutation of the Mad-1 Spi-B site reduced early viral protein large T-antigen expression by up to fourfold. Strikingly, the reverse mutation in the archetype NCCR increased large T-antigen expression by 10-fold. Interestingly, Spi-B protein binds the NCCR sequence flanking the viral promoter/enhancer, but these sites are not essential for early viral gene expression. The effect of mutating Spi-B-binding sites within the JCV promoter/enhancer on early viral gene expression strongly suggests a role for Spi-B binding to the viral promoter/enhancer in the activation of early viral gene expression."

This study describes single cell analysis of SP1-1 bistability and epithelial cell invasion, and reports the unsuspected observation that optimal invasion of epithelial cells requires the presence of both SPI-1ON and SPI-1OFF subpopulations. The contribution of SPI-1OFF cells to optimal invasion may rely on their ability to invade epithelial cells if a SPI-1ON subpopulation is present. In fact, Salmonella SPI-1 mutants are also able to invade epithelial cells in the presence of SPI-1ON Salmonellae, a phenomenon described in the 1990's by Galán and co-workers. Invasion by SPI-1OFF cells does not seem to involve a diffusible factor. A small number of SPI-1ON cells is sufficient to endow the bacterial population with invasion capacity, a feature that may permit host colonization regardless of the bottlenecks encountered by Salmonella populations inside animals."

The transcription factor Spi-1 (also called PU.1) is necessary for expression and binds to the minimal promoter, thus providing an essential transcription activation domain (TAD). In contrast, infection by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can strongly activate il1b via the expression of immediate early (IE) viral proteins and eliminates the requirement for the upstream enhancer. Spi-1 has been circumstantially implicated as a host factor in this process. We report here the molecular basis for the direct involvement of Spi-1 in HCMV activation of il1b. Transfection of Spi-1-deficient HeLa cells demonstrated both the requirement of Spi-1 for IE activity and the need for a shorter promoter (-59 to +12) than that required in the absence of IE proteins. Furthermore, in contrast to normal, enhancer-dependent il1b expression, which absolutely requires both the Spi-1 winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA-binding domain and the majority of the Spi-1 TAD, il1b expression in the presence of IE proteins does not require the Spi-1 TAD, which plays a synergistic role. In addition, we demonstrate that a single IE protein, IE2, is critical for the induction of il1b. Protein-protein interaction experiments revealed that the wing motif within the Spi-1 wHTH domain directly recruits IE2. In turn, IE2 physically associates with the Spi-1 wing and requires the integrity of at least one region of IE2. Functional analysis demonstrates that both this region and a carboxy-terminal acidic TAD are required for IE2 function. Therefore, we propose a protein-tethered transactivation mechanism in which the il1b promoter-bound Spi-1 wHTH tethers IE2, which provides a TAD, resulting in the transactivation of il1b."

Specific pathogenicity loci, termed Salmonella pathogenicity islands, have been shown to be crucial for the invasion and survival of Salmonella within host cells. Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) harbours the genes required for the stimulation of Salmonella uptake across the intestinal epithelia of the infected host. Regulation of SPI-1 genes is complex, as invasion gene expression responds to a number of different signals, presumably signals similar to those found within the environment of the intestinal tract. As a result of our continued studies of SPI-1 gene regulation, we have discovered that the nucleoid-binding protein Fis plays a pivotal role in the expression of HilA and InvF, two activators of SPI-1 genes. A S. typhimurium fis mutant demonstrates a two- to threefold reduction in hilA:Tn5lacZY and a 10-fold reduction in invF:Tn5lacZY expression, as well as a 50-fold decreased ability to invade HEp-2 tissue culture cells. This decreased expression of hilA and invF resulted in an altered secreted invasion protein profile in the fis mutant. Furthermore, the virulence of a S. typhimurium fis mutant is attenuated 100-fold when administered orally, but has wild-type virulence when administered intraperitoneally. Expression of hilA:Tn5lacZY and invF:Tn5lacZY in the fis mutant could be restored by introducing a plasmid containing the S. typhimurium fis gene or a plasmid containing hilD, a gene encoding an AraC-like regulator of Salmonella invasion genes."

It is required for myeloid and B lymphoid differentiation. When overexpressed in mice, Spi-1 is associated with the emergence of transformed proerythroblasts unable to differentiate. In the course of a project undertaken to characterize the oncogenic function of Spi-1, we found that Spi-1 interacts with proteins of the spliceosome in Spi-1-transformed proerythroblasts and participates in alternative splice site selection. Because Spi-1 is a transcription factor, it could be hypothesized that these two functions are coordinated. Here, we have developed a system allowing the characterization of transcription and splicing from a single target. It is shown that Spi-1 is able to regulate alternative splicing of a pre-mRNA for a gene whose transcription it regulates. Using a combination of Spi-1 mutants and Spi-1-dependent promoters, we demonstrate that Spi-1 must bind and transactivate a given promoter to favor the use of the proximal 5' alternative site. This establishes that Spi-1 affects splicing decisions in a promoter binding-dependent manner. These results provide new insight into how Spi-1 may act in the blockage of differentiation by demonstrating that it can deregulate gene expression and also modify the nature of the products generated from target genes."

We now show that these two factors strongly cooperate on the il1b core promoter (-59/+12) in the absence of direct NF-IL6 binding to DNA. Transient transfection assays, using mutated il1b core promoters, showed that the Spi-1, but not the NF-IL6, binding site is absolutely required for functional cooperativity. Furthermore, the NF-IL6 transactivation domain (TAD) is functionally indispensable and more critical than that of Spi-1. Additionally, TAD-deficient NF-IL6 functions as a dominant negative for Spi-1-mediated activation, suggesting the involvement of the bZIP DNA binding domain. This is supported by the demonstration of in vitro interaction between the NF-IL6 bZIP and Spi-1 winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA binding domains, arguing that NF-IL6 vigorously activates the il1b core promoter via protein-tethered transactivation mediated by Spi-1."

Whether the repression of lon by LoiA is associated with its regulation of SPI-1 genes, as well as the regulatory mechanism involved, is unknown. In this study, we showed that LoiA directly represses the expression of the lon gene during invasion by binding to the promoter region of lon. The activation of S.

Moreover, through invasion and mouse infection assays, we found that the repression of lon by LoiA contributes to S. Typhimurium invasion of intestinal epithelial cells and virulence in mice. However, LoiA does not influence lon expression during S. Typhimurium growth in macrophages, which may be associated with the low expression level of loiA in macrophages. Collectively, these findings establish the direct regulation of lon by LoiA and describe a novel mechanism by which LoiA regulates SPI-1 gene expression."

In these cells, TPO enhanced the expression of the specific megakaryocytic marker integrin glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa while decreasing the expression of erythroid genes (Porteu, F., Rouyez, M. -C., Cocault, L., Benit, L., Charon, M., Picard, F., Gisselbrecht, S. , Souyri, M., and Dusanter-Fourt, I.

Using transient transfection assays of a series of human GPIIb promoter fragments, we delineated a TPO-responsive element within the previously reported enhancer region of the promoter. Although this enhancer included GATA- and Ets-binding sites (EBSs), we found that only EBS -514 was important for TPO response. We identified PU. 1/Spi-1 as the endogenous Ets transcription factor that strongly and preferentially interacted with this enhancer EBS. This factor did not interact with other proximal EBSs in the GPIIb promoter. We next showed that TPO induced a strong and selective increase of PU. 1/Spi-1 expression and DNA binding activity in UT7-Mpl cells. In contrast, TPO did not affect the expression of Ets-1/2 while weakly increasing the levels of Fli-1. Overexpression of PU.1/Spi-1 was further shown to enhance GPIIb promoter activity in the absence and presence of TPO. Overall, our data indicated that, in UT7-Mpl cells, TPO increased the transcriptional activity of a GPIIb gene in part due to an enhanced expression of an unexpected transcription factor, the Ets family PU.1/Spi-1 factor. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a role for the PU.1/Spi-1 factor in the regulation of megakaryocytic genes."

Spi-C was encoded by a single-copy gene that was mapped to chromosome 10, region C. Spi-C interacted with DNA similarly to PU.1 as judged by methylation interference, band-shift and site selection analysis, and activated transcription of a kappaY element reporter gene upon co-transfection of HeLa cells.

This response is poorly understood and difficult to reconcile with the view that H-NS acts mainly by blocking transcription initiation. Here we have analyzed the basis for the up-regulation of H-NS-silenced Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) in cells depleted of Rho-cofactor NusG. Evidence from genetic experiments, semiquantitative 5' rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends sequencing (5' RACE-Seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) shows that transcription originating from spurious antisense promoters, when not stopped by Rho, elongates into a H-NS-bound regulatory region of SPI-1, displacing H-NS and rendering the DNA accessible to the master regulator HilD. In turn, HilD's ability to activate its own transcription triggers a positive feedback loop that results in transcriptional activation of the entire SPI-1. Significantly, single-cell analyses revealed that this mechanism is largely responsible for the coexistence of two subpopulations of cells that either express or do not express SPI-1 genes. We propose that cell-to-cell differences produced by stochastic spurious transcription, combined with feedback loops that perpetuate the activated state, can generate bimodal gene expression patterns in bacterial populations."

The development of PML in non-immunosuppressed individuals is a growing concern with reports of mortality in patients treated with mAb therapies. JCV can persist in the kidneys, lymphoid tissue and bone marrow. JCV gene expression is restricted by non-coding viral regulatory region sequence variation and cellular transcription factors. Because JCV latency has been associated with cells undergoing haematopoietic development, transcription factors previously reported as lymphoid specific may regulate JCV gene expression. This study demonstrates that one such transcription factor, Spi-B, binds to sequences present in the JCV promoter/enhancer and may affect early virus gene expression in cells obtained from human brain tissue. We identified four potential Spi-B-binding sites present in the promoter/enhancer elements of JCV sequences from PML variants and the non-pathogenic archetype. Spi-B sites present in the promoter/enhancers of PML variants alone bound protein expressed in JCV susceptible brain and lymphoid-derived cell lines by electromobility shift assays. Expression of exogenous Spi-B in semi- and non-permissive cells increased early viral gene expression. Strikingly, mutation of the Spi-B core in a binding site unique to the Mad-4 variant was sufficient to abrogate viral activity in progenitor-derived astrocytes. These results suggest that Spi-B could regulate JCV gene expression in susceptible cells, and may play an important role in JCV activity in the immune and nervous systems."

Examination of nonpermissive human A549 cells infected with an RPV mutant disrupted in the SPI-1 gene (RPV delta SPI-1) suggests there are no gross defects in protein or DNA synthesis. The proteolytic processing of late viral structural proteins, a feature of orthopoxvirus infections associated with the maturation of virus particles, also appears relatively normal. However, very few mature virus particles of any kind are produced compared with the level found in infections with wild-type RPV. Morphological examination of RPV delta SPI-1-infected A549 cells, together with an observed fragmentation of cellular DNA, suggests that the host range defect is associated with the onset of apoptosis. Apoptosis is seen only in RPV delta SPI-1 infection of nonpermissive (A549 or PK-15) cells and is absent in all wild-type RPV infections and RPV delta SPI-2 mutant infections examined to date. Although the SPI-1 gene is expressed early, before DNA replication, the triggering apoptotic event occurs late in the infection, as RPV delta SPI-1-infected A549 cells do not undergo apoptosis when infections are carried out in the presence of cytosine arabinoside. While the SPI-2 (crmA) gene, when transfected into cells, has been shown to inhibit apoptosis, our experiments provide the first indication that a poxvirus serpin protein can inhibit apoptosis during a poxvirus infection."

Mutation of this site abrogates binding of this factor and reduces the ability of the IL1B promoter to function in macrophages. A second Spi-1 binding site located between positions -115 and -97 also is required for maximal IL1B promoter activity in the presence of the proximal Spi-1 binding site. In addition, an activation domain-deficient Spi-1 expression vector acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of reporter gene expression in a monocyte cell line. Finally, the IL1B promoter, which is inactive in Spi-1-deficient HeLa cells, is activated in these cells by cotransfection with a Spi-1 expression vector.

As a highly adapted intracellular pathogen, Salmonella enterica has acquired during its evolution various virulence genes via numerous lateral transfer events, including the acquisition of the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI-2) and its associated effectors. Beneficial use of horizontally acquired genes requires that their expression is effectively coordinated with the already existing virulence programs and the regulatory set-up in the bacterium. As an example for such a mechanism, we show here that the ancestral PhoPQ system of Salmonella enterica is able to regulate directly the SPI-2 effector gene sseL (encoding a secreted deubiquitinase) in an SsrB-independent manner and that PhoP plays a part in a feed-forward regulatory loop, which fine-tunes the cellular level of SseL. Additionally, we demonstrate the presence of conserved cis regulatory elements in the promoter region of sseL and show direct binding of purified PhoP to this region. Interestingly, in contrast to the S. enterica PhoP, an ortholog regulator from a S. bongori SARC 12 strain was found to be impaired in promoting transcription of sseL and other genes from the PhoP regulon. These findings have led to the identification of a previously uncharacterized residue in the DNA-binding domain of PhoP, which is required for the transcriptional activation of PhoP regulated genes in Salmonella spp. Collectively our data demonstrate an interesting interface between the acquired SsrB regulon and the ancestral PhoPQ regulatory circuit, provide novel insights into the function of PhoP, and highlight a mechanism of regulatory integration of horizontally acquired genes into the virulence network of Salmonella enterica."

Deletion of open reading frames (ORFs) K2, K3, and K4 within the HindIII K fragment of the HA-positive (HA+) vaccinia virus strain WR also led to fusion of cells upon infection at neutral pH. A novel ORF inactivation procedure utilizing the polymerase chain reaction was used to specifically implicate the K2 ORF in this phenomenon. The K2 ORF (the viral SPI-3 gene) encodes a protein resembling serine protease inhibitors (serpins). Inactivation of the SPI-3 gene in any of the HA+ orthopoxviruses tested caused infected cells to fuse in a manner which appeared identical to that seen for HA- mutants, although fusion was most pronounced with cowpox virus. SPI-3-negative strains fused despite the fact that the HA was expressed and processed normally, i.e., cells infected with SPI-3 mutants remained functionally hemadsorption positive, and analysis of the HA protein by Western immunoblot suggested that posttranslational modifications of the HA protein appeared normal. Fusion triggered by SPI-3 mutants, like that for HA- mutants, was inhibited by the monoclonal antibody C3 directed against the vaccinia virus 14-kDa envelope protein. Therefore SPI-3- and HA-mediated fusion share a requirement for the 14-kDa protein, suggesting linkage of the seemingly disparate SPI-3 and HA genes through a common pathway which normally acts to prevent fusion of cells infected with wild-type virus."

To improve the yield, the spiruchostatin biosynthetic gene cluster (spi) was first identified by rapid genome sequencing and characterized by genetic mutations. This spi gene cluster encodes a hybrid biosynthetic pathway similar to that encoded by the FK228 biosynthetic gene cluster (dep) in Chromobacterium violaceum No. 968. Each gene cluster contains a pathway regulatory gene (spiR vs. depR), but these two genes encode transcriptional activators of different classes. Overexpression of native spiR or heterologous depR in the wild-type strain of Pseudomonas sp.

Although sRNAs were initially found in intergenic regions, there is emerging evidence that protein coding regions of the genome are a rich reservoir of sRNAs. Here we report that the 5΄UTR of IS200 transposase mRNA (tnpA) is processed to produce regulatory RNAs that affect expression of over 70 genes in Salmonella Typhimurium. We provide evidence that the tnpA derived sRNA base-pairs with invF mRNA to repress expression. As InvF is a transcriptional activator of SPI-1 encoded and other effector proteins, tnpA indirectly represses these genes. We show that deletion of IS200 elements in S. Typhimurium increases invasion in vitro and reduces growth rate, while over-expression of tnpA suppresses invasion. Our work indicates that tnpA acts as an sRNA 'sponge' that sets a threshold for activation of Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-1 effector proteins and identifies a new class of 'passenger gene' for bacterial transposons, providing the first example of a bacterial transposon producing a regulatory RNA that controls host gene expression."

Activation of leuO transcription represses expression of pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and inhibits invasion of epithelial cells. Loss of HilE suppresses LeuO-mediated downregulation of SPI-1. Activation of leuO transcription reduces the level of HilD protein, and loss of HilE restores the wild type HilD level. Hence, LeuO-mediated downregulation of SPI-1 may involve inhibition of HilD activity by HilE, a view consistent with the fact that HilE is a HilD inhibitor. In vivo analyses using β-galactosidase fusions indicate that LeuO activates hilE transcription. In vitro analyses by slot blotting, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis and DNase I footprinting show that LeuO binds the hilE promoter region. Although residual SPI-1 repression by LeuO is observed in the absence of HilE, the LeuO-HilE-HilD 'pathway' appears to be the major mechanism. Because both leuO and SPI-1 are repressed by H-NS, activation of leuO transcription may provide a backup mechanism for SPI-1 repression under conditions that impair H-NS-mediated silencing."

The amount of ACC mRNA transcribed from PII promoter containing SRE was not significantly affected by dietary protein, while a significant decrease in PI-generated ACC mRNA content was observed in rats fed the SPI diet.

Active and passive repression mechanisms are presented. The transcription factor PU.1 actively inhibits the expression of I-A beta through the binding to a DNA sequence near the Y box, a cis-element in the promoter necessary for transcription. This interaction probably interferes with the preinitiation complex assembly. NF-Y is a transcription factor that binds to the Y box and has two constituents: NF-YA (that binds weakly to DNA) and NF-YB (that increases the binding of NF-YA to DNA). The dbpA protein represses the expression of I-A beta by a quenching mechanism, forming a complex with NF-YA and the dbpB protein by sequestering the NF-YB protein. A similar mechanism is observed with the glucocorticoid receptor that binds to the X-box binding proteins and inhibits their interaction with the X box. These results are examples of cross-talk between proteins, which may help us to understand the regulation of I-A beta gene expression."

Here it is shown that loss of SPI-4 attenuates the oral virulence of Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis in mice. Fifty percent lethal doses were elevated in both serovars upon the loss of SPI-4. Moreover, delta SPI-4 mutants were outcompeted in systemic organs by their wild-type strains in a cochallenge model. Contribution of SPI-4 to virulence appeared less pronounced in the S. Enteritidis strain, which was justified by lower levels of the secreted protein SiiE in this strain in comparison with S. Typhimurium. Competition assays with isogenic mutants lacking individual genes of the island showed that all six genes were required for full virulence of S. Typhimurium. Delta siiA and delta siiB mutants were, nevertheless, able to secrete SiiE to culture supernatants. The amount of secreted SiiE was, however, reduced in these two mutants compared with the wild-type strain. Furthermore, a down-regulation of SiiE levels is shown in structural and regulatory lipopolysaccharide mutants exhibiting the deep-rough phenotype."

As phosphorylated AI-2 binds to and inactivates LsrR, LsrR remains active and decreases expression of SPI-1 and flagella genes in the luxS mutant. The reduced expression of those genes resulted in impaired invasion of Salmonella into epithelial cells. Expression of SPI-1 and flagella genes was also reduced by overexpression of the LsrR regulator from a plasmid, but was relieved by exogenous AI-2, which binds to and inactivates LsrR.

In direct contrast to PU.1(-/-) mice that die in utero and lack monocytes, neutrophils, B cells, and T cells, Spi-B-/- mice are viable and exhibit a severe B cell proliferation defect. Since PU.1 is expressed at wild type levels in Spi-B-/- B cells, the mutant mice provide genetic evidence that SPI-B and PU.1 have at least some non-redundant roles in B lymphocytes. To begin to understand the molecular basis for these defects, we delineated functional domains of SPI-B for comparison to those of PU.1. By using a heterologous co-transfection system, we identified two independent transactivation domains in the N terminus of SPI-B. Interestingly, only one of these domains (amino acids 31-61), a proline/serine/threonine-rich region, unique among Ets proteins, is necessary for transactivation of the immunoglobulin lambda light chain enhancer. This transactivation motif is in marked contrast to PU.1, which contains acidic and glutamine-rich domains. In addition, we describe a functional PU.1 site within the c-FES promoter which SPI-B fails to bind efficiently and transactivate. Finally, we show that SPI-B interacts with the PU.1 cofactors Pip, TBP, c-Jun and with lower affinity to nuclear factor interleukin-6beta and retinoblastoma. Taken together, these data suggest that SPI-B binds DNA with a different affinity for certain sites than PU.1 and harbors different transactivation domains. We conclude that SPI-B may activate unique target genes in B lymphocytes and interact with unique, although currently unidentified, cofactors."

While these results suggest that alterations in Spi-1 expression have significant effects on erythroblast growth and differentiation, neither the cause nor the effect of the decrease in Spi-1 expression that follows Me2SO exposure has been established. The experiments described here demonstrate that the effect of inducers on Spi-1 expression is regulated post-transcriptionally.

Additionally, expression of a recombinant Spi-1 mRNA under transcriptional control of a constitutively active Rous sarcoma virus promoter was regulated identically to endogenous Spi-1 mRNA. The ability of Me2SO to destabilize Spi-1 mRNA was selective, as the stability of the erythroid transcription factors GATA-1 and NF-E2 were not similarly effected.

These stressors concertedly trigger virulence factors encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs). Although RpoS is a well-known central transcriptional stress and virulence regulator, functional information regarding the genes of the regulon is currently limited. Here, we identified SEN1538 as a conserved RpoS-regulated gene belonging to the KGG protein superfamily. We further assessed its role in pathogenic stress responses and virulence. When SEN1538 was deleted (Δ1538), the pathogen showed reduced survival during antimicrobial peptide introduction and heat stress at 55°C compared to WT.

Immunoblotting with an anti-SPI-3 antibody showed that the SPI-3 protein is synthesized early in infection prior to DNA replication. SPI-3 inhibits cell-cell fusion during infections with both CPV and vaccinia virus. A transfection assay was devised to test engineered mutants of SPI-3 for the ability to inhibit fusion. Two mutants with C-terminal deletions of 156 and 70 amino acids were completely inactive in fusion inhibition.

In situ hybridizations of adult murine tissues demonstrate Spi-B mRNA in the medulla of the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and the germinal centers of lymph nodes. Spi-B expression is very abundant in B cells and both Spi-B mRNA and protein are detected in some T cells. In situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis suggest that Spi-B gene expression increases during B cell maturation and decreases during T cell maturation.

However, in contrast to NF-IL6 and Spi-1, DNA binding activity of Oct-1, an ubiquitously expressed octamer-binding protein was not affected by Tax. Additional EMSA using in vitro translated proteins also showed that recombinant Tax enhances DNA binding of both of recombinant NF-IL6 and Spi-1 proteins. These data were supported by our glutathione S-transferase (GST)-pull-down data, which indicated that Tax physically interacts with the two proteins. Based on the results obtained from the present study, we conclude that the IL1B promoter is a Tax-responsive sequence as a result of ability of Tax to induce binding of NF-IL6 and Spi-1 to the IL1B promoter sequence through protein-protein interaction."

With a heterologous CAT gene as a reporter, the transcriptional activity of the promoter region containing both the distal (SPI) and the proximal (SPII) promoters of hepatitis B surface gene was found to show a preference for differentiated hepatoma cell lines. The SPI promoter which produces a RNA transcript for the synthesis of the large surface protein shows a strong preference, at least 750-fold, for differentiated hepatoma cells, while the SPII promoter which produces RNA transcripts for the synthesis of the middle and major surface proteins shows a moderate preference, about 20- to 59-fold. Further study indicates that this 750-fold preference of the SPI transcriptional activity for differentiated hepatoma cell lines can be attributed to the regulatory sequences of both the SPI and the HBV enhancer regions. These results also imply the important role of the large surface protein of HBV on the hepatocyte-specific infectivity of this virus."

To date, we have only found evidence for involvement of C/EBP alpha, although further experiments will be needed to exclude the role of C/EBP beta and C/EBP delta in receptor gene expression. These studies suggest a model of hematopoiesis (Fig. 2) in which the lineage commitment decisions of multipotential cells are made by the alternative patterns of expression of certain transcription factors, which then activate growth factor receptors which allow those cells to respond to the appropriate growth factor to proliferate and survive. For example, expression of GATA-1 activates its own expression, as well as that of the erythropoietin receptor, inducing these cells to be capable of responding to erythropoietin. Similarly, expression of PU.1 activates its own promoter, and turns on the three myeloid CSF receptors (M, GM, and G), pushing these cells along the pathway of myeloid differentiation. C/EBP proteins, particularly C/EBP alpha, are also critical for myeloid receptor promoter function, and may also act via autoregulatory mechanisms. Murine C/EBP alpha has a C/EBP binding site in its own promoter. Human C/EBP alpha autoregulates its own expression in adipocytes by activating the USF transcription factor. Myeloid genes expressed later during differentiation, such as CD11b, are also activated by PU.1, which is expressed at highest levels in mature myeloid cells, but not by C/EBP alpha, which is downregulated in a differentiated murine myeloid cell line. Consistent with this model are the findings that overexpression of PU.1 in erythroid cells blocks erythroid differentiation, leading to erythroleukemia, and overexpression of GATA-1 in a myeloid line blocks myeloid differentiation. While these findings have provided some framework for understanding myeloid gene regulation, there are a number of critical questions to be addressed in the near future: What is the pattern of expression of the C/EBP proteins during the course of myeloid differentiation and activation of human CD34+ cells? What is the effect of targeted disruption and other mutations of the C/EBP and AML1 proteins on myeloid development and receptor expression? What are the interactions among these three different types of factors (ets, basic region-zipper, and Runt domain proteins) to activate the promoters? What is the effect of translocations, mutations, and alterations in expression of these factors, particularly in different forms of AML?"

A major difference between these two otherwise very similar genes is the presence in spi 2.3 of a specific 348-bp extension of the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR). Inserting this 3' UTR element downstream of the polyadenylation signal or upstream of the spi 2.3 promoter in constructs containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene strongly decreases basal transcription and inhibits growth-hormone-stimulated transcription, but poorly affects transcriptional stimulation by dexamethasone or interleukin-6. The spi 2.3 3' UTR extension also inhibits, basal and growth-hormone-induced transcription from the spi 2.1 promoter. Repressor activity appears to be distributed throughout the specific extension of the 3' UTR and seems to involve interactions with two types of 5' cis-acting promoter elements. The first is the GAGA box, a key control spi promoter element, whose mutation faithfully reproduces the effects of the 3' UTR silencer on spi 2.1 and spi 2.3 promoters. The second is represented by CCAAT enhancer-binding-protein-(C/EBP)-binding sites, whose functions are severely impaired by the spi 2.3-specific 3' UTR extension. The presence of this silencer in the spi 2.3 gene very likely accounts for the lack of basal of transcription in vivo and for induction of the gene during acute inflammation."

A VV-encoded hemagglutinin (HA) has previously been demonstrated to inhibit cell-cell fusion, but fusion-promoting VVs with K2L gene deletions had normal expression and cellular location of the VV HA. As both HA and SPI-3 independently inhibit cell-cell fusion in VV-infected cells, there must be at least two fusion-promoting mechanisms encoded by VV. These may play different roles in virus-cell fusion and in cell-cell fusion after VV infection."

However, relatively little is known about how the PU.1 gene is regulated in vivo. Here it is shown that myeloid cell type-specific expression of PU.1 in stable cell lines and transgenic animals is conferred by a 91-kilobase (kb) murine genomic DNA fragment that consists of the entire PU.1 gene (20 kb) plus approximately 35 kb of upstream and downstream sequences, respectively.

A 3.5-kb fragment containing one of these deoxyribonuclease I hypersensitive sites, located -14 kb 5' of the transcriptional start site, conferred myeloid cell type-specific expression in stably transfected cell lines, suggesting that within this region is an element important for myeloid specific expression of PU.1.

O- and H-antigen specific anti-sera are commonly for slide and tube agglutination tests to identify Salmonella serovars. However, it is both labor intensive and time consuming, so there is an urgent need for a new technique for the rapid detection of the major Salmonella serovars. In this study, we developed a 1-step PCR assay to identify the serovar Gallinarum. This PCR-based assay was based on the SPUL_2693 gene, which was located in SPI-19 and found by comparing the genomes of the S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum in the whole data of NCBI. The specificity of this gene was evaluated by bioinformatics analysis, and the results showed that the SPUL_2693 gene exists in all serovar Gallinarum. The specificity and sensitivity of this PCR assay were evaluated in our study. The developed PCR assay was able to distinguish the serovar Gallinarum from 27 different Salmonella serovars and 5 different non-Salmonella pathogens. The minimum limit of genomic DNA of S.

The PCR assay properly identified the serovar Gallinarum from other Salmonella serovars, and the results were in agreement with the results of a traditional serotyping assay.

Here, we report that PU.1 mRNA is upregulated during myeloid differentiation of human purified CD34+ cells and murine multipotential FDCP-mix A4 cells, suggesting that PU.1 is upregulated as an early event during differentiation of multipotential progenitor cells. PU.1 expression is maintained at stable levels during differentiation of myeloid cell lines U937 and HL-60 to monocytic and neutrophilic cells. PU.1 is expressed at highest levels in mature human monocytes and human peripheral blood neutrophils. In contrast to PU.1, significant levels of Spi-B mRNA and protein are found only in some B-cell lines and spleen but are not found in myeloid cell lines, neutrophils, or macrophages. In vitro translated Spi-B protein can bind to PU.1 binding sites in myeloid promoters and transactivate these promoters in nonmyeloid cells. Therefore, although PU.1 and Spi-B may bind to similar DNA control elements and have redundancy of transactivation function in vitro, the lack of significant levels of Spi-B in myeloid cells makes it unlikely that Spi-B plays a significant role in myeloid lineage development and gene expression.

Recent evidence also suggests that variation in the regulatory elements of these genes and their downstream targets underlies the evolution of several segment-specific morphological traits. This review introduces a new model system, the larval oenocyte, for studying the evolution of fate specification by Hox genes at single-cell resolution. Oenocytes are found in a wide range of insects, including species using both the short and the long germ modes of development. Recent progress in our understanding of the genetics and cell biology of oenocyte development in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster is discussed. In the D. melanogaster embryo, the formation of this cell type is restricted to the first 7 abdominal segments and is under Hox gene control. Oenocytes delaminate from the dorsal ectoderm of A1-A7 in response to an induction that involves the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling pathway. Although the receptor itself is required in the presumptive oenocytes, its ligand Spitz (Spi) is secreted by a neighbouring chordotonal organ precursor (COP). Thus, in dorsal regions, local signalling from this component of the developing peripheral nervous system induces the formation of oenocytes. In contrast, in lateral regions of the ectoderm, Spi signal from a different COP induces the formation of secondary COPs in a homeogenetic manner. This dorsoventral difference in the fate induced by Spi ligand is controlled by a prepattern in the responding ectoderm that requires the Spalt (Sal) transcription factor. Sal protein is expressed in the dorsal but not lateral ectoderm and acts as a competence modifier to bias the response to Spi ligand in favour of the oenocyte fate. We discuss a recently proposed model that integrates the roles of Sal and the EGFR pathway in oenocyte/chordotonal organ induction. This model should provide a useful starting point for future comparative studies of these ectodermal derivatives in other insects."

We have shown that sustained overexpression of Spi-1/PU.1 also inhibits the erythroid splicing of protein 4.1R exon 16, irrespective of chemical induction of differentiation. Here, we show a positive feedback loop that couples constitutive phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling to high expression of Spi-1/PU.1 in Friend erythroleukemia cells. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT results in Spi-1/PU.1 downregulation in a stepwise manner and induces cell differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further supported the positive autoregulatory effect of Spi-1/PU.1. Mutational analysis indicated that Ser41, but not Ser148, is necessary for Spi-1/PU.1-mediated repression of hemoglobin expression, whereas both Ser residues are required for Spi-1/PU.1 inhibition of the erythroid splicing event.

In order to further understand the mechanisms directing the expression of these key regulators of hematopoiesis, we initiated a study investigating the transcription factors activating the expression of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor alpha gene. Here, we demonstrate that the human GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter directs reporter gene activity in a tissue-specific fashion in myelomonocytic cells, which correlates with its expression pattern as analyzed by reverse transcription PCR. The GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter contains an important functional site between positions -53 and -41 as identified by deletion analysis of reporter constructs. We show that the myeloid and B cell transcription factor PU.1 binds specifically to this site. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a CCAAT site located upstream of the PU.1 site between positions -70 and -54 is involved in positive-negative regulation of the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter activity. C/EBP alpha is the major CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) form binding to this site in nuclear extracts of U937 cells. Point mutations of either the PU.1 site or the C/EBP site that abolish the binding of the respective factors result in a significant decrease of GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter activity in myelomonocytic cells only. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in myeloid and B cell extracts, PU.1 forms a novel, specific, more slowly migrating complex (PU-SF) when binding the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter PU.1 site. This is the first demonstration of a specific interaction with PU.1 on a myeloid PU.1 binding site. The novel complex is distinct from that described previously as binding to B cell enhancer sites and can be formed by addition of PU.1 to extracts from certain nonmyeloid cell types which do not express PU.1, including T cells and epithelial cells, but not from erythroid cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the PU-SF complex binds to PU.1 sites found on a number of myeloid promoters, and its formation requires an intact PU.1 site adjacent to a single-stranded region. Expression of PU.1 in nonmyeloid cells can activate the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter. Deletion of the amino-terminal region of PU.1 results in a failure to form the PU-SF complex and in a concomitant loss of transactivation, suggesting that formation of the PU-SF complex is of functional importance for the activity of the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter. Finally, we demonstrate that C/EBP alpha can also active the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter in nonmyeloid cells.

However, data presented in this report show that in human and mouse cells the NG36 and G9a genes are predominantly expressed within a single approximately 3.9-kbp transcript. Thus, the human NG36/G9a gene contains 28 exons (4 exons from the NG36 gene and 24 exons from the G9a gene), spans 17.938 kb, and encodes a 1210-amino acid polypeptide. In addition, a splice variant (NG36G9a-SPI), which lacks exon 10, was found to be coexpressed together with the full-length NG36/G9a transcript in both human and mouse cells. To aid functional characterization of the novel NG36/G9a gene-product, T7-epitope-tagged versions of the complete NG36/G9a protein or the G9a region alone (amino acids 210 to 1210) was transiently expressed in mammalian cells. Surprisingly, the sub-cellular distribution of the NG36/G9a-T7 and G9a-T7 proteins was found to be quite distinct. Whereas the G9a-T7 protein was observed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, the NG36/G9a-T7 protein was extensively concentrated within the nucleus. Also, the G9a-T7 protein frequently appeared marginalized at the nuclear periphery, while the NG36/G9a-T7 protein was generally found throughout the nucleoplasm. As such, it would appear that the NG36 domain plays a key role in controlling the sub-cellular distribution of the NG36/G9a protein."

Fis also influences the virulence of Salmonella enterica and pathogenic E. coli by regulating their virulence genes, however, the relevant mechanism is unclear. In this report, using combined RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq technologies, we first identified 1646 Fis-regulated genes and 885 Fis-binding targets in the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, and found a Fis regulon different from that in E. coli. Fis has been reported to contribute to the invasion ability of S. enterica. By using cell infection assays, we found it also enhances the intracellular replication ability of S. enterica within macrophage cell, which is of central importance for the pathogenesis of infections. Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPI)-1 and SPI-2 are crucial for the invasion and survival of S. enterica in host cells. Using mutation and overexpression experiments, real-time PCR analysis, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrated that Fis regulates 63 of the 94 Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-1 and SPI-2 genes, by three regulatory modes: i) binds to SPI regulators in the gene body or in upstream regions; ii) binds to SPI genes directly to mediate transcriptional activation of themselves and downstream genes; iii) binds to gene encoding OmpR which affects SPI gene expression by controlling SPI regulators SsrA and HilD. Our results provide new insights into the impact of Fis on SPI genes and the pathogenicity of S. enterica."

While Hrp1 T3SSs are frequently encoded in other P. fluorescens strains, the presence of a SPI-1 T3SS in a plant-beneficial bacterial strain was unexpected. In this work, the genetic organization and expression of these two T3SS loci have been analysed by a combination of transcriptional reporter fusions and transcriptome analyses. Overexpression of two transcriptional activators has shown a number of genes encoding putative T3 effectors. In addition, the influence of these two T3SSs during the interaction of P. fluorescens F113 with some bacterial predators was also assessed.

PU.1 is upregulated early during commitment of multipotential progenitors to the myeloid lineages and inhibition of PU.1 function in human CD34+ progenitors prior to this upregulation blocks myeloid colony formation. Since PU.1 expression appears to play a role in hematopoietic development, we characterized the PU.1 promoter. Here we report that the murine PU.1 promoter, as well as the human promoter, demonstrate tissue-specific reporter gene expression in myeloid cell lines but not in T cells and HeLa (non-hematopoietic cells) cells. Deletion analysis of the PU.1 promoter indicates that tissue-specific functional elements are encoded in the -61 to -39 bp and -7 to +34 bp regions. The first region contains a functional octamer (Oct) site at -54 bp and an Sp1 site at -39 bp. The second contains a binding site at +20 bp for both PU.1 itself and the related ets family member Spi-B. In vivo footprinting assays demonstrate that a hypersensitive band was detected at the PU.1 site in myeloid cells but not in HeLa. A mutation of the PU.1 site which abolished PU.1 binding caused a significant decrease in promoter activity. Mutation of the Oct and/or Sp1 site results in a lesser decrease of promoter activity in myeloid cells. Co-transfection of PU.1 or Spi-B in cells lacking PU.1 and Spi-B specifically transactivated a minimal promoter containing the PU.1 binding site, indicating that PU.1 can activate its own promoter elements in an autoregulatory loop. Positive autoregulation of the PU.1 promoter may play an important role in the function of PU.1 in myeloid cells."

Mutational analysis of the 80 bp EBNA2 responsive cis-element within the viral bidirectional LMP/TP2 promoter region identified two sequence elements, which are both essential for transactivation by EBNA2. These sequences harbour putative consensus binding sites for Spi-1 oncoprotein and recombination signal binding protein RBP-J kappa, the homologue of Drosophila Suppressor of Hairless. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated the high affinity binding of Spi-1 and Spi-B, both members of the Ets family of transcription factors, to one sequence element. The other element bound RBP-J kappa with low affinity. In addition, co-transfections showed that the replacement of the Spi-1/Spi-B binding site in the bi-directional LMP/TP2 promoter by the analogous SV40 Spi-1 responsive element did not impair its function on EBNA2-mediated transactivation. It is concluded that the transcriptional regulators Spi-1 and Spi-B as well as RBP-J kappa play an essential role in transactivating the LMP/TP2 promoter by EBNA2 and therefore in the immortalization of B cells by EBV."

To facilitate the detection and molecular analysis of deletion mutations in vivo, we established a transgenic mouse model harboring a lambdaEG10 shuttle vector that includes the red and gam genes for Spi(-) (sensitive to P2 interference) selection [Nohmi et al. (1996] Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 28:465-470]. This selection has a great advantage over other genetic systems, because phage deletion mutants can be preferentially selected as Spi(-) plaques, which can then be subjected to molecular analysis. Here, we show nucleotide sequences of 41 junctions of deletion mutations induced by gamma-irradiation. Unlike spontaneous deletion mutants, more than half of the large deletions occurred between short homologous sequences from one to eight bp. The remaining junctions had no such homologous sequences. Intriguingly, two Spi(-) mutants had P (palindrome)-like nucleotide additions at the breakpoints, which are frequently observed in the coding junctions of V(D)J recombination, suggesting that broken DNA molecules with hairpin structures can be intermediates in the repair of radiation-induced double-strand breaks. We conclude that Spi(-) selection is useful for the efficient detection of deletion mutations in vivo and that most rearrangements induced by gamma-rays in mice are mediated by illegitimate recombination through DNA end-joining."

Using luciferase reporter assays with the set of constructs that contained a gradually truncated intron 1 of the SHP-1 gene, we identified the minimal (<120 bp) fragment that is able to fully activate expression of the reporter gene. Furthermore, we found that PU.1 (a member of the Ets transcription factor family that plays a crucial role in differentiation and function of the lymphoid and myeloid cells) binds to the identified P2 promoter both in vitro and in vivo. PU.1 also activates the promoter in the sequence specific manner and is critical for its expression as evidenced by the profound supression of the SHP-1 gene transcription upon the siRNA-mediated depletion of PU.1. These findings provide an insight into the structure of the hematopoietic cell-specific P2 promoter of the SHP-1 gene and identify PU.1 as the transcriptional activator of the P2 promoter."

Using a yeast one-hybrid screen to identify potential transcription factors of the MOR promoter, we have identified PU.1 as one of the candidate genes. PU.1 is a member of the ets family of transcription factors, expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells and microglia of brain. PU.1 plays an essential role in the development of both lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Opioids exert neuromodulatory as well as immunomodulatory effects, which are transduced by MOR. Moreover, MOR-deficient mice exhibit increased proliferation of hematopoietic cells, suggesting a possible link between the opioid system and hematopoietic development. The PU.1 protein binds to the 34-bp element of the MOR gene in a sequence-specific manner confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and supershift assays. We have also determined endogenous PU.1 interactions with the 34-bp element of MOR promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. In co-transfection studies PU.1 represses MOR promoter reporter constructs through its PU.1 binding site. When the PU.1 gene is disrupted as in PU.1 knock-out mice and using small interfering RNA-based strategy in RAW264.7 cells, the transcription of the endogenous target MOR gene is increased significantly. This increase is probably mediated through modification of the chromatin structure, as suggested by the reversal of the PU.1-mediated repression of MOR promoter activity after trichostatin A treatment in neuroblastoma NMB cells. Our results suggest that PU.1 may be an important regulator of the MOR gene, particularly in brain and immune cells."

The SPI-2 TTSS secretes the translocon components SseBCD, which translocate across the vacuolar membrane a number of effector proteins whose action is required for intracellular bacterial replication. Several of these effectors, including SifA and SifB, are encoded outside SPI-2. The two-component regulatory system SsrA-SsrB, encoded within SPI-2, controls the expression of components of the SPI-2 TTSS apparatus as well as its translocated effectors. The expression of SsrA-B is in turn regulated by the OmpR-EnvZ two-component system, by direct binding of OmpR to the ssrAB promoter. Several environmental signals have been shown to induce in vitro expression of genes regulated by the SsrA-B or OmpR-EnvZ systems. In this work, immunoblotting and flow cytometry were used to analyse the roles of SsrA-B and OmpR-EnvZ in coupling different environmental signals to changes in expression of a SPI-2 TTSS translocon component (SseB) and two effector genes (sifA and sifB). Using single and double mutant strains the relative contribution of each regulatory system to the response generated by low osmolarity, acidic pH or the absence of Ca2+ was determined. SsrA-B was found to be essential for the induction of SPI-2 gene expression in response to each of these individual signals. OmpR-EnvZ was found to play a minor role in sensing these signals and to require a functional SsrA-B system to mediate their effect on SPI-2 TTSS gene expression."

Since Spi-B and Spi-1 are very divergent in their transactivator domain, these domains might acquire functional specificity in vivo by interacting with different co-factors and/or by undergoing different phosphorylations. First, we observed that casein kinase II phosphorylates Spi-B as well as Spi-1, in vitro. Then, by affinity chromatographies and in vitro kinase assays with fusion proteins between glutathione-S-transferase and the transactivator domain of Spi-B, two kinases were identified on their ability to interact and phosphorylate this domain; the MAP kinase ERK1 and the stress activated protein kinase JNK1. The Threonine 56 was defined as the ERK1 phosphorylation site by using phosphoamino-acid analyses and a Spi-B mutant version with the substitution T56 to A56. Strikingly, ERK1 failed to phosphorylate Spi-1, in vitro, whereas JNK1, like CK II, phosphorylated Spi-B and Spi-1. In addition, other purified Spi-B-kinase activities, unidentified as yet, display similar specificity than ERK1 for Spi-B versus Spi-1. Furthermore, the evident interaction of pRb protein with the transactivator domain of Spi-B in an unphosphorylated state disappeared when this domain was first phosphorylated in vitro either by ERK1 or by the purified Spi-B-kinase activities.

Despite this 1 : 1 stoichiometry, MS revealed that IhfB is produced in 2-fold excess over IhfA. We re-engineered Salmonella to exchange reciprocally the protein-coding regions of ihfA and ihfB, such that each relocated protein-encoding region was driven by the expression signals of the other's gene. MS showed that in this 'rewired' strain, IhfA is produced in excess over IhfB, correlating with enhanced stability of the hybrid ihfB-ihfA mRNA that was expressed from the ihfB promoter. Nevertheless, the rewired strain grew at a similar rate to the wild-type and was similar in competitive fitness. However, compared to the wild-type, it was less motile, had growth-phase-specific reductions in SPI-1 and SPI-2 gene expression, and was engulfed at a higher rate by RAW macrophage.

The increase in IGF-I and serine protease inhibitor 2.1 (Spi 2.1) mRNA in GH-treated cells was inhibited by treatment with IL-6 for 24 h. To investigate potential mechanisms, we examined the effects of IL-6 on GH receptor (GHR) expression and GH signaling via the JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and MAP kinase pathways. Incubation of cells with IL-6 (10 ng/ml, 24 h) had no effect on GHR abundance or signaling proteins JAK2, STAT5b, and ERK1/2. Although GH transiently increased (2- to 5-fold) the tyrosine phosphorylation of GHR, JAK2, STAT5b, and ERK1/2, IL-6 did not alter these phosphorylation events. However, nuclear protein from IL-6-treated cells demonstrated reduced STAT5 DNA binding (by EMSA) at 15 min (-20%) and 60 min (-43%) after GH stimulation.

This reduced-host-range (hr) phenotype suggests that SPI-1 may interact with cellular and/or other viral proteins. We devised a genetic screen for suppressors of SPI-1 hr mutations by first introducing a mutation into SPI-1 (T309R) at residue P14 of the serpin reactive center loop. The SPI-1 T309R serpin is inactive as a protease inhibitor in vitro. Introduction of the mutation into RPV leads to the same restricted hr phenotype as deletion of the SPI-1 gene. Second-site suppressors were selected by restoration of growth of the RPV SPI-1 T309R hr mutant on A549 cells. Both intragenic and extragenic suppressors of the T309R mutation were identified. One novel intragenic suppressor mutation, T309C, restored protease inhibition by SPI-1 in vitro. Extragenic suppressor mutations were mapped by a new procedure utilizing overlapping PCR products encompassing the entire genome in conjunction with marker rescue. One suppressor mutation, which also rendered the virus temperature sensitive for growth, mapped to the DNA polymerase gene (E9L). Several other suppressors mapped to gene D5R, an NTPase required for DNA replication.

The ability of Salmonella to induce this rapid apoptosis was growth phase regulated and cell type restricted, with epithelial cells being resistant. Apoptosis induction was also abrogated by disruption of the hilA gene (encoding a regulator of SPI-1 genes) and by the expression of a constitutively active PhoPQ. hilA itself and a subset of SPI-1 genes were transiently expressed during aerobic growth in liquid medium. Interestingly, however, hilA was found to be required only for the expression of the prgH gene, while sipB, invA, and invF were expressed in a hilA-independent manner. The expression of SPI-1 genes and the secretion of invasion-associated proteins correlated temporally with the induction of apoptosis and are likely to represent its molecular basis.

We show that levels of protein expression are very weak under in vitro conditions and that expression is not enhanced upon the deletion of ssrB, phoP, slyA, qseC, ompR, or hfq, suggesting an unknown activating factor. These data suggest that the SPI-6 T6SS has been integrated into the Salmonella Typhimurium virulence network and customized for host-pathogen interactions through the action of noncore genes."

Houston, ","""Analysis of concentration-dependent functions of PU.1 in hematopoiesis using mouse models."", ","Blood cells, molecules & diseases ",39(3) ,(2007). ,17629523; ,,"The Ets family transcription factor PU.1, encoded by the gene Sfpi1, is essential for normal hematopoiesis. A number of studies have suggested that changes in PU.1 concentration play a role in directing cell fate decisions during hematopoiesis. However, the stages of hematopoietic development at which changes in PU.1 concentration are important have not been defined until recently. Experiments using conditional null alleles, reporter alleles, and hypomorphic alleles of the Sfpi1 gene in mice demonstrate that PU.1 concentration is uniformly high during early stages of hematopoietic development. However, reduction of PU.1 concentration is required for normal development of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors, B cell progenitors, and T cell progenitors. PU.1 concentration increases in granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. Furthermore, experimental reduction of PU.1 concentration in the myeloid lineages leads to failed differentiation, abnormal proliferation, and leukemia. In this review, we summarize recent studies to develop a new model of PU.1 function in hematopoiesis."
