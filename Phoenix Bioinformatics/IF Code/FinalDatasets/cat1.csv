0,Cancer science ,PUBMED: 33211385; ,"Copy number alterations detected by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) can lead to the identification of novel cancer-related genes. We analyzed chromosomal aberrations in a set of 100 human primary colorectal cancers (CRCs) using CGH and found a solute carrier (SLC) 7A1 gene, which encodes cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1) with 14 putative transmembrane domains, in a chromosome region (13q12.3) with a high frequency of gene amplifications. SLC7A1/CAT1 is a transporter responsible for the uptake of cationic amino acids (arginine, lysine, and ornithine) essential for cellular growth. Microarray and PCR analyses have revealed that mRNA transcribed from CAT1 is overexpressed in more than 70% of human CRC samples, and RNA interference-mediated knockdown of CAT1 inhibited the cell growth of CRCs. Rats were immunized with rat hepatoma cells expressing CAT1 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP), and rat splenocytes were fused with mouse myeloma cells. Five rat monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (CA1 ~ CA5) reacting with HEK293 cells expressing CAT1-GFP in a GFP expression-dependent manner were selected from established hybridoma clones. Novel anti-CAT1 mAbs selectively reacted with human CRC tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues according to immuno-histochemical staining and bound strongly to numerous human cancer cell lines by flow cytometry. Anti-CAT1 mAbs exhibited internalization activity, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and migration inhibition activity against CRC cell lines. Furthermore, CA2 inhibited the in vivo growth of human HT29 and SW-C4 CRC tumors in nude mice. This study suggested CAT1 to be a promising target for mAb therapy against CRCs.",1.0
1,Journal of experimental botany ,PUBMED: 17728292; ,"Catalase and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) have been extensively studied for their roles in various stress responses. However, little is known about the triggering mechanisms for stress-induced catalase gene expression or about H(2)O(2) production as a stress signal. It is reported here that ABA-, drought-, and salt stress-induced gene expression of CAT1 catalase is mediated by AtMEK1, an Arabidopsis MAPK kinase, by triggering H(2)O(2) signal production. Both CAT1 expression and AtMEK1 activity were activated by ABA, drought, and salt stresses. The mek1 mutant totally blocked stress-induced CAT1 expression and, interestingly, stress-induced H(2)O(2) production was also blocked. Over-expression of AtMEK1 significantly promoted stress-induced CAT1 expression, and also promoted H(2)O(2) production. These results conclusively indicate that stress-induced CAT1 expression is mediated by AtMEK1 and, furthermore, that the triggering of H(2)O(2) production might be involved in this process, as further proved by the observation that CAT1 expression was induced by applied H(2)O(2.) Surprisingly, the signalling mechanisms for stress-induced gene expression of CAT2 and CAT3 were very different from that of CAT1. Except for drought stress, expression of CAT2 or CAT3 was also activated by salt stress or ABA treatment, and AtMEK1 was not proved to be involved in the drought-induced expression of CAT2 or CAT3. Further studies showed that stomatal movement was much less sensitive to ABA in AtMEK1 mutant (mek1), and over-expression of AtMEK1 in Arabidopsis increased plant resistance to drought or salt stress, which further demonstrated that AtMEK1 is a crucial mediator in plant stress signal transduction.",1.0
2,Revista iberoamericana de micologia ,PUBMED: 20974273; ,"Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen that causes 90% of invasive aspergillosis (IA) due to Aspergillus genus, with a 50-95% mortality rate. It has been postulated that certain virulence factors are characteristic of A. fumigatus, but the ""non-classical"" virulence factors seem to be highly variable. Overall, published studies have demonstrated that the virulence of this fungus is multifactorial, associated with its structure, its capacity for growth and adaptation to stress conditions, its mechanisms for evading the immune system and its ability to cause damage to the host. In this review we intend to give a general overview of the genes and molecules involved in the development of IA. The thermotolerance section focuses on five genes related with the capacity of the fungus to grow at temperatures above 30°C (thtA, cgrA, afpmt1, kre2/afmnt1, and hsp1/asp f 12). The following sections discuss molecules and genes related to interaction with the host and with the immune responses. These sections include β-glucan, α-glucan, chitin, galactomannan, galactomannoproteins (afmp1/asp f 17 and afmp2), hydrophobins (rodA/hyp1 and rodB), DHN-melanin, their respective synthases (fks1, rho1-4, ags1-3, chsA-G, och1-4, mnn9, van1, anp1, glfA, pksP/alb1, arp1, arp2, abr1, abr2, and ayg1), and modifying enzymes (gel1-7, bgt1, eng1, ecm33, afpigA, afpmt1-2, afpmt4, kre2/afmnt1, afmnt2-3, afcwh41 and pmi); several enzymes related to oxidative stress protection such as catalases (catA, cat1/catB, cat2/katG, catC, and catE), superoxide dismutases (sod1, sod2, sod3/asp f 6, and sod4), fatty acid oxygenases (ppoA-C), glutathione tranferases (gstA-E), and others (afyap1, skn7, and pes1); and efflux transporters (mdr1-4, atrF, abcA-E, and msfA-E). In addition, this review considers toxins and related genes, such as a diffusible toxic substance from conidia, gliotoxin (gliP and gliZ), mitogillin (res/mitF/asp f 1), hemolysin (aspHS), festuclavine and fumigaclavine A-C, fumitremorgin A-C, verruculogen, fumagillin, helvolic acid, aflatoxin B1 and G1, and laeA. Two sections cover genes and molecules related with nutrient uptake, signaling and metabolic regulations involved in virulence, including enzymes, such as serine proteases (alp/asp f 13, alp2, and asp f 18), metalloproteases (mep/asp f 5, mepB, and mep20), aspartic proteases (pep/asp f 10, pep2, and ctsD), dipeptidylpeptidases (dppIV and dppV), and phospholipases (plb1-3 and phospholipase C); siderophores and iron acquisition (sidA-G, sreA, ftrA, fetC, mirB-C, and amcA); zinc acquisition (zrfA-H, zafA, and pacC); amino acid biosynthesis, nitrogen uptake, and cross-pathways control (areA, rhbA, mcsA, lysF, cpcA/gcn4p, and cpcC/gcn2p); general biosynthetic pathway (pyrG, hcsA, and pabaA), trehalose biosynthesis (tpsA and tpsB), and other regulation pathways such as those of the MAP kinases (sakA/hogA, mpkA-C, ste7, pbs2, mkk2, steC/ste11, bck1, ssk2, and sho1), G-proteins (gpaA, sfaD, and cpgA), cAMP-PKA signaling (acyA, gpaB, pkaC1, and pkaR), His kinases (fos1 and tcsB), Ca(2+) signaling (calA/cnaA, crzA, gprC and gprD), and Ras family (rasA, rasB, and rhbA), and others (ace2, medA, and srbA). Finally, we also comment on the effect of A. fumigatus allergens (Asp f 1-Asp f 34) on IA. The data gathered generate a complex puzzle, the pieces representing virulence factors or the different activities of the fungus, and these need to be arranged to obtain a comprehensive vision of the virulence of A. fumigatus. The most recent gene expression studies using DNA-microarrays may be help us to understand this complex virulence, and to detect targets to develop rapid diagnostic methods and new antifungal agents.",1.0
3,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America ,PUBMED: 6589635; ,"A regulatory element has been identified in maize that appears to exert an effect specifically on Cat1 gene expression in the scutellum of maize during early sporophytic development. Cat1 encodes CAT-1 catalase, one of two forms of catalase expressed in the scutellum during this developmental time period. Density-labeling experiments indicate that the regulatory element influences the overall levels of CAT-1 protein synthesis in the scutellum but has no effect on CAT-2 protein synthesis. Immunoprecipitation experiments of in vitro translation products suggest that this element has an effect on the level of translatable Cat1 mRNA associated with the scutellar polysomes. The element exhibits additive inheritance and is tissue and time specific in its action. This element, therefore, meets all the criteria of a regulatory gene and has been designated Car2. The element acts to regulate the temporal expression of the Cat1 structural locus in maize.",1.0
4,PloS one ,PUBMED: 35639710; ,"Positive and counter-selectable markers have been successfully integrated as a part of numerous genetic assays in many model organisms. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of resistance to arginine analog canavanine and its applicability for genetic selection in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Deletion of both the arginine permease gene cat1 and SPBC18H10.16/vhc1 (formerly mistakenly called can1) provides strong drug resistance, while the single SPBC18H10.16/vhc1 deletion does not have an impact on canavanine resistance. Surprisingly, the widely used can1-1 allele does not encode for a defective arginine permease but rather corresponds to the any1-523C>T allele. The strong canavanine-resistance conferred by this allele arises from an inability to deposit basic amino acid transporters on the cellular membrane. any1-523C>T leads to reduced post-translational modifications of Any1 regulated by the Tor2 kinase. We also demonstrate that any1-523C>T is a dominate allele. Our results uncover the mechanisms of canavanine-resistance in fission yeast and open the opportunity of using cat1, vhc1 and any1 mutant alleles in genetic assays.",1.0
5,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.) ",PUBMED: 35781205; ,"The availability of exceptionally strong and tightly regulated promoters is a key feature of Komagataella phaffii (syn. Pichia pastoris), a widely applied yeast expression system for heterologous protein production. Most commonly, the methanol-inducible promoter of the alcohol oxidase 1 gene (PAOX1) and the constitutive promoter of the glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gene (PGAP) have been used. Recently, also promising novel constitutive (PGCW14), regulated (PGTH1, PCAT1), and bidirectional promoters (histone promoters and synthetic hybrid variants) have been reported.As natural promoters showed so far limited tunability of expression levels and regulatory profiles, various promoter engineering efforts have been undertaken for P. pastoris . PAOX1, PDAS2, PGAP, and PGCW14 have been engineered by systematic deletion studies or random mutagenesis of upstream regulatory sequences. New engineering strategies have focused on PAOX1 core promoter modifications by random or rational approaches and transcriptional regulatory circuits to render PAOX1 independent of methanol induction. These promoter engineering efforts in P. pastoris have resulted in improved, sequence-diversified synthetic promoter variants allowing coordinated fine-tuning of gene expression for a multitude of biotechnological applications.",1.0
6,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology ,PUBMED: 10792824; ,"The mechanisms by which the maize antioxidant Cat1 gene responds to abscisic acid (ABA) and osmotic stress have been investigated. Results show that during late embryogenesis, Cat1 expression in vivo is independent of endogenous ABA levels. However, exogenously applied ABA significantly enhances Cat1 expression. Transient assays using particle bombardment show that the proximal ABRE2 element on the Cat1 promoter is responsible for the induction of Cat1 expression by ABA. We further show that ABA induces the expression of Cat1 via the interaction between ABRE2 and one of its binding proteins, CBF1 (Cat1 binding factor 1). Using ABA-deficient mutant embryos, we show that osmotic stress induces Cat1 expression through two alternate signal transduction pathways: an ABA signaling pathway leading to the interaction between the ABRE2 motif and CBF1, and a pathway via the interaction of ABRE2 and CBF2 (Cat1 binding factor 2) that is independent of ABA. The data presented clearly suggest that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays an important intermediary role in the ABA signal transduction pathway leading to the induction of the Cat1 gene.",1.0
7,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB ,PUBMED: 20347322; ,"A cDNA clone containing a catalase (CAT1) gene, designated PgCat1, was isolated from Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (Korean ginseng). PgCat1 is predicted to encode a precursor protein of 492 amino acid residues, and its sequence shares high degrees of homology with a number of other CAT1s. Genomic DNA hybridization analysis indicated that PgCat1 represents a multi-gene family. Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR results showed that PgCat1 expressed at different levels in leaves, stem, roots of P. ginseng seedlings. Different stresses, heavy metals, plant hormones, osmotic agents, high light irradiance, abiotic stresses, triggered a significant induction of PgCat1. The positive responses of PgCat1 to the various stimuli suggested that P. ginseng PgCat1 may help to protect the plant against reactive oxidant related environmental stresses.",1.0
8,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology ,PUBMED: 8220459; ,"A genomic clone containing the maize Cat1 gene has been isolated and its complete DNA sequence determined. The start of transcription has been mapped by primer extension. Six introns were identified in the Cat1 coding region. In order to determine the tissue-specific expression pattern of the Cat1 gene, promoter-reporter gene fusion constructs were made consisting of 2.5 kb and 0.8 kb of the 5' Cat1 sequence fused to the coding region of the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene. These fusion constructs were introduced into Nicotiana tabacum cv. Burley 21 and the expression of Cat1-GUS in various tissues was examined. In transgenic tobacco, the Cat1 promoter can drive GUS expression at relatively high levels in mature seeds. GUS activity starts to accumulate at about 10 days after flowering, reaching a maximum at about 22 days after flowering, and decreases thereafter, but persists until after seed desiccation through early germination. Low levels of GUS activity can be detected in pollen. This corresponds to the Cat1 expression pattern observed in maize.",1.0
9,Handbook of experimental pharmacology ,PUBMED: 24756713; ,"TRPV6 (former synonyms ECAC2, CaT1, CaT-like) displays several specific features which makes it unique among the members of the mammalian Trp gene family (1) TRPV6 (and its closest relative, TRPV5) are the only highly Ca(2+)-selective channels of the entire TRP superfamily (Peng et al. 1999; Wissenbach et al. 2001; Voets et al. 2004). (2) Translation of Trpv6 initiates at a non-AUG codon, at ACG, located upstream of the annotated AUG, which is not used for initiation (Fecher-Trost et al. 2013). The ACG codon is nevertheless decoded by methionine. Not only a very rare event in eukaryotic biology, the full-length TRPV6 protein existing in vivo comprises an amino terminus extended by 40 amino acid residues compared to the annotated truncated TRPV6 protein which has been used in most studies on TRPV6 channel activity so far. (In the following numbering occurs according to this full-length protein, with the numbers of the so far annotated truncated protein in brackets). (3) Only in humans a coupled polymorphism of Trpv6 exists causing three amino acid exchanges and resulting in an ancestral Trpv6 haplotype and a so-called derived Trpv6 haplotype (Wissenbach et al. 2001). The ancestral allele encodes the amino acid residues C197(157), M418(378) and M721(681) and the derived alleles R197(157), V418(378) and T721(681). The ancestral haplotype is found in all species, the derived Trpv6 haplotype has only been identified in humans, and its frequency increases with the distance to the African continent. Apparently the Trpv6 gene has been a strong target for selection in humans, and its derived variant is one of the few examples showing consistently differences to the orthologues genes of other primates (Akey et al. 2004, 2006; Stajich and Hahn 2005; Hughes et al. 2008). (4) The Trpv6 gene expression is significantly upregulated in several human malignancies including the most common cancers, prostate and breast cancer (Wissenbach et al. 2001; Zhuang et al. 2002; Fixemer et al. 2003; Bolanz et al. 2008). (5) Male mice lacking functional TRPV6 channels are hypo-/infertile making TRPV6 one of the very few channels essential for male fertility (Weissgerber et al. 2011, 2012).",1.0
10,Biochemical and biophysical research communications ,PUBMED: 11676491; ,"The aniline-assimilating bacterium Acinetobacter lwoffii K24 has two cat gene clusters (cat1 and cat2). In this study, we completely sequenced 10-kb DNA fragment of cat1 genes of A. lwoffii K24, which had been cloned in plasmid pCD1-1. Sequence analysis revealed that the order of genes in the cat1 operon-containing gene cluster was ORF porin, catR1, catB1C1A1D, ORF1, and ORF2. Two ORFs located immediately downstream catD were most similar with two ORFs in cat gene cluster of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus ADP1 but the gene structure of catR1B1C1A1 was closest to that found in Frateurua sp. ANA-18 or Pseudomonas putida PRS2000. CatA1 gene product was significantly overexpressed and detected in SDS-PAGE when four cat1 genes (catB1C1A1D) were placed under the control of a lac promoter in pUC118 while overexpressions of other cat genes were accomplished under the control of a lac promoter in pET vector system. All gene products were verified by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Gel retardation assay revealed that the putative regulatory gene activator CatR1 for the catB1C1A1 operon could bind the promoter region of catB2 as well as catB1, suggesting that transcription of catB1 or catB2 might be controlled by the putative gene activator CatR1. However, the promoter regions of catA1 and catA2 were found to have no affinity with catR1.",1.0
11,Biochemical and biophysical research communications ,PUBMED: 11401523; ,"Ca(2+) signaling is important for growth and survival of prostatic carcinoma (PCa) cells. Here we report that the gene for CaT1, a channel protein highly selective for Ca(2+), is expressed at high levels in human PCa and in the LNCaP PCa cell line. CaT1 mRNA levels were elevated in PCa specimens in comparison to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) specimens and positively correlated with Gleason grade in a PCa series. CaT1 mRNA was suppressed by androgen and was induced by a specific androgen receptor antagonist in LNCaP cells, suggesting that the gene is negatively regulated by androgen. These findings are the first to implicate a Ca(2+) channel in PCa progression and suggest that CaT1 may be a novel target for therapy.",1.0
12,Cytokine ,PUBMED: 32980687; ,"Hepatic fibrosis is characterized by abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the primary cells that produce ECM in response to hepatic injury, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) has been regarded as the central stimulus responsible for HSC-mediated ECM production. In the present study, we attempted to identify a critical factor in HSC activation and the underlying mechanism. By analyzing online microarray expression profiles, we found that the expression of high-affinity cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1) was upregulated in hepatic fibrosis models and activated HSCs. We isolated and identified mouse HSCs (MHSCs) and found that in these cells, CAT1 was most highly upregulated by TGF-β1 stimulation in both time- and dose-dependent manners. In vitro, CAT1 overexpression further enhanced, while CAT1 silencing inhibited, the effect of TGF-β1 in promoting MHSC activation. In vivo, CAT1 silencing significantly improved the hepatic fibrosis induced by both CCl4 and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In summary, CAT1 was significantly upregulated in TGF-β1-activated MHSCs and mice with hepatic fibrosis. CAT1 silencing inhibited TGF-β1-induced MHSC activation in vitro and fibrogenic changes in vivo. CAT1 is a promising target for hepatic fibrosis treatment that requites further investigation in human cells and clinical practice.",1.0
13,Biochemical and biophysical research communications ,PUBMED: 9473520; ,"Previously, we have reported that two clustered cat genes from Acenitobacter lwoffi K24 had different arrangements, catB1C1A1 and catB2A2C2 (Kim, S.I., S.-H.

By further analysis of the organization of the cat1 gene cluster, we obtained a complete sequence of the catB1 gene, which encoded 40.8-kDa polypeptide containing 379 amino acids, and found a open reading frame (ORF) coding a putative regulatory protein in upstream region of catB1 on plasmid pCD1-1. This ORF encoded 34.2-kDa polypeptide containing 379 amino acids and had more than 40% identity with catR, LysR family regulatory protein of Pseudomonas putida.

14,International journal of molecular sciences ,PUBMED: 36233327; ,"WRKYs are one of the largest transcription factor (TF) families and play an important role in plant resistance to various stresses. TaWRKY133, a group I WRKY protein, responds to a variety of abiotic stresses, including PEG treatment. The TaWRKY133 protein is located in the nucleus of tobacco epidermal cells, and both its N-terminal and C-terminal domains exhibit transcriptional activation activity. Overexpression of TaWRKY133 reduced drought tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana, as reflected by a lower germination rate, shorter roots, higher stomatal aperture, poorer growth and lower antioxidant enzyme activities under drought treatment. Moreover, expression levels of stress-related genes (DREB2A, RD29A, RD29B, ABF1, ABA2, ABI1, SOD (Cu/Zn), POD1 and CAT1) were downregulated in transgenic Arabidopsis under drought stress. Gene silencing of TaWRKY133 enhanced the drought tolerance of wheat, as reflected in better growth, higher antioxidant enzyme activities, and higher expression levels of stress-related genes including DREB1, DREB3, ABF, ERF3, SOD (Fe), POD, CAT and P5CS. In conclusion, these results suggest that TaWRKY133 might reduce drought tolerance in plants by regulating the expression of stress-related genes.",1.0
15,Food & function ,PUBMED: 30238944; ,"Blueberry is rich in bioactive phytochemicals with a wide of range of biological activities and health benefits. However, little is known about their effects on aging. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of supplementation with a blueberry extract (BE) on lifespan and stress resistance using Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as a model. The mechanisms of these effects were explored using RNAi technology. The mean lifespan of C. elegans treated with BE at 50, 100, and 200 mg mL-1 was significantly increased by 22.2%, 36.5%, and 44.4%, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, supplementation with BE improved motility and decreased lipofuscin accumulation. C. elegans pretreated with BE were more resistant than untreated C. elegans to stresses (heat, ultraviolet-B radiation, and paraquat). Treatment with BE resulted in up-regulation of genes related to antioxidant systems, including sod-3, cat-1, mev-1, skn-1, mek-1, nhr-8, and daf-16. Suppression of daf-16 by RNAi shortened the lifespan of C. elegans and inhibited the expression of sod-3, suggesting that BE may regulate sod-3 downstream of daf-16 to extend lifespan and stress resistance. Our findings revealed that, in C. elegans, BE can prolong the lifespan, improve health indexes, and enhance stress resistance.",1.0
16,Advances in experimental medicine and biology ,PUBMED: 34251635; ,"Amino acids have pleiotropic roles in animal biology including protein and glucose synthesis, cellular metabolism, antioxidant reactions, immune enhancers, and inducers or suppressors of gene expression. Recent studies have revealed important roles of amino acids in the regulation of gene expression in animals. Discoveries of cellular amino acid sensors and their mechanistic pathways have broadened our understanding of how the body responds to the deprivation of nutrients and amino acids in particular. Alterations in concentrations of extracellular amino acids can modulate transcription, translation, posttranscriptional modifications, and epigenetic regulation of genes and proteins. Cells have intracellular amino acid sensors, for example, Sestrin2 for leucine and CASTOR2 for arginine, that respond to sufficiency or deficiency in amino acids, thereby inhibiting or activating downstream signals for gene expression, respectively. The sufficiency of an amino acid in cells ensures its binding to cognate sensors and suppression of inhibitors of MTOR, leading to increased global protein synthesis. On the other hand, deprivation of amino acids activates the amino acid response pathway (GCN2-eIF2a-ATF4), leading to increased selective translation of the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Deficiency of an amino acid itself or via the action of ATF4 suppression of MTORC1 activity limits global protein synthesis. ATF4, in response to low concentrations of cellular amino acids, mediates the transcription of groups of genes such as those for amino acid transport and biosynthesis (ASNS, CAT-1, SNAT2), autophagy (ATG3, ATG10, ATG12), and serine-glycine synthesis (PHGDH, PSAT1, PSPH, MTHFD2). Long-term amino acid starvation has a pronounced effect on cells: suppressed expression and translation of genes required for normal cell growth and metabolism and enhanced expression of genes required for cell adaptation and survival. Levels of amino acids also affect the posttranslational modifications of proteins through mechanisms such as acetylation, ADP-ribosylation, disulfide bond formation, glutamylation, and hydroxylation.",1.0

We describe here the implementation of a CRISPR-based system to regulate expression in the clinically important yeast Candida albicans By fusing an allele of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 devoid of nuclease activity to a transcriptional repressor (Nrg1) or activator (Gal4), we were able to show specific repression or activation of the tester gene CAT1, encoding the cytosolic catalase. We generated strains where a 1.6-kbp upstream regulatory region of CAT1 controls the expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and demonstrated the functionality of the constructs by quantitative PCR (qPCR), flow cytometry, and analysis of sensitivity/resistance to hydrogen peroxide. Activation and repression were strongly dependent on the position of the complex in this regulatory region. We also improved transcriptional activation using an RNA scaffolding strategy to allow interaction of inactive variants of Cas9 (dCas9) with the RNA binding protein MCP (monocyte chemoattractant protein) fused to the VP64 activator. The strategy shown here may facilitate the analysis of complex regulatory traits in this fungal pathogen.IMPORTANCE CRISPR technology is a new and efficient way to edit genomes, but it is also an appealing way to regulate gene expression. We have implemented CRISPR as a gene expression platform in Candida albicans using fusions between a Cas9 inactive enzyme and specific repressors or activators and demonstrated its functionality.

Genetic response of P. harmala was examined by quantitative estimation and electrophoretic separation of catalase and salt-soluble proteins. The gene expression of catalase and osmotin were investigated using RT-PCR. Final percentage of germination at the eighth day of germination was reduced from 85% in the control to 70 and 30% under the concentration of 150 and 200 mM. The catalase activity and protein content increased as the salinity increased compared to control seedlings. The electrophoretic separation of catalase and salt-soluble proteins exhibited stress-related isozymes and protein bands. RT-PCR of cat1, cat2-3 and cat3 and osmotin genes exhibited up-regulation and down-regulation of genes subsequent to salinity. The reduced germination percentage of salt stressed seedlings was attributed to oxidative damage and osmotic imbalance. The increased catalase activity and protein content were concluded as protective response of P. harmala seedlings to salinity induced oxidative stress and osmoregulation. The additional isozyme bands in the salt-stressed seedlings indicated modulation of CAT gene expression in response to elevated H2O2 subsequent to salinity. The stress specific gene expression was interpreted as molecular mechanism by which plants can tolerate salinity stress. The up-regulation of cat2-3 gene in relation to stress suggests it crucial role in salinity tolerance in P. harmala and further studies are needed for its sequence identification.",1.0
19,The Journal of biological chemistry ,PUBMED: 12361955; ,"T-lymphocyte activation requires sustained Ca(2+) signaling dependent upon capacitative Ca(2+) entry (CCE). The protein(s) that forms the stores-operated Ca(2+) channel (SOCC) responsible for CCE has long been sought but has not been definitively identified. Members of the TRPV family (transient receptor potential superfamily-vanilloid receptor subfamily) of channel genes have been proposed to encode SOCCs responsible for CCE in non-excitable cells. Here we present evidence that a member of the TRPV group, CaT1, is involved in generating I(CRAC), the CCE current that is necessary for T-cell activation. CaT1 is expressed in Jurkat T-lymphocytes. When overexpressed in Jurkat cells, CaT1 produces a Ca(2+) entry current that mimics the endogenous I(CRAC) in its dependence on external Ca(2+), inactivation by elevated concentration of internal Ca(2+), and pharmacological block by capsaicin. Overexpressed CaT1 is partially regulated by the release of internal Ca(2+) stores via thapsigargin or receptor-mediated generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. A pore-region mutant of CaT1, TRIA-CaT1, fails to carry Ca(2+) currents and associates with co-expressed wild type CaT1 to functionally suppress permeation of Ca(2+) ions. Expression of the TRIA-CaT1 mutant in Jurkat cells results in suppression of the endogenous I(CRAC). Taken together these results indicate that CaT1 is the channel protein that contributes to T-lymphocyte SOCCs either alone or as a subunit in a heterogeneous channel complex.",1.0

These strains were isolated from the patients before (initial) and after treatment (final), and 45 days after the treatments (follow-up). For gene expression analyses, RNA was isolated from the clinical strains, followed by cDNA synthesis and qPCR using specific primers for each target gene. The samples that present integrity were pooled to increase the RNA yield. In the end, four patients treated with aPDT and five patients treated with NYS had the clinical isolates of C. albicans submitted to gene expression evaluation. The data demonstrated a statistical difference in the expression of PLB1 and ACT1 for the different therapies (aPDT versus NYS). Also, there was a statistical difference in the expression of CAT1, SOD1, and LIP3 at the time intervals assessed (initial, final, and follow-up).

The inherent resistance of Candida strains producing biofilms to antimicrobial agents is an important and key feature for biofilm growth, which can lead to treatment failure. This resistance is due to the regulatory increase of the output pumps, the presence of extracellular matrix, and the existence of persister cells. Persister cells are phenotypic variants that have MICs similar to antibiotic-sensitive populations and are able to tolerate high doses of antibiotics. The current study investigated the possible role of EFG1, BCR1, and CAT1 in the establishment or maintenance of persister cells in Candida albicans strains that produce biofilms.",1.0

Haplotypes of one of the major antioxidant enzyme, catalase (CAT), are associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. The haplotype referred to as CAT1 includes homozygous carriers of CATH1 [-844G,-89A,-20T], whereas CAT2 haplotype includes heterozygous carriers (CATH1/CATH2) and CATH2 homozygous [-844A,-89T,-20C]. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of CAT1 and CAT2 haplotypes on traditional cardiovascular and metabolic markers one year after BS in a women population. The 294 women with a body mass index (BMI) >35 kg/m2 were followed-up for one year after BS, monitoring their anthropometric, metabolic and inflammatory parameters. CAT1 patients had significantly improved diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and Creactive protein (CRP) levels compared to CAT2 one year after BS. In untreated women at baseline, the change of CRP one year after BS was higher in CAT1 patients. In the population of women receiving at least one anti-lipidic, anti-hypertensive or anti-diabetic treatment at baseline, DBP and fat mass were lower one year after BS in CAT1 patients and the greater change of fat mass was associated with a higher change of adiponectin. The results highlight the beneficial impact of the CAT1 haplotype on traditional cardiovascular and metabolic parameters after BS. Our findings suggest that the CAT1 haplotype could be implicated in the level of metabolic and cardiovascular improvement after BS.",1.0

Clostridium tyrobutyricum Δack::cat1, with deleted ack gene and overexpressed cat1 gene, was used as the butyric-acid-fermentation strain. MOFs was employed as a photocatalyst to improve butyric acid production, as well as a cytoprotective exoskeleton with immobilized cellulase for the hydrolysis of rice straw. Thus, the survival of MOFs-coated strain, the thermostability and pH stability of cellulase both remarkably increased. As a result, 55% of rice straw was hydrolyzed in 24 h, and the final concentration of butyric acid in visible light was increased by 14.23% and 29.16% compared to uncoated and coated strain without visible light, respectively.

K. melanthera is a typical psammophyte species which has high drought resistance. The reference genes of K. melanthera are not yet reported. This study aims to evaluate the expression stability of 14 candidate reference genes (EF1A, GAPDH, ACT1, UBI, TUBB3, TIPRL, CACS, PPP2R1B, TUBA1A, EIF4A1, CYPA3, TCTP, ABCG11L, and FBXO6L) under five treatments (drought, heat, cold, salt, and ABA) and find the most stable and suitable one even upon stressed conditions. The software NormFinder, GeNorm, BestKeeper, and RefFinder were used for data analysis. In general, the genes CACS and PPP2R1B are concluded to have the best overall performance under the various treatments. With the ABA treatment, TCTP and TIPRL show the best stability. CACS and TCTP, as well as TIPRL and CYPA3, were most stable under the treatments of cold and salt, respectively. CACS and FBXO6L were ranked the highest with the heat treatment and drought treatment, respectively. Finally, the Catalase-1 (CAT1) gene was used to verify the reliability of the above reference genes. Accordingly, CAT1's expression pattern remained unchanged after normalization with stable reference genes.

However, available data only concern the presence in these cells of CAT1 transporter (system y(+)), while no information exists on the role of the heterodimeric transporters of system y(+)L (4F2hc/y(+)LAT1 and 4F2hc/y(+)LAT2) which operates transmembrane arginine fluxes cis-inhibited by neutral amino acids in the presence of sodium. Using erythroleukemia K562 cells and normal erythroid precursors, we demonstrate here that arginine transport in human erythroid cells is due to the additive contributions of a leucine-sensitive and leucine-insensitive component. In both cell types, leucine inhibition of arginine influx is much less evident in the absence of sodium, a hallmark of system y(+)L. In K562 cells, N-ethylmaleimide, a known inhibitor of CAT transporters (system y(+)), suppresses only a fraction of arginine influx corresponding to leucine-insensitive uptake. Moreover, in Xenopus oocytes coexpressing 4F2hc and y(+)LAT2, leucine exerts a marked inhibition of arginine transport, partially dependent on sodium, while no inhibition is seen in oocytes expressing CAT1. Lastly, silencing of SLC7A6, the gene for y(+)LAT2, lowers arginine transport and doubles the intracellular content of the cationic amino acid in K562 cells. We conclude that arginine transport in human erythroid cells is due to both system y(+) (CAT1 transporter) and system y(+)L (4F2hc/y(+)LAT2 isoform), which mainly contribute, respectively, to the influx and to the efflux of the cationic amino acid.",1.0

Here we report the dependence of CAT1 expression and H(2)O(2) production on a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. CAT1 transcript was induced in an ABA-dependent way and the induction was abolished in the T-DNA insertion mutant mkk1 (SALK_015914), while AtMKK1 overexpression significantly enhanced the ABA-induced CAT1 expression and H(2)O(2) production. AtMPK6, another component in the MAPK cascade, was also involved: mpk6 mutant blocked and overexpressing AtMPK6 enhanced the ABA-dependent expression of CAT1 and H(2)O(2) production. The activity of AtMPK6 was increased by ABA in an AtMKK1-dependent manner. These data clearly suggest an ABA-dependent signaling pathway connecting CAT1 expression through a phosphorelay including AtMKK1 and AtMPK6. In further support of this view, mkk1 mutant reduced both the sensitivity to ABA during germination and the drought tolerance of seedlings, whereas the AtMKK1 overexpression line showed the opposite responses when compared with the wild type. The data suggest AtMKK1-AtMPK6 to be a key module in an ABA-dependent signaling cascade causing H(2)O(2) production and stress responses.",1.0

In this study, we analyzed the expression level of microRNA-122 (miRNA-122) and its target mRNA, CAT1, in intact young male minipigs fed either high-cholesterol or standard diet for 11 wk. MiRNA-122 and CAT1 are known to be important regulators of lipid metabolism. The weight of the young minipigs was monitored once a week during the feeding period; measurements of total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins, and low-density lipoproteins were recorded at 4 time points (8, 14, 16, and 19 wk of age) in fasting animals during the feeding scheme. Body weight, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoproteins were higher in pigs fed the high-cholesterol compared with the standard diet. In contrast, the level of triglycerides was lower in pigs on the high-cholesterol diet than those receiving the standard diet. Pigs fed high-cholesterol also had lower miRNA-122 levels than did those fed the standard diet. These results suggest that in our minipigs, the increase in weight and cholesterol levels resulting from subchronic (11 wk) feeding of a high-cholesterol diet is correlated with a decrease in the expression of miRNA-122, confirming the implication of this microRNA in obesity.

Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) stably overexpressing CAT1 (HEK-CAT1) and vector-transfected control cells (HEK-VC) were established to determine cellular uptake of labeled [(3)H]ADMA and [(3)H]l-arginine. Uptake of ADMA and l-arginine were significantly (p<0.001) higher in HEK-CAT1 than in HEK-VC at all investigated concentrations. Apparent V(max) values of cellular ADMA and l-arginine uptake by CAT1 were 26.9 ± 0.8 and 11.0 ± 0.2 nmol mg protein(-1) min(-1), respectively. K(m) values were 183 ± 21 μmoll(-1) (ADMA) and 519 ± 36 μmoll(-1) (l-arginine).

This work aimed to evaluate the function of miR-294, miR-301b, and miR-410 during early C57BL/6 bone marrow-derived macrophage infection with L. amazonensis. We observed an upregulation of miR-294 and miR-410 at 4 h of infection, but the levels of miR-301b were not modified. This profile was not observed in LPS-stimulated macrophages. We also observed decreased levels of those miRNAs target genes during infection, such as Cationic amino acid transporters 1 (Cat1/Slc7a1), Cat2/Slc7a22 and Nos2; genes were upregulated in LPS stimuli. The functional inhibition of miR-294 led to the upregulation of Cat2 and Tnfa and the dysregulation of Nos2, while miR-410 increased Cat1 levels. miR-294 inhibition reduced the number of amastigotes per infected macrophage, showing a reduction in the parasite growth inside the macrophage. These data identified miR-294 and miR-410 biomarkers for a potential regulator in the inflammatory profiles of microphages mediated by L. amazonensis infection.

In winter rye leaves (Secale cereale L.) posttranscriptional mechanisms determine the rate of new catalase synthesis, including a light-controlled reversible modification of the catalase cat1 mRNA by methylation which greatly enhanced its translation efficiency. The specificity and regulation of this mRNA activation were further investigated. The translation efficiency of the rye cat1 mRNA was much more enhanced by N-7 methylation of the cap than that of an lhcb transcript. Investigations with truncated rye cat1 mRNAs indicated that the translational enhancement resulting from N-7 cap methylation did not require the presence of specific sequences of cat1 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions. Translational activation of the cat1 mRNA in rye leaves was independent of photosynthesis and most effectively induced by blue light. Peroxides (H(2)O(2), tertiary butyl hydroperoxide) and conditions enforcing an H(2)O(2) accumulation in the leaves (aminotriazole, paraquat) also caused an activation of the cat1 mRNA. A search for further signalling systems controlling the replenishment of inactivated catalase in light suggested that an inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate-mediated liberation of Ca(2+) from internal stores and a protein phosphatase played some role. However, these signalling systems did not affect the activation of the cat1 mRNA. After removal of Ca(2+) by EGTA the cat1 mRNA was rapidly degraded.",1.0

System y+ cationic amino acid transport is mediated by proteins encoded by a family of genes, Cat1, Cat2, and Cat3. High affinity L-arginine transport was investigated in embryonic fibroblast cells derived from Cat1 knockout mice that lack functional Cat1. Both wild type and knockout cells transport arginine with comparable Km and Vmax. However, the apparent affinity for lysine transport was 2.4 times lower in Cat1(-/-) cells when compared with wild type cells, a property characteristic of Cat3-mediated transport. Northern analysis-documented Cat2 mRNA increased 2-fold, whereas Cat3 mRNA levels increased 11-fold in Cat1(-/-) relative to Cat1(+/+) cells. The low affinity Cat2a mRNA was not detectably expressed in these cells. Even though Cat3 expression is normally limited to adult brain, there was a large increase in the amount of Cat3 protein present at the plasma membrane of Cat1(-/-) embryonic fibroblast cells.

In young leaves, only Cat1 and Cat3 transcripts increase in response to wounding, but JA does not play a role. Cat1 and Cat3 transcript accumulation also increases in response to wounding in both wild-type and mutant leaves deficient in abscisic acid (ABA), implying that Cat1 and Cat3 induction in response to wounding is not mediated by ABA in leaves. Transient assays using the Cat1 promoter fused with the reporter gene Gus, showed that the DNA sequence motif responsible for Cat1 upregulation by wounding overlaps with the ABA-responsive element (ABRE, G-box) in the Cat1 promoter. The exact nature of the signals triggering the Cat responses to wounding is not clear at this point, but some evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a role in this response. In fact, we have found that endogenous H(2)O(2) levels increase in wounded leaves. Thus, wounding may indirectly induce the production of H(2)O(2) in leaves, triggering the antioxidant response.",1.0

Several studies define mechanisms for gastrointestinal peptide hormone stimulation of glucose uptake. An oligopeptide transporter, PepT1, is transcriptionally upregulated by certain dietary amino acids and dipeptides.

The different sugars produce signals which modify the conformation of certain proteins that, in turn, directly or through a regulatory cascade affect the expression of the genes subject to catabolite repression. These genes are not all controlled by a single set of regulatory proteins, but there are different circuits of repression for different groups of genes. However, the protein kinase Snf1/Cat1 is shared by the various circuits and is therefore a central element in the regulatory process. Snf1 is not operative in the presence of glucose, and preliminary evidence suggests that Snf1 is in a dephosphorylated state under these conditions. However, the enzymes that phosphorylate and dephosphorylate Snf1 have not been identified, and it is not known how the presence of glucose may affect their activity. What has been established is that Snf1 remains active in mutants lacking either the proteins Grr1/Cat80 or Hxk2 or the Glc7 complex, which functions as a protein phosphatase. One of the main roles of Snf1 is to relieve repression by the Mig1 complex, but it is also required for the operation of transcription factors such as Adr1 and possibly other factors that are still unidentified. Although our knowledge of catabolite repression is still very incomplete, it is possible in certain cases to propose a partial model of the way in which the different elements involved in catabolite repression may be integrated.",1.0

To investigate the pleiotrophic nature of the disruptant, we examined the effect of the catalase inhibitor 3-AT on the growth of wild-type strains. Surprisingly, the addition of 3-AT and SDS caused the wild-type cells to be non-viable on YPD plates. We found an additional phenotype of the catalase gene disruptant: it did not produce normal hyphae on Spider medium. Hyphal growth was observed in a CAP1 (Candida AP-1-like protein gene) disruptant, a HOG1 (high-osmolarity glycerol signaling pathway gene) disruptant, and the double CAP1/HOG1 disruptant, suggesting that the defect in hyphal formation by the catalase disruptant was independent of these genes. Addition of 3-AT and SDS to hyphae-inducing media suppressed growth of normal hyphae in the wild-type strain. The potential necessity for catalase action upon exposure to hyphae-inducing conditions was confirmed by the immediate elevation of the catalase gene message. In spite of the requirement for catalase during hyphal growth, the catalase gene disruptant was capable of forming germ tubes in medium containing serum.",1.0

By screening for mutants that failed to derepress a UAS2PCK1-CYC1-lacZ reporter gene we isolated the new recessive derepression mutation cat5. The CAT5 gene encodes a protein of 272 amino acids showing a 42% identity to the ZC395.2 gene product of Caenorhabditis elegans whose function is unknown. Deletion of CAT5 caused a complete loss of glucose derepression affecting gluconeogenic key enzymes. Respiration, but not mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity, was also affected. CAT5 expression is 5- to 6-fold repressed by glucose, and CAT5 transcriptional activation was dependent on CAT1 (SNF1), CAT8 and CAT5 itself. The CAT5 gene is necessary for UAS1PCK1 and UAS2PCK1 protein binding since a carbon source-specific interaction was no longer detectable in cat5 mutants. Glucose derepression of gluconeogenesis depends on the active Cat1 (Snf1) protein kinase and the Cat8 zinc cluster activator. Mig1p-independent overexpression of CAT8 did not stimulate activation of gluconeogenic promoters in cat1 and in cat5 mutants. Since Cat8p multicopy expression suppresses the ethanol growth deficiency in cat1 (snf1) mutants, these results indicate that activation of Cat8p by the Cat1p (Snf1p) kinase and the Cat5p protein might be necessary for release from glucose repression.",1.0

MicroRNAs have been shown to be involved in the development of many cancers, but little is known about their role in the process of colorectal liver metastasis. We compared miRNA expression between primary colorectal tumors and liver metastasis to identify those involved in the process of metastasis. Cancer cells were isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary CRC samples and their corresponding metastatic liver tumors in six patients using laser capture microdissection, and miRNA expression was analyzed using TaqMan miRNA arrays. The most abundant miRNA in liver metastasis compared with primary tumors was miR-122. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the expression levels of cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1), a negative target gene of miR-122, were lower in liver metastases than primary tumors (P < 0.001). Expression levels of CAT1 in 132 primary tumors were negatively correlated with the existence of synchronous liver metastasis (P = 0.0333) and tumor stage (P < 0.0001). In an analysis of 121 colon cancer patients without synchronous liver metastasis, patients with CAT1-low colon cancer had significantly shorter liver metastasis-free survival (P = 0.0258) but not overall survival or disease-free survival. Overexpression of miR-122 and concomitant suppression of CAT1 in the primary tumor appears to play important roles in the development of colorectal liver metastasis. Expression of CAT1 in the primary CRC has the potential to be a novel biomarker to predict the risk of postoperative liver metastasis of CRC patients.",1.0
47,Genetics ,PUBMED: 9584109; ,"Angiosperms (flowering plants), including both monocots and dicots, contain small catalase gene families. In the dicot, Arabidopsis thaliana, two catalase (CAT) genes, CAT1 and CAT3, are tightly linked on chromosome 1 and a third, CAT2, which is more similar to CAT1 than to CAT3, is unlinked on chromosome 4. Comparison of positions and numbers of introns among 13 angiosperm catalase genomic sequences indicates that intron positions are conserved, and suggests that an ancestral catalase gene common to monocots and dicots contained seven introns. Arabidopsis CAT2 has seven introns; both CAT1 and CAT3 have six introns in positions conserved with CAT2, but each has lost a different intron. We suggest the following sequence of events during the evolution of the Arabidopsis catalase gene family. An initial duplication of an ancestral catalase gene gave rise to CAT3 and CAT1. CAT1 then served as the template for a second duplication, yielding CAT2. Intron losses from CAT1 and CAT3 followed these duplications. One subclade of monocot catalases has lost all but the 5'-most and 3'-most introns, which is consistent with a mechanism of intron loss by replacement of an ancestral intron-containing gene with a reverse-transcribed DNA copy of a fully spliced mRNA. Following this event of concerted intron loss, the Oryza sativa (rice, a monocot) CAT1 lineage acquired an intron in a novel position, consistent with a mechanism of intron gain at proto-splice sites.",1.0

Transporters examined included the peptide transporter PepT1, the glutamate/aspartate (EAAT3), cationic (CAT-1) and neutral (B0AT) amino acid transporters, and the fructose (GLUT5) and glucose (SGLT1) transporters. Digestive enzymes included aminopeptidase N (APN) and sucrase-isomaltase (SI).

The PepT1 and APN gene expression in the YSM increased until E15 and then decreased until E21, whereas expression in the intestine increased from E15 to E21. The B0AT showed a similar pattern, with greatest expression in the YSM occurring at E17/E19. The CAT1 and GLUT5 genes showed decreased expression in the YSM and increased expression in the intestine until E17/E19 and then a decrease until E21. Expression of SGLT1 and EAAT3 showed increased gene expression over time in both the intestine and YSM. Expression of SI showed little to no gene expression in the YSM, whereas the intestine exhibited consistently high levels of gene expression. In YSM and intestine, SI expression was greater in Leghorn than Cobb, whereas CAT1 and GLUT5 expression was greater in Cobb than Leghorn. Expression of the APN, CAT1, and SI genes was greater in embryos from young flocks than old flocks in YSM and intestine. These results demonstrate that the YSM expresses many of the digestive enzymes and nutrient transporters typically associated with the intestine and that these genes show tissue- and development-specific patterns of expression.",1.0

Among the Candida species, Candida albicans is the most prevalent. The expression of virulence genes is implicated in the pathogenic potential of Candida biofilms. However, the evaluation of microbial gene expression from in vivo biofilm samples is not trivial, specifically, assessment via quantitative PCR (qPCR) can be a challenge because of several species present in clinical samples. Hence, the necessity of primers specificity. The aim of this study was to evaluate through in silico and in vitro analyses the specificity of published primers and newly designed primers for C. albicans virulence genes: ALS1, CAP1, CAT1, EFG1, HWP1, LIP3, PLB1, SAP1, SAP4, SOD1, SOD5 and ACT1 (normalizing gene). In silico analysis was performed through a PubMed search of articles with primer sequences that evaluated gene expression of C. albicans. Then, the sequence similarity of twenty-eight primers was checked through BLASTn and ClustalW2. The analysis of secondary structures was performed using mfold. When the primers did not present satisfactory characteristics (absence of secondary structures, not discrepant Tm of forward and reverse sequences and specificity) following in vitro analysis (i.e., end point PCR), new primers were designed using Beacon Designer™ and sequences obtained from the ""Candida Genome Database"". The selected primers were tested in vitro by end point PCR using a panel of genomic DNA from five different Candida species (C. albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida dubliniensis, Candida krusei, and Candida tropicalis). The resulting PCR products were visualized on agarose gel. qPCR reactions were performed to determine primers' optimal concentration and PCR efficiency. End point PCR demonstrated that published primers for the SAP1 and HWP1 were specific for C. albicans and the one for SOD1 reacted with C. albicans and C. dubliniensis. The sequence of primers designed for ACT1, ALS1 and HWP1 genes were specific for C. albicans, while the ones for CAP1, CAT1, EFG1, LIP3, and PLB1 were detected in C. albicans and C. dubliniensis. After optimization, all primers presented a single peak on melt curves, correlation coefficient of ≅1 and qPCR reaction efficiency of 90-110%, with slope of ≅-3.3.

MbCBF1 protein was found to be localized in the nucleus after subcellular localization. Furthermore, the expression of MbCBF1 was highly accumulated in new leaves and roots due to the high influence of cold and high salt in M. baccata seedlings. After introducing MbCBF1 into A. thaliana, transgenic A. thaliana can better adapt to the living conditions of cold and high salt. The increased expression of MbCBF1 in A. thaliana also increased the contents of proline, remarkablely improved the activities of SOD, POD and CAT, but the content of MDA was decreased. Although the chlorophyll content also decreased, it decreased less in transgenic plants. In short, above date showed that MbCBF1 has a positive effect on improving A. thaliana cold and high salt tolerance. MbCBF1 can regulate the expression of its downstream gene in transgenic lines, up-regulate the expression of key genes COR15a, RD29a/bandCOR6.6/47 related to low temperature under cold conditions and NCED3, CAT1, P5CS1, RD22, DREB2A,PIF1/4, SOS1 and SnRK2.4 related to salt stress under high salt conditions, so as to further improve the adaptability and tolerance of the transgenic plants to low temperature and high salt environment.",1.0

Short UV light pulses also cause a strong transient induction of Cat2 gene expression, while long term exposure to UV does not affect the rate of Cat2 transcription. The Cat3 gene of maize exhibits a transcriptionally regulated circadian rhythm. The induction of the Cat3 circadian expression in etiolated leaves is probably regulated by a very low fluence phytochrome response; the involvement of a blue light/UV-A and a UV-B photoreceptor is also possible.

Disruption of tsc2+, one of the tsc+ genes, has been shown to result in decreased arginine uptake and resistance to canavanine. A similar effect is also seen with other basic amino acids. We have identified a permease responsible for the uptake of basic amino acids by genetic complementation and disruption. SPAC869.11 (termed Cat1 for cationic amino acid transporter) contains 12 predicted transmembrane domains and its overexpression in wild type fission yeast leads to the increased uptake of basic amino acids and sensitivity to canavanine. Disruption of cat1+ in the deltatsc2 background interfered with the suppression of the canavanine-resistant phenotype of Atsc2 mutants by a dominant negative Rheb. In deltatsc2 mutant strains, the amount of Cat1 was not altered, but instead was mislocalized. This mislocalization was suppressed by the expression of dominant negative Rheb. In addition, we found that the loss of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Pub1, also restores proper localization.

Twenty embryos/birds from each group were sacrificed by cervical dislocation on embryonic day (E) 9, 11, 13, 15 and day of hatch (DOH). The eggs, embryos (without yolk sac), and organs (head, brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidney, gizzard, small intestine, legs, and thorax) were dissected, cleaned, and weighed. Small intestine samples were collected for RNA isolation. The mRNA abundance of intestinal nutrient transporters was evaluated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We classified these ten organs into four types according to the changes in relative weight during embryonic development. In addition, the gene expression of nutrient transporters was differentially regulated by embryonic day. The mRNA abundances of b(0,+)AT, EAAT3, y(+)LAT2, PepT1, LAT4, NHE2, and NHE3 increased linearly with age, whereas mRNA abundances of CAT1, CAT2, LAT1, EAAT2, SNAT1, and SNAT2 were increased to higher levels on E9 or E11 and then decreased to lower levels until DOH.

All SlBAG proteins harbor a characteristic BAG domain, categorized into two groups, and SlBAG4, SlBAG7, and SlBAG9 of group I contain a plant-specific isoleucine glutamine (IQ) calmodulin-binding motif located in the N terminus. The quantitative real-time PCR expression analysis revealed that these SlBAG genes had organ-specific expression patterns and most SlBAG genes were differentially expressed in multiple abiotic stresses including drought, salt, high temperature, cold, and cadmium stress as well as abscisic acid and H2O2. In addition, heterologous overexpression of SlBAG9 increased the sensitivity of Arabidopsis to drought, salt, and ABA during seed germination and seedling growth. The decreased tolerance may be due to the downregulation of stress-related genes expression and severe oxidative stress. The expression levels of some stress and ABA-related genes, such as ABI3, RD29A, DREB2A, and P5CS1, were significantly inhibited by SlBAG9 overexpression under osmotic stress.

We manipulated the night environment and examined cellular and molecular changes in hippocampus, the brain region involved in cognition and mood, of Indian house crows (Corvus splendens) exposed to 12 hr light (150 lux): 12 hr darkness (0 lux). Diurnal corvids are an ideal model species with cognitive abilities at par with mammals. Dim light (6 lux) at night (dLAN) altered daily activity:rest pattern, reduced sleep, and induced depressive-like responses (decreased eating and self-grooming, self-mutilation, and reduced novel object exploration); return to an absolute dark night reversed these negative effects. dLAN suppressed nocturnal melatonin levels; however, diurnal corticosterone levels were unaffected. Concomitant reduction of immunoreactivity for DCX and BDNF suggested dLAN-induced suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis and compromised neuronal health. dLAN also negatively influenced hippocampal expression of genes associated with depressive-like responses (bdnf, il-1β, tnfr1, nr4a2), but not of those associated with neuronal plasticity (egr1, creb, syngap, syn2, grin2a, grin2b), cellular oxidative stress (gst, sod3, cat1) and neuronal death (caspase2, caspase3, foxo3). Furthermore, we envisaged the role of BDNF and showed epigenetic modification of bdnf gene by decreased histone H3 acetylation and increased hdac4 expression under dLAN. These results demonstrate transcriptional and epigenetic bases of dLAN-induced negative effects in diurnal crows, and provide insights into the risks of exposure to illuminated nights to animals including humans in an urban setting.",1.0

To that effect, Geumgangmil, PL 337 (1AL.1RS), PL 371 (1BL.1RS), and PL 257 (1DL.1RS) seedlings were subjected to four treatments: G1 (control), G2 (stressed thrice with rewatering), G3 (stressed twice with rewatering), and G4 (single stressful event). The findings provided a comprehensive framework of drought-hardening effect at physiological, biochemical, and gene expression levels of drought-stressed wheat genotypes. The treatments resulted in differentially higher levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), soluble sugar, and proline accumulation, and reduced relative water content (RWC) in wheat plants. Photosynthetic pigment (chlorophyll and carotenoid) levels, the membrane stability index (MSI), and shoot biomass decreased dramatically and differently across genotypes, particularly in G3 and G4 compared to G2. The activity of antioxidant enzymes [ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT)] increased with the duration and severity of drought treatment. Furthermore, the relative expression of DREB, LEA, HSP, P5CS, SOD1, CAT1, APX1, RBCL, and CCD1 genes was higher in G2 than in other treatments. Drought hardening increased drought tolerance and adaptability in plants under G2 by enhancing growth and activating defensive mechanisms at the physio-biochemical and molecular levels.

The findings of this study will be useful in initiating a breeding program to develop wheat cultivars with improved drought tolerance.",1.0

In northern blotting using the cDNA-specific probe, the cat1 mRNA levels were high in seeds and early seedlings of pumpkin. The expression pattern of cat1 was similar to that of malate synthase, a characteristic enzyme of glyoxysomes. These data suggest that cat1 might encode a catalase associated with glyoxysomal functions. Furthermore, immunocytochemical analysis using cat1-specific anti-peptide antibody directly showed that cat1 encoding catalase is located in glyoxysomes. The cat2 mRNA was present at high levels in green cotyledons, mature leaf, stem and green hypocotyl of light-grown pumpkin plant, and correlated with chlorophyll content in the tissues. The tissue-specific expression of cat2 had a strong resemblance to that of glycolate oxidase, a characteristic enzyme of leaf peroxisomes. During germination of pumpkin seeds, cat2 mRNA levels increased in response to light, although the increase in cat2 mRNA by light was less than that of glycolate oxidase. cat3 mRNA was abundant in green cotyledons, etiolated cotyledons, green hypocotyl and root, but not in young leaf. cat3 mRNA expression was not dependent on light, but was constitutive in mature tissues. Interestingly, cat1 mRNA levels increased during senescence of pumpkin cotyledons, whereas cat2 and cat3 mRNAs disappeared during senescence, suggesting that cat1 encoding catalase may be involved in the senescence process. Thus, in pumpkin, three catalase genes are differentially regulated and may exhibit different functions.",1.0

However, organosilicon toxicity in aquatic animals is seldom known. In this research, two typical silicone or silane coupling agents (KH-560 (3-Glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane) and KH-570 (3-Methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane)) were used in a hydroponic experiment to evaluate the effects on survival rate, antioxidant response and gene expression in red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii).

The results showed that silicone significantly increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content in muscle by 17%-38% except for the treatment of 100 mg L-1 KH-570, and reduced the survival rate of crayfish. Additionally, silicone KH-570 increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) by 15%-31%, 17%-35%, and 9%-46%, as well as the contents of ascorbate (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) by 19%-31%, and 23%-29% respectively, in muscle tissue, and similar results occurred in KH-560.

Chronic elevated temperatures reduce scutellar catalase activity most noticeably in the inbred lines W64A and R6-67, which express all three CAT isozymes (CAT-1, CAT-2, and CAT-3). The observed decline in catalase activity is primarily attributed to a decrease in the amount of CAT-2 isozyme, due to diminished levels of the Cat2 transcript. As CAT-2 activity levels are regulated by the trans-acting gene locus Car1, it is possible that the Car1 gene product is inhibited at the elevated temperatures. In maize lines null for CAT-2 or both CAT-2 and CAT-3, the relative levels of Cat1 transcript, although steady throughout the 10 days post-imbibition scutellar profile, are slightly higher with increasing temperatures. This might indicate that, in thermally stressed seedlings, the accumulation and/or stability of Cat1 mRNA might compensate for the lack of Cat2 transcript in a tissue where Cat2 mRNA normally accumulates during the developmental period examined. These observations, along with the drastic reduction in seed germination and seedling height at chronically elevated growth temperatures, suggest that developmental arrest, rather than oxidative stress, might be the cause for the observed results relative to Cat gene expression under such conditions.",1.0

We cloned two potato cDNAs corresponding to CAT1 and CAT2 genes, analysed their phylogenetic relationship, and studied their expression and activity in different organs to gain clues to their functions. Phylogenetic trees and the alignment of CAT cDNA sequences provided evidence that CAT1 and CAT2 genes have high identity to catalases of other solanaceous species, but are not phylogenetically closely related to one another, which contradicts the phylogenetic closeness ascribed to these genes. Northern blot analyses revealed that expression of CAT genes is controlled by leaf developmental phase. CAT2 expression was higher in both very young and senescent leaves, whereas CAT1 mRNA accumulated mainly in mature leaf, where the lowest CAT2 expression occurred. CAT1 and CAT2 are also differentially expressed in root, sprout and petal. Expression and activity patterns are consistent with different physiological roles for CAT1 and CAT2 isoforms. CAT1 is considered to be associated with photorespiration whereas CAT2 would fulfill physiological roles unrelated to this process.

This was based on the finding that the ATCC 46645 mutant with mutations in the pksP gene of the DHN-melanin synthesis pathway showed increased sensitivity to reactive oxygen species compared to the wild type. Here, it is shown that deletion of the pksP gene in A. fumigatus strain CEA10 did not affect sensitivity for H2O2 and superoxide in a plate stress assay. In addition, direct exposure of the dormant white conidia of the pksP deletion strains to H2O2 did not result in increased sensitivity. Moreover, complementation of the ATCC 46645 pksP mutant strain with the wild-type pksP gene did result in pigmented conidia but did not rescue the H2O2-sensitive phenotype observed in the plate stress assay. Genome sequencing of the ATCC 46645 pksP mutant strain and its complemented strain revealed a mutation in the cat1 gene, likely due to the UV mutagenesis procedure used previously, which could explain the increased sensitivity toward H2O2. In summary, DHN-melanin is not involved in protection against H2O2 or superoxide and, thus, has no role in survival of conidia when attacked by these reactive oxygen species. IMPORTANCE Opportunistic pathogens like Aspergillus fumigatus have strategies to protect themselves against reactive oxygen species like hydrogen peroxides and superoxides that are produced by immune cells. DHN-melanin is the green pigment on conidia of Aspergillus fumigatus and more than 2 decades ago was reported to protect conidia against hydrogen peroxide. Here, we correct this misinterpretation by showing that DHN-melanin actually is not involved in protection of conidia against hydrogen peroxide. We show that UV mutagenesis that was previously used to select a pksP mutant generated many more genome-wide mutations. We discovered that a mutation in the mycelial catalase gene cat1 could explain the observed phenotype of increased hydrogen peroxide sensitivity. Our work shows that UV mutagenesis is not the preferred methodology to be used for generating mutants. It requires genome sequencing with single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis as well as additional validations to discard unwanted and confirm correct phenotypes.",1.0

Analysis of the FBP1 promoter revealed two upstream activating elements, UAS1FBP1 and UAS2FBP1, which confer carbon source-dependent regulation on a heterologous reporter gene. On glucose media neither element was activated, whereas after transfer to ethanol a 100-fold derepression was observed. This gene activation depended on the previously identified derepression genes CAT1 (SNF1) (encoding a protein kinase) and CAT3 (SNF4) (probably encoding a subunit of Cat1p [Snf1p]). Screening for mutations specifically involved in UAS1FBP1 derepression revealed the new recessive derepression mutation cat8. The cat8 mutants also failed to derepress UAS2FBP1, and these mutants were unable to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources. The CAT8 gene encodes a zinc cluster protein related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gal4p. Deletion of CAT8 caused a defect in glucose derepression which affected all key gluconeogenic enzymes. Derepression of glucose-repressible invertase and maltase was still normally regulated. A CAT8-lacZ promoter fusion revealed that the CAT8 gene itself is repressed by Cat4p (Mig1p). These results suggest that gluconeogenic genes are derepressed upon binding of Cat8p, whose synthesis depends on the release of Cat4p (Mig1p) from the CAT8 promoter. However, gluconeogenic promoters are still glucose repressed in cat4 mutants, which indicates that in addition to its transcription, the Cat8p protein needs further activation. The observation that multicopy expression of CAT8 reverses the inability of cat1 and cat3 mutants to grow on ethanol indicates that Cat8p might be the substrate of the Cat1p/Cat3p protein kinase.",1.0

Two (LBM1210 and LET4910) of the four R. leguminosarum strains significantly improved the growth parameters (fresh and dry aerial weight, FW and DW, respectively), chlorophyll content, and relative water content (RWC) compared to a non-inoculated control under water stress, providing values similar to or even higher for FW (+4%) and RWC (+2.3%) than the non-inoculated and non-stressed control. Some other biochemical parameters and gene expression explain the observed drought stress alleviation, namely the reduction of MDA, H2O2 (stronger when inoculating with LET4910), and ABA content (stronger when inoculating with LBM1210). In agreement with these results, inoculation with LET4910 downregulated DREB2 and CAT1 genes in plants under water deficiency and upregulated the CYP707A1 gene, while inoculation with LBM1210 strongly upregulated the CYP707A1 gene, which encodes an ABA catabolic enzyme. Conversely, from our results, ethylene metabolism did not seem to be involved in the alleviation of drought stress exerted by the two strains, as the expression of the CTR1 gene was very similar in all treatments and controls.

Among the tested probiotic species, L. plantarum demonstrated superior inhibition on the growth of C. albicans and S. mutans, disruption of virulent biofilm formation with reduced bacteria and exopolysaccharide (EPS) components, and formation of virulent microcolonies structures. Transcriptome analysis (RNA sequencing) further revealed disruption of S. mutans and C. albicans cross-kingdom interactions with added L. plantarum. Genes of S. mutans and C. albicans involved in metabolic pathways (e.g., EPS formation, carbohydrate metabolism, glycan biosynthesis, and metabolism) were significantly downregulated. More significantly, genes related to C. albicans resistance to antifungal medication (ERG4), fungal cell wall chitin remodeling (CHT2), and resistance to oxidative stress (CAT1) were also significantly downregulated.

They inhibit gene expression by associating with 3'-Untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and are thought to regulate a large proportion of protein coding genes. However, it is becoming apparent that miRNA activity is not necessarily always determined by its expression in the cell. MiRNA activity can be affected by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). For example, the RNA-binding protein HuR associates with the 3'UTR of the CAT1 mRNA after stress, counteracting the effect of miR-122. Second, we found that the expression of an RNA-binding protein called Dead end (Dnd1) prohibits the function of several miRNAs by blocking the accessibility of target mRNAs.(2) Dnd1 function is essential for proper development of primordial germ cells (PGCs) in zebrafish and mammals, indicating a crucial role for RBP/miRNA interplay on 3'UTRs of mRNAs in developmental decisions.

Analysis of cat1, cat2, cat3, cat1 cat2, and cat2 cat3 T-DNA mutants revealed that cat2 had the largest effect on activity in both roots and leaves. Root growth was inhibited in all cat2-containing lines, but this inhibition was prevented by growing plants at high CO2 , suggesting that it is mainly an indirect effect of stress at the leaf level. Analysis of double mutants suggested some overlap between CAT2 and CAT3 functions in leaves and CAT1 and CAT2 in seeds. When plants had been grown to a similar developmental stage in short days or long days, equal-time exposure to oxidative stress caused by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of catalase produced a much stronger induction of H2 O2 marker genes in short day plants. Together, our data (a) underline the importance of CAT2 in basal H2 O2 processing in Arabidopsis; (b) suggest that CAT1 and CAT3 are mainly ""backup"" or stress-specific enzymes; and (c) establish that day length-dependent responses to catalase deficiency are independent of the duration of oxidative stress.",1.0

We studied BOA-6-OH- short-term effects on membrane lipids and fatty acids in maize root tips in comparison to the benzoxazinone-free species Abutilon theophrasti Medik. Decreased contents of phosphatidylinositol in A. theophrasti and phosphatidylcholine in maize were found after 10-30 min.

Salt stress led to a lower chlorophyll content, a reduced photosynthetic activity, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents, and decreased photosystem II (PSII) activity. The application of exogenous MT to green bean seedlings under salt stress improved photosynthetic activity and alleviated the oxidative damages by enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes. The expression of catalase (CAT1), glutathione reductase (GR), superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD1), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), Peroxiredoxin Q (PrxQ), and 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin (2-Cys-Prx) encoding genes was significantly increased under salt stress in green bean seedling compared with the untreated control. However, plants treated with exogenous MT and NaCl had 28.8, 21.1, 26.1, 20, 26.2, and 22.4% higher CuZnSOD, CAT1, APX, GR, PrxQ, and 2-Cys-Prx transcript levels, respectively, compared to NaCl stress alone.

In the current work, we describe the adaptation of the CRISPR-Cas9 vector pJOE8999 to enable efficient genome editing in B. megaterium. Crucial modifications comprise the exchange of promoter elements and associated ribosomal binding sites as well as the implementation of a 5-fluorouracil based counterselection system to facilitate proper plasmid curing. In addition, the functionality and performance of the new CRISPR-Cas9 vector pMOE was successfully evaluated by chromosomal disruption studies of the endogenous β-galactosidase gene (BMD_2126) and demonstrated an outstanding efficiency of 100 % based on combinatorial pheno- and genotype analyses. Furthermore, pMOE was applied for the genomic deletion of a steroid esterase gene (BMD_2256) that was identified among several other candidates as the gene encoding the esterase, which prevented accumulation of pharmaceutically important glucocorticoid esters. Recombinant expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase 1 gene (cat1) in the resulting esterase deficient B. megaterium strain ultimately yielded C21-acetylated as well as novel C21-esterified derivates of cortisone.",1.0

Following PepMV inoculation, CAT mRNA and protein levels in leaves were unaltered at 0, 3 and 6 days (locally) and 8 days (systemically) post-inoculation; however, leaf extracts from the last two time points contained increased CAT activity and lower H₂O₂ evels. Overexpression of PepMV p26 in vitro and in planta conferred the same effect, suggesting an additional involvement of TGBp1 in potexvirus pathogenesis. The accumulation of PepMV genomic and subgenomic RNAs and the expression of viral coat protein in noninoculated (systemic) leaves were reduced significantly in CAT-silenced plants.

The expression of the gene is mediated via a TATA-less promoter. In the present study we show that an Sp1 (specificity protein 1)-binding site within a GC-rich region of the Cat-1 gene controls its basal expression and is important for induction of the gene during the UPR (unfolded protein response). We have shown previously that induction of Cat-1 gene expression during the UPR requires phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha (eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha) by PERK (protein-kinase-receptor-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase), one of the signalling pathways activated during the UPR. This leads to increased translation of the transcription factor ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4). We also show that a second signalling pathway is required for sustained transcriptional induction of the Cat-1 gene during the UPR, namely activation of IRE1 (inositol-requiring enzyme 1) leading to alternative splicing of the mRNA for the transcription factor XBP1 (X-box-binding protein 1). The resulting XBP1s (spliced XBP1) can bind to an ERSE (endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-response-element), ERSE-II-like, that was identified within the Cat-1 promoter. Surprisingly, eIF2alpha phosphorylation is required for accumulation of XBP1s. We propose that the signalling via phosphorylated eIF2alpha is required for maximum induction of Cat-1 transcription during the UPR by inducing the accumulation of both ATF4 and XBP1s.",1.0

Dry mature seeds from transgenic plants carrying the CAT1-GUS or CAT2-GUS constructs, in which the GUS gene was fused to the 5'-flanking region of cat1 or cat2, respectively, contained significant GUS activity, indicating that the promoters of cat1 and cat2 were active during seed development. GUS activity increased in response to germination in the seeds of transgenic tobacco that carried CAT1-GUS, as well as in those that carried CAT2-GUS. During the post-germinative stage the GUS activity directed by CAT2-GUS increased still further, whereas that directed by CAT1-GUS decreased. The changes in GUS activity in the transgenic tobacco plants that carried CAT1-GUS and CAT2-GUS were similar to the changes in the levels of transcripts of cat1 and cat2, respectively, in castor bean. The results suggest that the expression of cat1 and cat2 in the germinating seeds and post-germinative seedlings is regulated mainly at the level of transcription. However, the distribution of GUS activity among the organs of the transgenic tobacco seedlings and plantlets, which was examined by histochemical staining and by enzymatic assays of tissue extracts, was not identical to that of transcripts of cat1 and cat2 in castor bean.

The cat1 mutants are unable to form biofilms at levels equivalent to that of the wild type, and there is no impact on the planktonic growth characteristics of the strains, indicating a specific role in biofilm formation. Through time course studies of the static microtiter plate assay, we determined that cat1 mutants are unable to form biofilms equivalent to that of the wild type under all conditions tested. In flow cell experiments, cat1 mutants initially are unable to attach to the surface. Over time, however, they form microcolonies, an architecture very different from that produced by wild-type biofilms.

The introduction of the mtHSC70-1 gene into mthsc70-1a restored the growth and development of roots to the level of the wild type.

A binding site for miR-122 was predicted to reside close to the 5' end of the viral genome, and its functionality was tested by mutational analyses of the miRNA-binding site in viral RNA, resulting in reduced intracellular viral RNA abundance. Importantly, ectopic expression of miR-122 molecules that contained compensatory mutations restored viral RNA abundance, revealing a genetic interaction between miR-122 and the viral RNA genome. Studies with replication-defective viral RNAs demonstrated that miR-122 affected mRNA abundance by positively modulating RNA replication. In contrast, interaction of miR-122 with the 3'-noncoding region (3'NCR) of the cellular mRNA encoding the cationic amino acid transporter CAT-1 resulted in the down-regulation of CAT-1 protein abundance.

In the present study, to investigate the physiological and biochemical stress-induced responses, we overexpressed TdAnn12 in tobacco. We demonstrate that transgenic tobacco plants expressing TdAnn12 exhibited enhanced tolerance to salt, osmotic stress and H2O2 at the seedling stage. Under greenhouse conditions, these plants showed tolerance to drought and salt stresses. Moreover, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), higher chlorophyll content, lower lipid peroxidation levels and increased antioxidant activities (peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase) were observed. Finally, accumulation of TdAnn12 in tobacco positively affects the regulation of some stress-related genes (MnSOD, APX1, CAT1, P5CS, NHX1, SOS1 and DREB1A).

HIFalpha is a transcription factor that mediates the expression of hypoxia-sensitive genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which in turn regulates vasculogenesis. Whereas CUL2 participates in the degradation of HIFalpha, the potential role of CUL2 in the regulation of other cellular processes is less well established. In the present study, suppression of CUL2 expression by Cul2 siRNA inhibited HIFalpha transcriptional activation of the VEGF gene in vitro, indicating that CUL2 plays a role distinct from its known function in HIFalpha degradation. Because ARNT heterodimerizes with HIFalpha, we assessed whether CUL2 influenced ARNT expression. Cul2 siRNA inhibited the expression of endogenous ARNT. Ectopically expressed ARNT reversed the inhibition of HIF activity by Cul2 siRNA in the VEGF promoter, suggesting that CUL2 regulates HIF activation through ARNT. In 786-O cells lacking VHL, Cul2 siRNA suppressed the expression of both ARNT and VEGF, indicating that CUL2 regulates HIF activity independently of VHL. In transgenic zebrafish expressing GFP driven by the Flk promoter (a known HIF target), zCul2 morpholino blocked embryonic vasculogenesis in a manner similar to that caused by inhibition of VEGF-A. In the zebrafish embryos, zCul2 inhibited the expression of CUL2, VEGF, and Flk-GFP protein, indicating that CUL2 is required for expression of other vasculogenic HIF targets.

Genes that encode proteins which interact with the VHL gene product (VHL) provide candidate gatekeeper RCC genes. VHL forms a multimeric complex with two subunits (B and C) of the SIII (elongin) transcriptional elongation complex and CUL2, a member of the cullin family. Most pathogenic VHL mutations inhibit formation of the VHL/elonginB+C/CUL2 complex. A further VHL-binding protein of unknown function, VBP1, fails to bind to truncated forms of VHL. We have investigated the possible roles of CUL2 and VBP1 in renal tumorigenesis by analyzing sporadic RCC of known VHL mutation or hypermethylation status, including CC-RCC without VHL inactivation (n = 40); CC-RCC with VHL inactivation (n = 35); and non-CC-RCC (n = 14). No VBP1 mutations were identified in 89 sporadic RCCs, suggesting that VBP1 is not an RCC gatekeeper gene.

Here, we uncover the molecular mechanism of Arg/C-degron recognition by solving a subset of structures of FEM1 proteins in complex with Arg/C-degron-bearing substrates. Our structural research, complemented by binding assays and global protein stability (GPS) analyses, demonstrates that FEM1A/C and FEM1B selectively target distinct classes of Arg/C-degrons. Overall, our study not only sheds light on the molecular mechanism underlying Arg/C-degron recognition for precise control of substrate turnover, but also provides valuable information for development of chemical probes for selectively regulating proteostasis.",0.0

VHL disease is caused by germline mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 3p25. Tumor development in this setting is due to inactivation or loss of the remaining wild-type allele in a susceptible cell. The highly vascular nature of VHL-associated neoplasms can be understood in light of the recent finding that the VHL gene product (pVHL) inhibits the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs, such as the mRNA encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), under normoxic conditions. This property of pVHL appears to be linked to its ability to bind to complexes containing elongin B, elongin C, and cullin 2 (Cul2). Elongin C and Cul2, based on their homology with Skp1 and Cdc53, respectively, are suspected of targeting certain proteins for covalent modification with ubiquitin and hence for degradation. One model, which remains to be tested, is that the binding of pVHL to elongins B/C and Cul2 affects the ubiquitination of RNA-binding proteins that regulate the stability of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs.",0.0

Here, we investigated the functional role of NLRC5 in the infection of a flavivirus, dengue virus (DENV). We found that the expression of NLRC5 was strongly induced by virus infection and IFNB or IFNG stimulation in different cell lines. Overexpression of NLRC5 remarkably suppressed DENV infection, whereas knockout of NLRC5 led to a significant increase in DENV infection. Mechanistic study revealed that NLRC5 interacted with the viral nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) protease domain and mediated degradation of NS3 through a ubiquitin-dependent selective macroautophagy/autophagy pathway. We demonstrated that NLRC5 recruited the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL2 (cullin 2) to catalyze K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of the NS3 protease domain, which subsequently served as a recognition signal for cargo receptor TOLLIP-mediated selective autophagic degradation. Together, we have demonstrated that NLRC5 exerted an antiviral effect by mediating the degradation of a multifunctional protein of DENV, providing a novel antiviral signal axis of NLRC5-CUL2-NS3-TOLLIP. This study expands our understanding of the regulatory network of NLRC5 in the host defense against virus infection.",0.0

In addition, inflorescence axillary meristems develop into spikelets, but the spikelets at the distal end of the inflorescence have an altered phyllotaxy and are sometimes absent. Double mutant combinations of cul2 and nine other recessive mutations that exhibit low to high tiller number phenotypes resulted in a uniculm vegetative phenotype. One exception was the occasional multiple shoots produced in combination with granum-a; a high tillering mutant that occasionally produces two shoot apical meristems. These results show that the CUL2 gene product plays a role in the development of axillary meristems into tillers but does not regulate the development of vegetative apical meristems. Moreover, novel double-mutant inflorescence phenotypes were observed with cul2 in combination with the other mutants.

Through purification and characterization of a larger collection of BC-box proteins that serve as substrate recognition subunits of Cul2 and Cul5 ubiquitin ligases and through structure-function studies, we define Cul2- and Cul5-boxes in greater detail. Although it previously appeared that there was little sequence similarity between Cul5- and Cul2-box motifs, analyses of newly identified BC-box proteins reveal that residues conserved in the Cul2-box represent a subset of those conserved in the Cul5-box. The sequence motif LPPhiP, which is conserved in most Cul5-boxes and has been suggested to specify assembly of Cul5 ligases, is compatible with Cul2 interaction. Finally, the spacing between BC- and Cullin-boxes is much more flexible than has been appreciated and can vary from as few as 3 and as many as approximately 80 amino acids. Taken together, our findings shed new light on the mechanisms by which BC-box proteins direct recruitment of Cullin-Rbx modules during reconstitution of ubiquitin ligases.",0.0

Rbx1/ROC1/Hrt1, a RING finger protein, functions as an important component of the cullin-containing SCF and VBC-Cul2 ligases. Modification of cullins by NEDD8 (NEDDylation), has been shown to be essential for the E3 activity of both SCF and VBC-Cul2, and it was suggested that Rbx1 acts as the E3 for cullin NEDDylation. RING finger is composed of eight cysteine and histidine residues that bind to zinc ions. Rbx1 is a highly evolutionarily conserved protein; however, the eighth coordination residue in its RING finger is aspartate (D97) rather than cysteine. Substitution of D97 with each of the other 19 amino acids demonstrates that aspartate is superior to cysteine in cullin NEDDylation. Interestingly, however, different D97 mutants demonstrate different activities towards 6 cullins tested. Importantly, we were able to discriminate between the NEDDylating activity of Rbx1 and its involvement in the ubiquitylation reaction within the context of VBC-Cul2. Moreover, while Rbx1 is not involved in governing the stability of SCF, Rbx1 mutants destabilize VBC-Cul2.

We now show that VHL specifically interacts with endogenous Cul2-Rbx1 in mammalian cells, whereas SOCS-box proteins associate with Cul5-Rbx2. We also identify LRR-1 and FEM1B as proteins that share a region of homology with VHL (the VHL box, including the BC box and downstream residues) and associate with Cul2-Rbx1. ECS complexes can thus be classified into two distinct protein assemblies, that is, those that contain a subunit with a VHL box (composed of the BC box and a downstream Cul2 box) that interacts with Cul2-Rbx1, and those that contain a subunit with a SOCS box (BC box and downstream Cul5 box) that interacts with Cul5-Rbx2. Domain-swapping analyses showed that the specificity of interaction of VHL-box and SOCS-box proteins with Cullin-Rbx modules is determined by the Cul2 and Cul5 boxes, respectively. Finally, RNAi-mediated knockdown of the Cul2-Rbx1 inhibited the VHL-mediated degradation of HIF-2alpha, whereas knockdown of Cul5-Rbx2 did not affect it.

However, rare kindreds with familial CCRCC (FCRC) not linked to the VHL tumour suppressor gene have been described suggesting that further familial RCC susceptibility genes exist. To investigate the genetic epidemiology of FCRC, we undertook a clinical and molecular study of FCRC in nine kindreds with two or more cases of CCRCC in first degree relatives. FCRC was characterised by an earlier age at onset (mean 47.1 years, 52% of cases <50 years of age) than sporadic cases. These findings differ from the only previous report of two FCRC kindreds and have important implications for renal surveillance in FCRC. The molecular basis of CCRCC susceptibility was investigated in nine FCRC kindreds and seven isolated cases with features of possible genetic susceptibility to CCRCC (four bilateral CCRCC aged <50 years and three with unilateral CCRCC aged <30 years). No germline mutations were detected in the VHL or MET genes, suggesting that FCRC is not allelic with VHL disease or HPRC.

Seventeen fresh OSCC tumor samples with different tumor sizes (T) were included in the study. Tumors were from the tongue or from the floor of the mouth, and only three patients were nonsmokers. Samples were categorized according to clinical tumor size in tumors ≤2 cm (T1, n = 5) or tumors >2 cm (T2, n = 9; T3, n = 2; T4, n = 1). The group of tumors ≤2 cm was considered the reference group, while the larger tumors were considered the test group. We assessed the expression of 84 cell cycle genes by qRT-PCR array and normalized it to the expression of two housekeeping genes. Results were analyzed according to the formula 2(^-DeltaCt). A five-fold change cutoff was used, and p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Ki-67 immunohistochemistry was performed to estimate cell proliferation index. Twenty-nine genes were downregulated in the test group (larger tumors) compared to the reference group (smaller tumors). Among these genes, 13 reached statistical significance: ANAPC4, CUL1, SUMO1, KPNA2, MAD2L2, CCNG2, E2F4, NBN, CUL2, PCNA, TFDP1, KNTC1, and ATR. Ki-67 labeling index was similar in both tumor groups. Our findings suggest that the transcriptional activity of specific cell cycle genes varies according to the size of OSCC tumor, which probably reflects tumor molecular evolution and adaptation to the microenvironment.",0.0
143,Genomics ,PUBMED: 10857749; ,"Comparative genome analysis may provide novel insights into gene evolution and function. To investigate the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease tumor suppressor gene, we sequenced the VHL gene in seven primate species. Comparative analysis was performed for human, primate, and rodent VHL genes and for a putative Caenorhabditis elegans VHL homologue identified by database analysis. The VHL gene has two translation initiation sites (at codons 1 and 54); however, the relative importance of the full-length translation product (pVHL30) and that translated from the second internal translation initiation site (pVHL19) is unclear. The N-terminal sequence of pVHL30 contains eight copies of a GXEEX acidic repeat motif in human and higher primates, but only three copies were present in the marmoset, and only one copy was present in rodent VHL genes. Evolutionary analysis suggested that the N-terminal repetitive sequence in pVHL30 was of less functional importance than those regions present in both pVHL30 and pVHL19. The VHL gene product is reported to form complexes with various proteins including elongin B, elongin C, VBP-1, fibronectin, Spl, CUL2, and HIF-1. Although most of the regions in pVHL that had been implicated in binding specific proteins demonstrated evolutionary conservation, the carboxy-terminal putative VBP-1 binding site was less well conserved, suggesting that VBP-1 binding may have less functional significance. Although an amino acid substitution (K171T) close to the pVHL elongin binding region was found in baboon, analysis of the structure of human pVHL suggested that this substitution would not interfere with pVHL/elongin C interaction. In general, there was a good correlation between the pVHL domains that demonstrated most evolutionary conservation and those that were most frequently mutated in tumors. Analysis of human/C. elegans conservation and human germline and somatic mutation patterns identified a highly conserved mutation cluster region between codons 74 and 90. However, this region is likely to be important for the structural integrity of pVHL rather than representing an additional protein binding domain.",0.0

Genetically, ccRCC originates from sequential losses of multiple tumor suppressor genes. Remarkably, chromosome 3p loss occurs in more than 90% of sporadic ccRCCs. This results in concurrent one-copy loss of four tumor suppressor genes that are also mutated individually at high frequency in ccRCC (ie, VHL, 80%; PBRM1, 29% to 46%; BAP1, 6% to 19%; and SETD2, 8% to 30%). Pathogenically, 3p loss probably represents the first genetic event that occurs in sporadic ccRCC and the second genetic event in VHL-mutated hereditary ccRCC. VHL constitutes the substrate recognition module of the VCB-Cul2 E3 ligase that degrades HIF1/2α, whereas PBRM1, BAP1, and SETD2 are epigenetic modulators that regulate gene transcription. Because 3p loss and VHL inactivation are nearly universal truncal events in ccRCC, the resulting HIF1/2 signaling overdrive and accompanied tumor hypervascularization probably underlie the therapeutic benefits observed with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors, including sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib, bevacizumab, cabozantinib, and lenvatinib.

NFkappaB plays a critical role in a number of homeostatic processes in multicellular organisms, including the regulation of immunity and cell survival. COMMD proteins inhibit NFkappaB mediated gene expression, and recent mechanistic studies have revealed that COMMD1 controls the ubiquitination of NFkappaB subunits, an event linked to transcriptional termination. COMMD1 binds to a multimeric ubiquitin ligase containing Elongins B/C, Cul2 and SOCS1 (ECS( SOCS1)). In this complex, COMMD1 facilitates the binding of NFkappaB subunits to the ligase, thereby promoting their ubiquitination and degradation. Additional insights gained from these studies indicate that COMMD proteins likely play a broader role in cellular homeostasis through their participation in the ubiquitination pathway.",0.0

Map-based cloning revealed that both mutants are due to allelic mutations in the CsPHB gene, a homolog of the Arabidopsis PHABULOSA which encodes a class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP III) transcription factor. Leaf rolling is an important agronomic trait in crop breeding. Moderate leaf rolling minimizes shadowing between leaves, leading to improved photosynthetic efficiency. Although a number of genes controlling rolled leaf have been identified from rice and other plant species, none have been mapped or cloned in cucurbit crops. In this study, we identified and characterized two curly leaf (cul) mutants, cul-1 and cul-2 in cucumber. With map-based cloning, we show that cul-1 and cul-2 are allelic mutations and CsPHB (Csa6G525430) was the candidate gene for both mutants. The CsPHB gene encoded a class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP III) transcription factor. A single non-synonymous mutation in the fourth and fifth exons of the CsPHB was responsible for the cul-1 and cul-2 mutant phenotypes, respectively. The single-nucleotide substitutions in cul-1 and cul-2 were both located in cs-miRNA165/166 complementary sites of CsPHB. The expression level of CsPHB gene in multiple organs of cul-1 and cul-2 mutants was higher than that in the wild type, while the expression of cs-miRNA165/166 in the two genotypes showed the opposite trend. We speculate that disruption of the binding between the mutant allele of CsPHB and cs-miRNA165/166 leads to the curly-leaf phenotype. This is the first report to clone and characterize the CsPHB gene in the family Cucurbitaceae. Taken together, these results support CsPHB as an important player in the modulation of leaf shape development in cucumber.",0.0

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) represents the most prevalent methylation modification of lncRNAs and has been shown to play important roles in the pathophysiological processes of tumors. However, the distribution and function of m6A modifications in lncRNAs in GBM tissues have not been fully revealed. Methods: The global depiction of m6A-modified lncRNA expression patterns in GBM tumor tissues was screened via m6A high-throughput sequencing. Gain- and loss-of-function assays were performed to investigate the role of WEE2-AS1 in GBM. Mass spectrometry and RNA-pulldown, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), luciferase reporter and coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed to explore the mechanism of m6A-mediated upregulation of WEE2-AS1 expression and the downstream mechanism promoting the malignant progression of GBM. Results: Herein, we report the differential expression profile of m6A-modified lncRNAs in human GBM tissues for the first time. WEE2-AS1 was identified as a novel m6A-modified lncRNA that promotes GBM progression and was post-transcriptionally stabilized by IGF2BP3, an m6A reader. Moreover, we confirmed that WEE2-AS1 promoted RPN2 protein stabilization by preventing CUL2-mediated RPN2 K322 ubiquitination, thereby contributing to GBM malignant progression by activating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. In translational medicine, we found that blocking WEE2-AS1 expression improved the therapeutic sensitivity of dasatinib, a central nervous system penetrant that is FDA-approved in GBM. Conclusions: Overall, this work highlights that WEE2-AS1 may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in GBM, the knockdown of which significantly improves the efficacy of dasatinib, providing a promising strategy for improving targeted combination therapy for GBM patients.",0.0

Blood samples and physiological phenotypes of TEAs and 32 matched non-alpinist Tibetan volunteers (non-TEAs) are collected for analysis. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis identifies 23,202 differentially methylated CpGs (Padj < 0.05, |β| > 0.1) between the two groups.

We also identified a Cul2-box motif used for Cul2 selection in all Cul2-based complexes. With this information, we set out to determine if other adenoviruses also possess the ability to form the ligase complex and, if so, to predict their Cullin usage. Here we report that all adenoviruses known to encode an E4orf6-like protein (mastadenoviruses and atadenoviruses) maintain the potential to form the ligase complex.

Interestingly, in nonhuman primate adenoviruses, we found a clear segregation of Cullin binding, with Cul5 utilized by viruses infecting great apes and Cul2 by Old/New World monkey viruses, suggesting that a switch from Cul2 to Cul5 binding occurred during the period when great apes diverged from monkeys. Based on the analysis of Cullin selection, we also suggest that the majority of human adenoviruses, which exhibit a broader tropism for the eye and the respiratory tract, exhibit Cul5 specificity and resemble viruses infecting great apes, whereas those that infect the gastrointestinal tract may have originated from monkey viruses that share Cul2 specificity. Finally, aviadenoviruses also appear to contain E4orf6 genes that encode proteins with a conserved XCXC motif followed by, in most cases, a BC-box motif.",0.0

The aim of this study is to explore the key candidate genes and pathways in PAH associated with congenital heart disease (CHD-PAH), PAH associated with connective tissue disease (CTD-PAH), and idiopathic PAH (IPAH). We performed differential expression analysis based on a public microarray dataset GSE113439 and identified 1,442 differentially expressed genes, of which 80.3% were upregulated.

Interactions between HPV E7 and host cell proteins can also drive cancer progression. We hypothesize that HPV E7-host protein interactions specific for high-risk E7 contribute to the carcinogenic activity of high-risk HPV. The cellular protein ZER1 interacts with the E7 protein from HPV16, the genotype most frequently associated with human cancers. The HPV16 E7-ZER1 interaction is unique among HPV E7 tested to date. Other E7 proteins, even from closely related HPV genotypes, do not bind ZER1, which is a substrate specificity factor for a CUL2-RING ubiquitin ligase. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of ZER1 to the carcinogenic activity of HPV16 E7. First, we mapped the ZER1 binding site to specific residues on the C terminus of HPV16 E7. We showed that the mutant HPV16 E7 that cannot bind ZER1 is impaired in the ability to promote the growth of primary keratinocytes. We found that ZER1 and CUL2 contribute to, but are not required for, HPV16 E7 to degrade RB1. Cancer dependency data show that ZER1 is an essential gene in most HPV-positive, but not HPV-negative, cancer cell lines. Depleting ZER1 impaired the growth of primary keratinocytes expressing HPV16 E7 or HPV18 E7 and of HPV16-and HPV18-positive cervical cancer cell lines. Taken together, our work demonstrates that ZER1 contributes to HPV-mediated carcinogenesis and is essential for the growth of HPV-positive cells. IMPORTANCE HPV16 is highly carcinogenic and is the most predominant HPV genotype associated with human cancers. The mechanisms that underlie differences between high-risk HPV genotypes are currently unknown, but many of these differences are likely attributable to the activities of the oncogenic HPV proteins, including E7. The HPV E7 oncoprotein is essential for HPV-mediated carcinogenesis. A large number of HPV E7 targets have been identified. However, it is unclear which of these many interactions contributes to the carcinogenic activity of HPV E7. Here, we characterized the interaction between HPV16 E7 and the host cell protein ZER1, testing whether this genotype-specific interaction could enable some of the carcinogenic activity of HPV16 E7. We found that ZER1 binding contributes to the growth-promoting activity of HPV16 E7 and to the growth of HPV-positive cervical cancer cells.

Here, we identified Cullin 2 and USP2 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase-2) as novel regulators of antithrombin expression that act by modulating antithrombin ubiquitination. Inhibition of the proteasome caused accumulation of antithrombin and its ubiquitinated forms in HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells. Notably, inhibition of neddylation with MLN4924 suppressed both ubiquitination and degradation of antithrombin, which is recapitulated by silencing of the neddylation enzymes, NAE1, UBA3, and UBE2M, with small interfering RNA (siRNA). We identified Cullin 2 as the interaction partner of antithrombin, and siRNA-mediated Cullin 2 knockdown reduced antithrombin ubiquitination and increased antithrombin protein. We further found that USP2 interacted with antithrombin and regulated antithrombin expression, showing that overexpression of USP2 inhibits the ubiquitination and proteasomal clearance of antithrombin, whereas pharmacological inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown of USP2 downregulates antithrombin.

A genetic screen for cul2 suppressors recovered two recessive alleles of ELIGULUM-A (ELI-A) that partially rescued the cul2 tillering phenotype. Mutations in ELI-A produce shorter plants with fewer tillers and disrupt the leaf blade-sheath boundary, producing liguleless leaves and reduced secondary cell wall development in stems and leaves. ELI-A is predicted to encode an unannotated protein containing an RNaseH-like domain that is conserved in land plants. ELI-A transcripts accumulate at the preligule boundary, the developing ligule, leaf margins, cells destined to develop secondary cell walls, and cells surrounding leaf vascular bundles. Recent studies have identified regulatory similarities between boundary development in leaves and lateral organs. Interestingly, we observed ELI-A transcripts at the preligule boundary, suggesting that ELI-A contributes to boundary formation between the blade and sheath. However, we did not observe ELI-A transcripts at the axillary meristem boundary in leaf axils, suggesting that ELI-A is not involved in boundary development for axillary meristem development.

The VHL gene was localized to 3p25 and then isolated by Latif et al. (1). The gene contains three exons with an open reading frame of 852 nucleotides, which encode a predicted protein of 284 amino acids. The VHL protein is believed to have several functions.

This complex then overcomes ""pausing"" of RNA polymerase during mRNA transcription (2,3). Several studies suggest that the VHL protein is also involved in regulation of hypoxia-inducible transcripts, particularly vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), by altering mRNA stability (4,5).

Leveraging the catalytic nature of the ubiquitin-proteasome enzymatic machinery, TPD exhibits higher potency to eliminate disease-causing target proteins such as oncogenic transcription factors that may otherwise be difficult to abrogate by conventional inhibitors. However, there are challenges that remain. Currently, nearly all degraders engage CUL4CRBN or CUL2VHL as the E3 ligase for target ubiquitination. While their immediate efficacies are evident, the narrowed E3 ligase options make TPD vulnerable to potential drug resistance. In addition, E3 ligases show differential tissue expression and have intrinsic limitations in accessing varying types of disease-relevant targets. As the success of TPD is closely associated with the ability of E3 ligases to efficiently polyubiquitinate the target of interest, the long-term outlook of TPD drug development will depend on whether E3 ligases such as CUL4CRBN and CUL2VHL are accessible to the targets of interest.

Here, we show that p62 knockdown reduces cell growth and the expression of glycolytic genes in a manner that depends on HIF1α activity in renal cancer cells. Knockdown of p62 decreases HIF1α levels and transcriptional activity by regulating mTORC1 activity and NF-κB nuclear translocation. Furthermore, p62 interacts directly with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase complex to modulate the stability of HIF1α. Mechanistically, p62 binds to the VHL complex and competes with HIF1α. Expression of p62 inhibits the interaction of DCNL1 (also known as DCUN1D1) with CUL2 and attenuates the neddylation of CUL2, and thus downregulates the VHL E3 ligase complex activity.

In addition, several type-specific VHL disease-causing mutants, including those that have retained proper binding and regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor α, showed a severe defect in binding prolyl hydroxylated EPOR peptides.

A preponderance of the tumor-disposing inherited missense mutations detected in VHL disease are within the elongin-binding domain of VHL. This region mediates the formation of a multiprotein VHL complex containing elongin B, elongin C, cul-2, and Rbx1. This VHL complex is thought to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Here, we report that VHL proteins harboring mutations which disrupt elongin binding are unstable and rapidly degraded by the proteasome. In contrast, wild-type VHL proteins are directly stabilized by associating with both elongins B and C. In addition, elongins B and C are stabilized through their interactions with each other and VHL. Thus, the entire VHL/elongin complex is resistant to proteasomal degradation. Because the elongin-binding domain of VHL is frequently mutated in cancers, these results suggest that loss of elongin binding causes tumorigenesis by compromising VHL protein stability and/or potential VHL ubiquitination functions.",0.0

Blocking the interaction of pVHL with elongin B/C resulted in accumulation of pVHL within the CCT complex. pVHL present in purified VHL-CCT complexes, when added to rabbit reticulocyte lysate, proceeded to form VCB and VCB-Cul2. Thus, CCT likely functions, at least in part, by retaining VHL chains pending the availability of elongin B/C for final folding and/or assembly. Tumor-associated mutations within exon II of the VHL syndrome had diverse effects upon the stability and/or function of pVHL-containing complexes. First, a pVHL mutant lacking the entire region encoded by exon II did not bind to CCT and yet could still assemble into complexes with elongin B/C and elongin B/C-Cul2. Second, a number of tumor-derived missense mutations in exon II did not decrease CCT binding, and most had no detectable effect upon VCB-Cul2 assembly. Many exon II mutants, however, were found to be defective in the binding to and subsequent ubiquitination of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha), a substrate of the VCB-Cul2 ubiquitin ligase.

SAMHD1 knockdown using shRNA increased the activity of the viral UL99 late gene promoter in human fibroblasts by 7- to 9-fold, confirming its anti-HCMV activity. We also found that the level of SAMHD1 was initially increased by HCMV infection but decreased partly at the protein level at late stages of infection. SAMHD1 loss was not observed with UV-inactivated virus and required viral DNA replication. This reduction of SAMHD1 was effectively blocked by MLN4924, an inhibitor of the Cullin-RING-E3 ligase (CRL) complexes, but not by bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of vacuolar-type H+-ATPase. Indirect immunofluorescence assays further supported the CRL-mediated SAMHD1 loss at late stages of virus infection. Knockdown of CUL2 and to a lesser extent CUL1 using siRNA stabilized SAMHD1 in normal fibroblasts and inhibited SAMHD1 loss during virus infection.

However, the ancestral clade remains less studied, a potential result of genetic redundancies in mammals. Use of the genetically tractable organism Drosophila melanogaster enables in vivo assessment of signaling components and mechanisms with less concern about the functional redundancy observed in mammals. In this study, we investigated how the SOCS family member Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling at 36E (Socs36E) attenuates Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (Jak/STAT) activation during specification of motile border cells in Drosophila oogenesis. We found that Socs36E genetically interacts with the Cullin2 (Cul2) scaffolding protein. Like Socs36E, Cul2 is required to limit the number of motile cells in egg chambers. We demonstrated that loss of Cul2 in the follicle cells significantly increased nuclear STAT protein levels, which resulted in additional cells acquiring invasive properties. Further, reduction of Cul2 suppressed border cell migration defects that occur in a Stat92E-sensitized genetic background. Our data incorporated Cul2 into a previously described Jak/STAT-directed genetic regulatory network that is required to generate a discrete boundary between cell fates.

While NaBu treatment enhanced product yields more than the 1,3,4-O-Bu3 ManNAc treatment, the NaBu treated cells also exhibited higher levels of caspase 3 positive cells using microscopy analysis. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of four cell apoptosis genes (Cul2, BAK, BAX, and BCL2L11) were up-regulated more in sodium butyrate treated wild-type, erythropoietin, or IgG expressing CHO-K1 cell lines while most of the mRNA levels of apoptosis genes in 1,3,4-O-Bu3 ManNAc treated cell lines remained equal or increased only slightly compared to the levels in untreated CHO cell lines. Finally, lectin blot analysis revealed that the 1,3,4-O-Bu3 ManNAc-treated cells displayed higher relative sialylation levels on recombinant EPO, consistent with the effect of the ManNAc component of this additive, compared to control while NaBu treatment led to lower sialylation levels than control, or 1,3,4-O-Bu3 ManNAc-treatment.

Here we combine bioinformatics analysis and quantitative proteomics to discover a new class of viral ANK proteins with a domain organization that relates to cellular ANK proteins. These noncanonical viral ANK proteins, termed ANK/BC, interact with host Cullin-2 via a C-terminal BC box resembling that of cellular Cullin-2 substrate adaptors such as the von Hippel-Lindau protein. Mutagenesis of the BC box-like sequence abrogates binding to Cullin-2, whereas fusion of this motif to an ANK-only protein confers Cullin-2 association. We demonstrated that these viral ANK/BC proteins are potent immunomodulatory proteins suppressing the activation of the proinflammatory transcription factors NF-κB and interferon (IFN)-responsive factor 3 (IRF-3) and the production of cytokines and chemokines, including interferon, and that association with Cullin-2 is required for optimal inhibitory activity.

ANK/BC proteins target the host E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin-2 via a C-terminal BC box domain and are potent suppressors of the production of inflammatory cytokines, including interferon. The existence of cellular ANK proteins whose architecture is similar suggests the acquisition of a host ANK/BC gene by an ancestral orthopoxvirus and its subsequent duplication and adaptation to widen the repertoire of immune evasion strategies.",0.0

The UBX proteins that bind ubiquitin conjugates also interact with dozens of E3 ubiquitin ligases, only one of which had been previously linked to p97. In particular, UBXD7 links p97 to the ubiquitin ligase CUL2/VHL and its substrate hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha).

In cancer cells, many promoters become aberrantly methylated through the activity of the de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3a and DNMT3b and acquire repressive chromatin marks. NEDD8 is a ubiquitin-like protein modifier that is conjugated to target proteins, such as cullins, to regulate their activity, and cullin 4A (CUL4A) in its NEDD8-modified form is essential for repressive chromatin formation. We found that DNMT3b associates with NEDD8-modified proteins. Whereas DNMT3b interacts directly in vitro with NEDD8, conjugation of NEDD8 to target proteins enhances this interaction in vivo. DNMT3b immunoprecipitated two major bands of endogenously NEDDylated proteins at the size of NEDDylated cullins, and indeed DNMT3b interacted with CUL1, CUL2, CUL3, CUL4A, and CUL5. Moreover, DNMT3b preferentially immunoprecipitated the NEDDylated form of endogenous CUL4A. NEDD8 enhanced DNMT3b-dependent DNA methylation.

Consistent with this, we find that both GCN5 and the IkappaB Kinase (IKK) complex promote RelA degradation.

Deficiencies in sterol biosynthesis cause pleiotropic defects that limit cellular proliferation and adaptation to stress. Thereby, fungal ergosterol levels are tightly controlled by the bioavailability of particular metabolites (e.g., sterols, oxygen and iron) and environmental conditions. The regulation of ergosterol synthesis is achieved by overlapping mechanisms that include transcriptional expression, feedback inhibition of enzymes and changes in their subcellular localization. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the sterol regulatory element (SRE)-binding proteins Upc2 and Ecm22, the heme-binding protein Hap1 and the repressor factors Rox1 and Mot3 coordinate ergosterol biosynthesis (ERG) gene expression.

FASN-mutant cells show a strong dependence on lipid uptake that is reflected in negative GIs with genes involved in the LDL receptor pathway, vesicle trafficking and protein glycosylation. Further support for these functional relationships is derived from additional GI screens in query cell lines deficient in other genes involved in lipid metabolism, including LDLR, SREBF1, SREBF2 and ACACA.

Through unbiased genome-wide RNA interference screening, we identified huntingtin associated protein 1 (HAP1) as an ALL biomarker for l-asparaginase resistance. Knocking down HAP1 induces l-asparaginase resistance. HAP1 interacts with huntingtin and the intracellular Ca2+ channel, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor to form a ternary complex that mediates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ release upon stimulation with inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate3 Loss of HAP1 prevents the formation of the ternary complex and thus l-asparaginase-mediated ER Ca2+ release. HAP1 loss also inhibits external Ca2+ entry, blocking an excessive rise in [Ca2+]i, and reduces activation of the Ca2+-dependent calpain-1, Bid, and caspase-3 and caspase-12, leading to reduced number of apoptotic cells. These findings indicate that HAP1 loss prevents l-asparaginase-induced apoptosis through downregulation of the Ca2+-mediated calpain-1-Bid-caspase-3/12 apoptotic pathway. Treatment with BAPTA-AM [1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester)] reverses the l-asparaginase apoptotic effect in control cells, supporting a link between l-asparaginase-induced [Ca2+]i increase and apoptotic cell death.

Strikingly, knocking down of HAP1 alleviated aberrant autophagy in primary neurons from AS mice.

Further, we found that repression by Hap1 requires the function of Hsp70 (Ssa), but not Hsp90. These results show that Hap1 binds to its own promoter and represses transcription in a heme-independent but Hsp70-dependent manner.",0.0

Here we report that adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction-mediated depletion of Hap1, the first identified huntingtin-associated protein, in adult HD knock-in (KI) mouse brains leads to selective neuronal loss in the striatum. Further, Hap1 depletion-mediated neuronal loss via AAV transduction requires the presence of mutant HTT. Rhes, a GTPase that is enriched in the striatum and sumoylates mutant HTT to mediate neurotoxicity, binds more N-terminal HTT when Hap1 is deficient. Consistently, more soluble and sumoylated N-terminal HTT is presented in HD KI mouse striatum when HAP1 is absent. Our findings suggest that both Rhes and Hap1 as well as cellular stress contribute to the preferential neurodegeneration in HD, highlighting the involvement of multiple factors in selective neurodegeneration.",0.0

We found that C-terminal ligand-binding domains of all SHRs had potential for colocalization with HAP1/STBs, whereas only AR and GR were clearly colocalized with HAP1/STBs when each full-length SHR was coexpressed with HAP1. In addition, it appeared that HAP1/STBs did not disrupt GR and AR functions because the receptors on HAP1/STBs maintained nuclear translocation activity in response to their specific ligands. When the cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor, GR and AR localized outside HAP1/STBs translocated into the nucleus, whereas the receptors colocalized with HAP1/STBs persisted in their colocalization even after treatment with their ligands. Therefore, HAP1/STBs may be involved in cytoplasmic modifications of the nuclear translocation of GR and AR in a ubiquitin-proteasome system.",0.0

A decline in these lipids has been observed in such diseases as Alzheimer's and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Plasmalogens contain a characteristic 1-O-alk-1'-enyl ether (vinyl ether) double bond that confers special biophysical, biochemical, and chemical properties to these lipids. However, the genetics of their biosynthesis is not fully understood, since no gene has been identified that encodes plasmanylethanolamine desaturase (E.C. 1.14.99.19), the enzyme introducing the crucial alk-1'-enyl ether double bond. The present work identifies this gene as transmembrane protein 189 (TMEM189). Inactivation of the TMEM189 gene in human HAP1 cells led to a total loss of plasmanylethanolamine desaturase activity, strongly decreased plasmalogen levels, and accumulation of plasmanylethanolamine substrates and resulted in an inability of these cells to form labeled plasmalogens from labeled alkylglycerols. Transient expression of TMEM189 protein, but not of other selected desaturases, recovered this deficit. TMEM189 proteins contain a conserved protein motif (pfam10520) with eight conserved histidines that is shared by an alternative type of plant desaturase but not by other mammalian proteins. Each of these histidines is essential for plasmanylethanolamine desaturase activity. Mice homozygous for an inactivated Tmem189 gene lacked plasmanylethanolamine desaturase activity and had dramatically lowered plasmalogen levels in their tissues. These results assign the TMEM189 gene to plasmanylethanolamine desaturase and suggest that the previously characterized phenotype of Tmem189-deficient mice may be caused by a lack of plasmalogens.",0.0

While over 100 mutations have been implicated in STAT1 GOF, genotype-phenotype correlation remains limited, and current overexpression models may be of limited use in gene expression studies. We generated heterozygous mutants in diploid HAP1 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 base-editing, targeting the endogenous STAT1 gene. Our models recapitulated the molecular phenotype of elevated pSTAT1, and were used to characterize the expression of five IFN-stimulated genes under a number of conditions. At baseline, transcriptional polarization was evident among mutants compared with wild type, and this was maintained following prolonged serum starvation. This suggests a possible role for unphosphorylated STAT1 in the pathogenesis of STAT1 GOF. Following stimulation with IFNα or IFNγ, differential patterns of gene expression emerged among mutants, including both gain and loss of transcriptional function. This work highlights the importance of modeling heterozygous conditions, and in particular transcription factor-related disorders, in a manner which accurately reflects patient genotype and molecular signature.

The yeast heme activator protein Hap1 promotes transcription of many genes in response to heme. It requires Hsp90 and Hsp70 molecular chaperones for its activity to be precisely regulated by heme concentration. The mechanism by which molecular chaperones promote heme regulation of Hap1 activity is distinct from the mechanism by which molecular chaperones promote steroid signaling.

Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1), a key mediator of pathological alterations in protein trafficking, directly interacts with GABAARs and facilitates their recycling back to synapses after internalization from the surface; thus, HAP1 regulates the strength of inhibitory synaptic transmission. Here, we show that HAP1 modulates epileptic seizures by regulating GABAAR function in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and in the pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced epileptic model. We demonstrate that GABAARβ2/3 and HAP1 expression are decreased and that the HAP1-GABAARβ2/3 complex is disrupted in the epileptic rat brain. We found that HAP1 upregulation exerts antiepileptic activity in the PTZ-induced seizure and that these changes are associated with increased surface GABAARβ2/3 expression and the amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs).

The screen revealed several candidate genes, including those involved in Golgi trafficking, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis. We validated the role of a set of vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) genes during infection, VPS51 to VPS54 (VPS51-54), which comprise the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex. The GARP complex is a tethering complex involved in retrograde transport of endosomes to the trans-Golgi apparatus. Our data demonstrate that VPS52 and VPS54 were dispensable for mature virion (MV) production but were required for extracellular virus (EV) formation. For comparison, a known antiviral compound, ST-246, was used in our experiments, demonstrating that EV titers in VPS52 and VPS54 knockout (KO) cells were comparable to levels exhibited by ST-246-treated wild-type cells. Confocal microscopy was used to examine actin tail formation, one of the viral egress mechanisms for cell-to-cell dissemination, and revealed an absence of actin tails in VPS52KO- or VPS54KO-infected cells. Further evaluation of these cells by electron microscopy demonstrated a decrease in levels of wrapped viruses (WVs) compared to those seen with the wild-type control.

We have applied this technique to analyze the infection of HeLa cells by Vaccinia virus, in an attempt to find genes necessary for infection. Infection of cell populations harboring single gene inactivations resulted in no surviving cells, suggesting that no single gene knock-out was able to provide complete resistance to Vaccinia virus and thus allow cells to survive infection. In the absence of an absolute infection blockage, we explored if some gene inactivations could provide partial protection leading to a reduced probability of infection. Multiple experiments using modified screening procedures involving replication restricted viruses led to the identification of multiple genes whose inactivation potentially increase resistance to infection and therefore cell survival. As expected, significant gene hits were related to proteins known to act in virus entry, such as ITGB1 and AXL as well as genes belonging to their downstream related pathways. Additionally, we consistently found β2-microglobulin, encoded by the B2M gene, among the screening top hits, a novel finding that was further explored.

To gain additional insight into the C. albicans heme uptake pathway, we performed an unbiased genetic selection for mutants resistant to the toxic heme analog Ga3+-protoporphyrin IX at neutral pH, and a secondary screen for inability to utilize heme as iron source.

A total of 9690 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the different developmental stages. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses showed that these DEGs were involved mainly in hydrolase activity, structural molecule activity and oxidoreductase activity as well as xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism and energy metabolism pathways.

Whereas cohesin has roles in many cancer-related pathways, such as chromosome instability, DNA repair and gene expression, the complex nature of cohesin function has made it difficult to determine how STAG2 loss might either promote tumorigenesis or be leveraged therapeutically across divergent cancer types. Here, we have performed whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screens for STAG2-dependent genetic interactions in three distinct cellular backgrounds. Surprisingly, STAG1, the paralog of STAG2, was the only negative genetic interaction that was shared across all three backgrounds.

249,Molecular and cellular biology ,PUBMED: 17785431; ,"Changes in oxygen levels cause widespread changes in gene expression in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this response is mediated in part by Hap1, originally identified as a heme-dependent transcriptional activator that functions during aerobic growth. We show here that Hap1 also plays a significant and direct role under hypoxic conditions, not as an activator, but as a repressor. The repressive activity of Hap1 controls several genes, including three ERG genes required for ergosterol biosynthesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Hap1 binds to the ERG gene promoters, while additional experiments showed that the corepressor Tup1/Ssn6 is recruited by Hap1 and is also required for repression. Furthermore, mutational analysis demonstrated that conserved Hap1 binding sites in the ERG5 5' regulatory region are required for repression. The switch of Hap1 from acting as a hypoxic repressor to an aerobic activator is determined by heme, which is synthesized only in the presence of oxygen. The ability of Hap1 to function as a ligand-dependent repressor and activator is a property shared with mammalian nuclear hormone receptors and likely allows greater transcriptional control by Hap1 in response to changing oxygen levels.",0.0

Moreover, CST/Met (-) significantly induced BTG1 expression. Using a BTG1 promoter-harboring reporter gene and siRNA, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) was identified as an essential transcription factor for CST/Met (-)-mediated BTG1 induction. Although knockout of BTG1 in human HAP1 cells did not affect the accumulation of reactive oxygen species induced by CST/Met (-), BTG1 knockout significantly decreased the induction of genes associated with the integrated stress response, and reduced lipid peroxidation and cell death in response to CST/Met (-).

While pan- and class-specific HDAC inhibitors are available, these drugs do not allow a comprehensive understanding of individual HDAC function, or the therapeutic potential of isoform-specific targeting. To systematically compare the impact of individual catalytic functions of HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3, we generated human HAP1 cell lines expressing catalytically inactive HDAC enzymes. Using this genetic toolbox we compare the effect of individual HDAC inhibition with the effects of class I specific inhibitors on cell viability, protein acetylation and gene expression. Individual inactivation of HDAC1 or HDAC2 has only mild effects on cell viability, while HDAC3 inactivation or loss results in DNA damage and apoptosis. Inactivation of HDAC1/HDAC2 led to increased acetylation of components of the COREST co-repressor complex, reduced deacetylase activity associated with this complex and derepression of neuronal genes. HDAC3 controls the acetylation of nuclear hormone receptor associated proteins and the expression of nuclear hormone receptor regulated genes. Acetylation of specific histone acetyltransferases and HDACs is sensitive to inactivation of HDAC1/HDAC2. Over a wide range of assays, we determined that in particular HDAC1 or HDAC2 catalytic inactivation mimics class I specific HDAC inhibitors. Importantly, we further demonstrate that catalytic inactivation of HDAC1 or HDAC2 sensitizes cells to specific cancer drugs. In summary, our systematic study revealed isoform-specific roles of HDAC1/2/3 catalytic functions.

To confirm this, we constructed a strain X2180 derivative (strain HX) that contained the wild-type HAP1 genes originating from strain K7. The expression levels of ergosterol-related genes and cellular ergosterol content in strain HX were higher than those in strain X2180 and were almost comparable to those in strain K7. These results suggest that the differences in the expression levels of ergosterol-related genes and ergosterol content between strains K7 and X2180 were largely caused by the hap1 mutation in strain X2180.

The first is made up of genes regulated by heme, and the second is made up of genes whose regulation is heme independent. Heme-regulated genes fall into two classes: heme-activated and heme-repressed genes. Activation is achieved through one of two transcriptional activators, the heme-dependent HAP1 protein or the heme-activated, glucose-repressed HAP2/3/4 complex. Some of the properties and the DNA-binding sites of these activators are discussed. Heme repression is achieved through the action of the ROX1 repressor, the expression of which is transcriptionally activated by heme. Once ROX1 is synthesized, its function is heme independent. Evidence that ROX1 binds to DNA or is part of a DNA-binding complex is described. Factors which modulate the function of these regulatory proteins are discussed, and a schematic of heme activation and repression is presented. The mitochondrial subunits of cytochrome c oxidase are induced by oxygen in a heme-independent fashion. The translation of one, cytochrome c oxidase subunit III, is dependent upon three nucleus-encoded initiation factors. One of these, PET494, is itself translationally regulated by oxygen in a heme-independent fashion. The expression of at least four other mitochondrially encoded cytochrome subunits is dependent upon specific translation factors, raising the potential for translational regulation as a general mechanism. Finally, a number of anaerobic genes that show heme-independent, oxygen-repressed expression have been identified.

RNA-seq data demonstrated a total of 57 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with 35 up-regulated and 22 down-regulated between SCs treated with IL-1β, and control SCs without treatment. Bioinformatics analysis showed that key upregulated DEGs included those associated with immune and inflammation-related processes, neurotrophin production and SC proliferation. Five proteins encoded by key upregulated DEGs (Ceacam1, Hap1, Irs3, Lgi4 and Mif) were further verified by Western blot. Consistent with the RNA-Seq results, the expression of key genes was confirmed in SCs by immunofluorescence of the chronic constriction injury (CCI) sciatic nerve in rats.

Through expression analysis in semi-haploid HAP1 cell lines genetically engineered in order to knockout (KO) either the uVNTR, dVNTR, or both VNTRs, we assessed the effect of the two MAOA VNTRs, either alone or in combination, on gene expression directed from the different TSSs. Complementing our functional analysis, we determined the haplotype variation of these VNTRs in the general population. The expression of the two MAOA isoforms was differentially modulated by the two VNTRs located in the promoter region. The most extensively studied uVNTR, previously considered a positive regulator of the MAOA gene, did not modulate the expression of what it is considered the canonical isoform, while we found that the dVNTR positively regulated this isoform in our model. In contrast, both the uVNTR and the dVNTR were found to act as negative regulators of the second less abundant MAOA isoform. The haplotype analysis for these two VNTRs demonstrated a bias against the presence of one of the potential variants.

However, connecting differences in gene expression across individuals to higher-order organismal traits is not trivial. In many cases, gene expression variation may be evolutionarily neutral, and in other cases expression variation may only affect phenotype under specific conditions. To understand connections between gene expression variation and stress defense phenotypes, we have been leveraging extensive natural variation in the gene expression response to acute ethanol in laboratory and wild Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. Previous work found that the genetic architecture underlying these expression differences included dozens of ""hotspot"" loci that affected many transcripts in trans. In the present study, we provide new evidence that one of these expression QTL hotspot loci affects natural variation in one particular stress defense phenotype-ethanol-induced cross protection against severe doses of H2O2. A major causative polymorphism is in the heme-activated transcription factor Hap1p, which we show directly impacts cross protection, but not the basal H2O2 resistance of unstressed cells. This provides further support that distinct cellular mechanisms underlie basal and acquired stress resistance. We also show that Hap1p-dependent cross protection relies on novel regulation of cytosolic catalase T (Ctt1p) during ethanol stress in a wild oak strain. Because ethanol accumulation precedes aerobic respiration and accompanying reactive oxygen species formation, wild strains with the ability to anticipate impending oxidative stress would likely be at an advantage.

Identification of the human homologue of HAP1 is necessary for investigation of the potential role of HAP1 in HD pathology.

Indeed, the balancing selection region covers a predicted transcriptional enhancer. In humans, but not in macaques and chimpanzees, THBS4 brain expression increases with age, and variants in the balancing selection region interact with sex in influencing THBS4 expression (pinteraction = 0.038), with hap1 homozygous females showing lowest expression.

However, studies on the relationship between CaSR gene and growth traits in cattle are deficient. The aim of this study was to examine the association of the CaSR polymorphism with growth traits in cattle breeds. Four novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one previously reported SNP (NC_007299.5: g.67630865T>C, 67638409G>C, 67660395G>C, 67661546C>G, and 67661892A>C) were identified in the bovine CaSR gene using DNA sequencing and PCR-SSCP methods in 520 individuals from three representative breeds. The three SNP P4_2, P7_1, and P7_4 in LX, QC, and JX cattle populations belonged to intermediate genetic diversity (0.25 < PIC < 0.5). In addition, we evaluated the haplotype frequency and linkage disequilibrium coefficient of five sequence variants in the three cattle breeds. LD and haplotype structure of CaSR were different between breeds. LD analysis showed that the P4_2 and P7_4 loci were in complete LD in JX cattle population (r2 = 0.99 and D' = 1). Only 11 haplotypes were listed except for those with a frequency of <0.03. Hap1 (-TGGGC-) had the highest haplotype frequencies in LX (27.30%), Hap6(-TGGCC-) had the highest haplotype frequencies in QC (21.70%) and JX (32.30%). Association analysis indicated that P2, P4_2, and P7_4 loci were all significantly associated with growth traits and combined genotype TTGCGC was highly significantly associated with Chest circumference and body weight than the other genotype in JX cattle population. The results of this study suggest that the CaSR gene possibly is a strong candidate gene that affects growth traits in the Chinese cattle breeding program.",0.0

Its cytoplasmic tail, physically associated with a protein tyrosine kinase, is important in the activation of helper/inducer T lymphocytes. In Bos taurus, CD4 gene is located on chromosome 5 from which two isoforms are transcribed, with a different number of amino acids due to splicing of exon 7 and variation in the reading frame. The aim of this study was to investigate the sequence of the entire CD4 gene in Simmental sires to evaluate the effects of genomic variants on the indexes of the bulls for milk, fat and protein yields, as well as somatic cell score. The associations among genomic variants and indexes were analysed using the Allele and GLM procedures of SAS 9.4. The analysis indicated that only four of the thirty-one identified SNPs influenced the considered traits. Identified variants insist on coding zones and intronic sequences, where we revealed the presence of sites for transcription factors. To evaluate the existence of haplotypic effects, combinations among the four genomic variants (SNP 3, SNP 8, SNP 11 and SNP 19) were investigated. Six different haplotypic alleles were identified, but only four of them were frequent enough to allow for an evaluation of any haplotypic effect (at least six copies in the examined sample): Hap1, Hap2, Hap3 and Hap6. The analysis of associations between the selected haplotypes in the CD4 gene with milk related indexes showed that bulls with Hap2 (T-A-C-C) had better indexes for milk and protein yields (P < 0.05), whereas the presence of the Hap1 haplotype (A-G-A-T) caused a significant decrease of the index for protein yield (P < 0.05). Frequencies of the two alleles Hap1 and Hap2 (9 and 36% respectively) make them of interest for their possible inclusion in breeding schemes and support the hypothesis of considering this gene as a candidate for the improvement of milk-related traits in the Simmental breed.",0.0

The Hap1 transcription factor senses cellular heme status and increases expression of aerobic genes in response to oxygen. The repression of hypoxic genes under normoxic conditions results from Hap1-mediated activation of ROX1 transcription. To allow the identification of additional Hap1 and Rox1 target genes, genome-wide expression was analysed in aerobically, chemostat-cultivated hap1 and rox1 null mutants. The microarray results show that deletion of HAP1 causes a lower transcript level of 51 genes. Transcription of 40 genes was increased in rox1 mutant cells compared to wild-type cells. Combining these results with our previously described transcriptome data of aerobically and anaerobically grown cells and with computational analysis of the promoters identified 24 genes that are potentially regulated by Hap1, and 38 genes satisfied the criteria of being direct targets of Rox1.

Precise localization of transgenes and accurate artifact f iltration are essential for this type of method. To date, many mapping assays have been developed, including Inverse-PCR, TLA, LAM-PCR, and splinkerette PCR. However, none of them is able to ensure localization of both transgene's f lanking regions simultaneously, which would be necessary for some applications. Here we proposed a cheap and simple NGS-based approach that overcomes this limitation. The developed assay requires using intentionally designed vectors that lack recognition sites of one or a set of restriction enzymes used for DNA fragmentation. By looping and sequencing these DNA fragments, we obtain special data that allows us to link the two f lanking regions of the transposon. This can be useful for precise insertion mapping and for screening approaches in the f ield of chromosome engineering, where chromosomal recombination events between transgenes occur in a cell population. To demonstrate the method's feasibility, we applied it for mapping SB transposon integration in the human HAP1 cell line.

Expression of HEM13 is repressed by oxygen and heme. This study investigated the regulatory pathway responsible for the regulation of HEM13 expression. The transcriptional activator HAP1 is demonstrated to be required for the full-level expression of HEM13 in the absence of heme. It is also shown that the repression of HEM13 transcription caused by heme involves the HAP1 and ROX1 gene products; a mutation in either gene results in derepression of HEM13 expression. The heme-dependent expression of ROX1 was found to require functional HAP1, leading one to propose that repression of HEM13 results from a pathway involving HAP1-mediated regulation of ROX1 transcription in response to heme levels followed by ROX1-mediated repression of HEM13 transcription. In support of this model, expression of ROX1 under control of the GAL promoter was found to result in repression of HEM13 transcription in a hap1 mutant strain. The ability of ROX1 encoded by the galactose-inducible ROX1 construct to function in the absence of HAP1 indicates that the only role of HAP1 in repression of HEM13 is to activate ROX1 transcription.",0.0

Our data suggest that SIN3 is a dual function protein. It negatively regulates the transcriptional activities of hPR-A and hPR-B by affecting the N-terminal activation domain (AF1). SIN3 positively regulates the transcriptional activities of GAL4 and the HAP1 activator.

We have determined the cellular levels of this enzyme in 11 human tumour and fibroblast cell lines in relation to clonogenic survival following ionizing radiation. Cellular HAP1 levels and surviving fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) varied five- and tenfold respectively. However, no correlation was found between these two parameters following exposure to gamma-irradiation at low (1.1 cGy per min) or high (108 cGy per min) dose rates. To examine this further, wild-type and mutant versions of HAP1 were overexpressed, using an inducible HAP1 cDNA expression vector system, in the rat C6 glioma cell line which has low endogenous AP endonuclease activity. Induction of wild-type HAP1 expression caused a > fivefold increase in the capacity of cellular extracts to cleave an oligonucleotide substrate containing a single abasic site, but increased expression did not confer increased resistance to gamma-irradiation at high- or low-dose rates, or to the methylating agent methyl methanesulphonate (MMS). Expression in C6 cell lines of mutant forms of HAP1 deleted for either the redox activator or DNA repair functions displayed no apparent titrational or dominant negative effects.

In addition, the expression of AAC2 gene requires the products of the HAP2 and HAP3 genes, but not that of the HAP1 gene. The 5'-flanking region of the gene was isolated, sequenced and fused to the lacZ reporter gene in order to study the effect of carbon sources and of specific deletion mutations on expression of the gene in yeast transformants. The expression of the reporter gene reveals that the AAC2 gene possesses a strong inducible promoter. The promoter analysis, combined with expression studies in the wild-type as well as in various mutant strains, identified an upstream activation site (UAS) contained within a sequence between -393 bp and -268 bp, and several major initiation sites of AAC2 mRNA between -105bp and -95 bp. Deletion analysis also shows that the TATA boxes located 45 bp and 104 bp upstream of the 5'-ends of AAC2 mRNA are not essential for the transcription. The UAS of the AAC2 gene is required for activation by HAP2 and heme and for release from glucose repressin. A restriction fragment containing the UAS conferred oxygen and carbon source regulation when placed upstream of another yeast gene encoding ADP/ATP carrier (AAC3), deleted of its regulatory sequences.

The FXIII-A negative subgroup was significantly associated with the ""B-other"" genetic category and had an unfavorable disease outcome. Methods: RNA was extracted from bone marrow lymphoblasts of 42 pediatric patients with BCP-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). FXIII-A expression was determined by multiparameter FC. Genetic diagnosis was based on conventional cytogenetic method and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Affymetrix GeneChip Human Primeview array was used to analyze global expression pattern of 28,869 well-annotated genes. Microarray data were analyzed by Genespring GX14.9.1 software.

We concluded that: (i) CYP1 is an efficient activator especially in heme-depleted cells; (ii) CYP1 exerts both positive and negative regulatory effects; (iii) the nature of the regulatory function of CYP1 depends on the target gene; and (iv) for a given gene, the presence or absence of heme or oxygen reverses the sense of CYP1-dependent regulation.",0.0

The manner in which circadian clock genes regulate drought stress responses in model plants has been well established, but comparatively little is known in crop species, such as soybean, a major global crop. This paper reports that the core clock components GmLHYs, the orthologues of CCA1/LHY in Arabidopsis, negatively control drought tolerance in soybean. The expressions of four GmLHYs were all induced by drought, and the quadruple mutants of GmLHYs demonstrated significantly improved drought tolerance. Transcriptome profiling suggested that the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway is regulated by GmLHYs to respond to drought tolerance. Genetic dissections showed that two homologous pairs of LHY1a and LHY1b redundantly control the drought response. Functional characterization of LHY1a and LHY1b in Arabidopsis and soybean further supported the notion that GmLHYs can maintain cellular homeostasis through the ABA signaling pathway under drought stress. This study improves our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms on soybean drought tolerance. Furthermore, the two homologues of LHY1a and LHY1b provide alternative targets for genome editing to rapidly generate mutant alleles in elite soybean cultivars to enhance their drought tolerance.",0.0

However, the regulatory mechanisms by which TAMs influence the progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain unclear. Here, we report that hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) acts as a novel oncoprotein in TNBC. We found that HLF was regulated by transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) that is secreted by TAMs. Then, HLF transactivated gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1) to promote the ferroptosis resistance, thus driving TNBC cell proliferation, metastasis and cisplatin resistance. Reciprocally, IL-6 produced by TNBC cells activated the JAK2/STAT3 axis to induce TGF-β1 secretion by TAMs, thus constituted a feed-forward circuit. The accuracy of TNBC patient prognosis could be improved by employing a combination of HLF and GGT1 values. Thus, our findings document that the interactive dialogue between TNBC cells and TAMs promotes sustained activation of HLF in tumor cells through the IL-6-TGF-β1 axis. Subsequently, HLF promotes the ferroptosis resistance in TNBC cells via GGT1 and ultimately facilitates the malignant tumor progression.

Either its expression or its accumulation peaks in the morning and afternoon. WRKY2 and WRKY10 form heterodimers and recognize their target site in the PIF4 promoter near the MYB element that is bound by CCA1 and LHY under red and blue light. WRKY2 and WRKY10 interact directly with CCA1/LHY to enhance their targeting but interact indirectly with SHB1. The two WRKY proteins also interact with phyB, and their interaction enhances the targeting of CCA1 and LHY to the PIF4 promoter. SHB1 associates with the WRKY2 and WRKY10 loci and enhances their expression in parallel with the PIF4 expression peaks. This forward regulatory loop further sustains the accumulation of the two WRKY proteins and the targeting of CCA1/LHY to the PIF4 locus. In summary, interactions of two WRKY proteins with CCA1/LHY and phyB maintain an optimal expression level of PIF4 toward noon and afternoon, which is essential to sketch the circadian pattern of PIF4 expression.",0.0

Under light/dark cycles the lhy cca1-1 plants show dramatically earlier phases of expression of GI and TOC1, genes associated with the generation of circadian rhythms and the promotion of LHY and CCA1 expression.

Starch accumulation is increased when carbon is in short supply, for example, in short photoperiods. Mobilization is paced to exhaust starch around dawn, as anticipated by the circadian clock. This diel pattern of turnover is largely robust against loss of day, dawn, dusk, or evening clock components. Here, we investigated diel starch turnover in the triple circadian clock mutant lhy cca1 elf3, which lacks the LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL and the CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) dawn components and the EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3) evening components of the circadian clock. The diel oscillations of transcripts for the remaining clock components and related genes like REVEILLE and PHYTOCHROME-INTERACING FACTOR family members exhibited attenuated amplitudes and altered peak time, weakened dawn dominance, and decreased robustness against changes in the external light-dark cycle. The triple mutant was unable to increase starch accumulation in short photoperiods. However, it was still able to pace starch mobilization to around dawn in different photoperiods and growth irradiances and to around 24 h after the previous dawn in T17 and T28 cycles. The triple mutant was able to slow down starch mobilization after a sudden low-light day or a sudden early dusk, although in the latter case it did not fully compensate for the lengthened night. Overall, there was a slight trend to less linear mobilization of starch. Thus, starch mobilization can be paced rather robustly to dawn despite a major disruption of the transcriptional clock.

In this study, we identified a vernalization-responsive cis-element in the VIN3 promoter, VREVIN3, composed of a G-box and an evening element (EE). Mutations in either the G-box or the EE prevented VIN3 expression from being fully induced upon vernalization, leading to defects in the vernalization response. We determined that the core clock proteins CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and LATE-ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) associate with the EE of VREVIN3, both in vitro and in vivo. In a cca1 lhy double mutant background harboring a functional FRIGIDA allele, long-term cold-mediated VIN3 induction and acceleration of flowering were impaired, especially under mild cold conditions such as at 12°C. During prolonged cold exposure, oscillations of CCA1/LHY transcripts were altered, while CCA1 abundance increased at dusk, coinciding with the diurnal peak of VIN3 transcripts.

However, additive effects of the lhy-1 and det1-1 mutations on CAB2 expression patterns were revealed under diurnal light-dark cycles. Since the lhy-1 mutation causes aberrant, constitutive transcription of LHY from a constitutive viral promoter, this observation indicated that effects of DET1 were not mediated through the regulation of LHY transcription. Furthermore, the light-driven, rhythmic accumulation of the LHY protein in the lhy-1 mutant was altered by the det1-1 mutation, suggesting that DET1 might regulate LHY expression at the post-transcriptional level. In vitro protein degradation assays demonstrated that the LHY protein is turned over rapidly through the proteasome pathway. Similar degradation was observed whether plant tissue was harvested during the light or dark portion of the diurnal cycle, but the process was significantly accelerated in det1-1 mutant extracts.

We have used this assay with wild-type and mutant seedlings to examine the role of these oscillator components, and to determine the function of ELF3 and ELF4 in their light-regulated expression. The data show that whereas TOC1 is necessary for light-induced CCA1/LHY expression, the combined absence of CCA1 and LHY has little effect on the pattern of light-induced TOC1 expression, indicating that the negative regulatory arm of the proposed oscillator is not fully functional during initial seedling de-etiolation. By contrast, ELF4 is necessary for light-induced expression of both CCA1 and LHY, and conversely, CCA1 and LHY act negatively on light-induced ELF4 expression. Together with the observation that the temporal light-induced expression profile of ELF4 is counter-phased to that of CCA1 and LHY and parallels that of TOC1, these data are consistent with a previously unrecognized negative-feedback loop formed by CCA1/LHY and ELF4 in a manner analogous to the proposed CCA1/LHY/TOC1 oscillator. ELF3 is also necessary for light-induced CCA1/LHY expression, but it is neither light-induced nor clock-regulated during de-etiolation.

This confirms that the system and its collective behavior are initially dominated by LHY interactions. Moreover, the monopole oscillation frequency is found to be stable against variations of the involved scattering lengths in a broad region around the ideal values, confirming the stabilizing effect of the LHY interaction.

Previous work showed that temperature changes affected the splicing of several circadian clock gene transcripts. Here, we investigated the role of RNA-binding splicing factors (SFs) in temperature-sensitive AS of the clock gene LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY). We characterized, in wild type plants, temperature-associated isoform switching and expression patterns for SF transcripts from a high-resolution temperature and time series RNA-seq experiment. In addition, we employed quantitative RT-PCR of SF mutant plants to explore the role of the SFs in cooling-associated AS of LHY. We show that the splicing and expression of several SFs responds sufficiently, rapidly, and sensitively to temperature changes to contribute to the splicing of the 5'UTR of LHY. Moreover, the choice of splice site in LHY was altered in some SF mutants. The splicing of the 5'UTR region of LHY has characteristics of a molecular thermostat, where the ratio of transcript isoforms is sensitive to temperature changes as modest as 2 °C and is scalable over a wide dynamic range of temperature. Our work provides novel insight into SF-mediated coupling of the perception of temperature to post-transcriptional regulation of the clock.",0.0

LHY and CCA1 accelerated flowering in LL by promoting FT expression through a genetic pathway that appears to be independent of the canonical photoperiodic pathway involving GI and CO proteins.

We performed m6A sequencing techniques and constructed FTO-knockdown/FTO-overexpressing cells to investigate the role of FTO-mediated m6A modification in regulating apoptosis following CoCl2 induced oxidative stress. Our study has shown CoCl2 exposure led to the decrease of demethylase FTO as well as elevated oxidative stress.

Meanwhile, MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq further revealed the potential function m6A modification in regulating apoptosis. More importantly, KEGG pathway and Gene ontology (GO) analyses further elucidated that the differentially m6A-modified genes were aggregated in apoptosis-related pathways. Mechanistic analysis indicated that knockdown of FTO facilitated CoCl2-induced apoptosis via caspase activation and G1/S cell cycle arrest. Nevertheless, overexpression of FTO partly attenuated the increased apoptosis following CoCl2 exposure. More notably, we observed that FTO regulated apoptosis in an m6A-dependent manner. Therefore, our findings reveal that CoCl2 induced ROS affected the m6A modification of apoptosis-related genes by decreasing the expression of FTO, thereby resulting in the activation of apoptosis.

Functional studies reveal that MUC15 inhibits hepatoma cells self-renewal, malignant proliferation, tumorigenicity, and chemoresistance. Mechanistically, MUC15 interacts with c-MET and subsequently inactivates the PI3K/AKT/SOX2 signaling pathway. Moreover, we find that miR-183-5p.1 directly targets MUC15 3'-UTR in liver T-ICs.

PpCCA1a and PpCCA1b, together with angiosperm CCA1/LHY homologs, belong to the clock-associated single-myb gene family of green plants (including green algae and land plants). The accumulation of PpCCA1a and PpCCA1b mRNA showed rhythms with a period of approximately 1 day, phased as are those of angiosperm homologs, under 24 h light/dark cycles or in continuous dark. However, in marked contrast to angiosperm homologs, both genes showed arrhythmic profiles in continuous light. The timing of the PpCCA1b peak is determined by the time of the last light to dark transition, suggesting that the arrhythmicity in continuous light is due to dysfunction of the core clock. We generated single and double disruptants for PpCCA1a and PpCCA1b, and found that the double disruptants showed: (i) short periodicity and damped amplitude in the PpCCA1b rhythm, (ii) similar changes in the rhythmically expressed genes PpSIG5 and PpPRRa, and (iii) de-repression of PpCCA1b transcription levels, indicating negative feedback regulation.

Under different light regimes, Lhcb and PvLHY exhibit a clear circadian pattern of expression. Moreover, the rhythm of Lhcb genes appears to be tightly coupled to that of PvLHY with the latter having a slightly earlier phase. This supports the idea that the oscillating capacity of PvLHY may be one of the causes of the rhythmic expression of Lhcb genes in bean. In addition to their circadian regulation, Lhcb and PvLHY are induced by light with similar and relatively slow induction kinetics. Moreover, this light induction is gated by the circadian oscillator: minimal responses occur at times around peaks of the pre-existing rhythm, while maximal ones occur at troughs of the pre-existing rhythm. This pattern of gating is opposite to that observed in Arabidopsis. The failure to block the light induction pathways at pre-existing troughs appears to have a detrimental effect to the subsequent circadian rhythmicity.

Single mutants of cca1 and lhy have a phenotype of short-period rhythms. cca1 lhy double mutants show an even shorter period phenotype than the cca1 single mutant, suggesting that CCA1 and LHY are only partially functionally redundant. To determine whether CCA1 and LHY act in parallel or synergistically in the circadian clock, we examined their expression in both light-grown and etiolated seedlings. We have shown that LHY and CCA1 bind to the same region of the promoter of a Light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein (Lhcb, also known as CAB). CCA1 and LHY can form homodimers, and they also colocalize in the nucleus and heterodimerize in vitro and in vivo. In Arabidopsis, CCA1 and LHY physically interact in a manner independent of photoperiod.

The results showed that walnut seedlings under nitrogen starvation and excess stress could adapt to the changes in the nitrogen environment by changing the coordination of their root morphology and physiological indexes. Based on an analysis of transcriptome data, 4911 differential genes (DEGs) were obtained (2180 were upregulated and 2731 were downregulated) in a comparison of nitrogen starvation and control groups. A total of 9497 DEGs (5091 upregulated and 4406 downregulated) were obtained in the comparison between the nitrogen overdose and control groups. When these DEGs were analysed, the differential genes in both groups were found to be significantly enriched in the plant's circadian pathway. Therefore, we selected the circadian rhythm as the focus for further analysis. We made some discoveries by analysing the gene co-expression network of nitrogen metabolism, circadian rhythm, and hormone signal transduction.

To reveal the underlying mechanisms of SI in dragon fruit, plant anatomy, de novo RNA sequencing-based transcriptomic analysis, and multiple bioinformatic approaches were used to analyze gene expression in the pistils of the self-pollinated and cross-pollinated dragon fruit flowers at different intervals of time after pollination. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observed that the pollen of 'Hongshuijing', a self-incompatible dragon fruit variety (S. monacanthus), germinated on its own stigma.

Additionally, 13 transcription factors (TFs) (YABBY4, ANL2, ERF43, ARF2, BLH7, KNAT6, PIF3, two OBF1, two HY5 and two LHY/CCA) were identified to be involved in dragon fruit GSI. Thus, we uncovered candidate S and non-S genes and predicted more SI-related genes for a more detailed investigation of the molecular mechanism of dragon fruit SI. Our findings suggest that dragon fruit possesses a GSI system and involves some unique regulators. This study lays the groundwork for future research into SI mechanisms in dragon fruit and other plant species.",0.0

For defensive measures to be timely and successful, a high arousal state and immediate sleep-to-wakefulness transition are required. Recently, the glutamatergic basal forebrain (BF) has been implicated in sleep-wake regulation; however, the associated physiological functions and underlying neural circuits remain unknown. Here, using in vivo fiber photometry, we found that BF glutamatergic neuron is activated by various threatening stimuli, including predator odor, looming threat, sound, and tail suspension. Optogenetic activation of BF glutamatergic neurons induced a series of context-dependent defensive behaviors in mice, including escape, fleeing, avoidance, and hiding. Similar to the effects of activated BF glutamatergic cell body, photoactivation of BF glutamatergic terminals in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) strongly drove defensive behaviors in mice. Using synchronous electroencephalogram (EEG)/electromyogram (EMG) recording, we showed that photoactivation of the glutamatergic BF-VTA pathway produced an immediate transition from sleep to wakefulness and significantly increased wakefulness. Collectively, our results clearly demonstrated that the glutamatergic BF is a key neural substrate involved in wakefulness and defensive behaviors, and encodes these behaviors through glutamatergic BF-VTA pathway. Overexcitation of the glutamatergic BF-VTA pathway may be implicated in clinical psychiatric diseases characterized by exaggerated defensive responses, such as autism spectrum disorders.",0.0

We found that forests in 10 plots showed a significant change in Sx consistently around 1980. The growth of slope forest was significantly correlated with increases in temperature and precipitation, while the wetland forests, including bogs and peatland plateaus, responded negatively to temperature. In terms of precipitation, there was no effect in the peatland plateaus, but a negative effect occurred in bogs.

To gain more insight into the hormonal control of isoprene biosynthesis, the present study measured plant hormone concentrations in jasmonic acid (JA)-treated leaves of our previous model study, examined their relationship with gene expression of isoprene synthase (IspS) and hormone signalling transcription factors. Of the plant hormones, IAA and JA-Ile and their related transcription factors (MYC2 and SAUR21) were significantly correlated with IspS gene expression. Concentrations of cytokinins, isopentenyladenine (iP), trans-zeatin riboside (tZR) and cis-zeatin riboside (cZR), were similarly significantly correlated with IspS expression. However, there was no significant correlation between their related transcription factor (ARR-B) and IspS expression. The circadian clock-related gene PRR7, but not the transcription factor LHY, was highly correlated with IspS expression. These results suggest that the hormonal balance between JA-Ile and IAA plays a central role in transcriptional regulation of IspS through the transcription factors MYC2 and SAUR21, the early auxin responsive genes. The putative cis-acting elements for SAUR on the IspS promoter (TGTCNN and CATATG), in addition to the G-box for MYC2, support the above proposal.

However, PERI has been rarely demonstrated for well established species drawn from different genera. In particular, parallel molecular signatures for the same genes in response to similar habitat divergence in such different lineages is lacking. Here, based on whole-genome sequencing data, we first explore the speciation process in two sister species of Carpinus (Betulaceae) in response to divergence for temperature and soil-iron concentration in habitats they occupy in northern and southwestern China, respectively. We then determine whether parallel molecular mutations occur during speciation in this pair of species and also in another sister-species pair of the related genus, Ostryopsis, which occupy similarly divergent habitats in China. We show that gene flow occurred during the origin of both pairs of sister species since approximately 9.8 or approximately 2 million years ago, implying strong natural selection during divergence. Also, in both species pairs we detected concurrent positive selection in a gene (LHY) for flowering time and in two paralogous genes (FRO4 and FRO7) of a gene family known to be important for iron tolerance. These changes were in addition to changes in other major genes related to these two traits. The different alleles of these particular candidate genes possessed by the sister species of Carpinus were functionally tested and indicated likely to alter flowering time and iron tolerance as previously demonstrated in the pair of Ostryopsis sister species. Allelic changes in these genes may have effectively resulted in high levels of prezygotic reproductive isolation to evolve between sister species of each pair. Our results show that PERI can occur in different genera at different timescales and involve similar signatures of molecular evolution at genes or paralogues of the same gene family, causing reproductive isolation as a consequence of adaptation to similarly divergent habitats.",0.0

Genome-wide comparative analyses of 118 chickens living in different latitudes showed 46 genes and several pathways that may be involved in cold adaptation. The results of the functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes proved the important role of metabolic pathways and immune-related pathways in cold tolerance in chickens.

Recently, the circadian clock has been shown to affect plant responses to biotic cues. To further examine this role of the circadian clock, we tested disease resistance in mutants disrupted in CCA1 and LHY, which act synergistically to regulate clock activity. We found that cca1 and lhy mutants also synergistically affect basal and resistance gene-mediated defense against Pseudomonas syringae and Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. Disrupting the circadian clock caused by overexpression of CCA1 or LHY also resulted in severe susceptibility to P. syringae. We identified a downstream target of CCA1 and LHY, GRP7, a key constituent of a slave oscillator regulated by the circadian clock and previously shown to influence plant defense and stomatal activity. We show that the defense role of CCA1 and LHY against P. syringae is at least partially through circadian control of stomatal aperture but is independent of defense mediated by salicylic acid. Furthermore, we found defense activation by P. syringae infection and treatment with the elicitor flg22 can feedback-regulate clock activity. Together this data strongly supports a direct role of the circadian clock in defense control and reveal for the first time crosstalk between the circadian clock and plant innate immunity.",0.0

The LHY/CCA1-PRR5/9, RVE4/8-PRR3/7, and PIF3-PHYA genetic linkages emerged in the bryophyte lineage and progressively moved within several genes of each other across an array of angiosperm families representing distinct whole-genome duplication and fractionation events. Soybean (Glycine max) maintained all but two genetic linkages, and expression analysis revealed the PIF3-PHYA linkage overlapping with the E4 maturity group locus was the only pair to robustly cycle with an evening phase, in contrast to the sMYB-PRR morning and midday phase. While most monocots maintain the genetic linkages, they have been lost in the economically important grasses (Poaceae), such as maize (Zea mays), where the genes have been fractionated to separate chromosomes and presence/absence variation results in the segregation of PRR7 paralogs across heterotic groups. The environmental robustness model is put forward, suggesting that evolutionarily conserved genetic linkages ensure superior microhabitat pollinator synchrony, while wide-hybrids or unlinking the genes, as seen in the grasses, result in heterosis, adaptation, and colonization of new ecological niches.",0.0

DNA ligases I, III and IV each function in the nucleus whereas DNA ligase III is the sole enzyme in mitochondria. While the identification of specific protein partners and the phenotypes caused either by genetic or chemical inactivation have provided insights into the cellular functions of the DNA ligases and evidence for significant functional overlap in nuclear DNA replication and repair, different results have been obtained with mouse and human cells, indicating species-specific differences in the relative contributions of the DNA ligases. Inherited mutations in the human LIG1 and LIG4 genes that result in the generation of polypeptides with partial activity have been identified as the causative factors in rare DNA ligase deficiency syndromes that share a common clinical symptom, immunodeficiency. In the case of DNA ligase IV, the immunodeficiency is due to a defect in V(D)J recombination whereas the cause of the immunodeficiency due to DNA ligase I deficiency is not known. Overexpression of each of the DNA ligases has been observed in cancers. For DNA ligase I, this reflects increased proliferation. Elevated levels of DNA ligase III indicate an increased dependence on an alternative non-homologous end-joining pathway for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks whereas elevated level of DNA ligase IV confer radioresistance due to increased repair of DNA double-strand breaks by the major non-homologous end-joining pathway.

An in silico analysis was performed to evaluate the association between the expression of SRSF1 and DNA repair genes.

408,Genes ,PUBMED: 26110316; ,"Higher eukaryotes have three types of DNA ligases: DNA ligase 1 (Lig1), DNA ligase 3 (Lig3) and DNA ligase 4 (Lig4). While Lig1 and Lig4 are present in all eukaryotes from yeast to human, Lig3 appears sporadically in evolution and is uniformly present only in vertebrates. In the classical, textbook view, Lig1 catalyzes Okazaki-fragment ligation at the DNA replication fork and the ligation steps of long-patch base-excision repair (BER), homologous recombination repair (HRR) and nucleotide excision repair (NER). Lig4 is responsible for DNA ligation at DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by the classical, DNA-PKcs-dependent pathway of non-homologous end joining (C-NHEJ). Lig3 is implicated in a short-patch base excision repair (BER) pathway, in single strand break repair in the nucleus, and in all ligation requirements of the DNA metabolism in mitochondria. In this scenario, Lig1 and Lig4 feature as the major DNA ligases serving the most essential ligation needs of the cell, while Lig3 serves in the cell nucleus only minor repair roles. Notably, recent systematic studies in the chicken B cell line, DT40, involving constitutive and conditional knockouts of all three DNA ligases individually, as well as of combinations thereof, demonstrate that the current view must be revised. Results demonstrate that Lig1 deficient cells proliferate efficiently. Even Lig1/Lig4 double knockout cells show long-term viability and proliferate actively, demonstrating that, at least in DT40, Lig3 can perform all ligation reactions of the cellular DNA metabolism as sole DNA ligase. Indeed, in the absence of Lig1, Lig3 can efficiently support semi-conservative DNA replication via an alternative Okazaki-fragment ligation pathway. In addition, Lig3 can back up NHEJ in the absence of Lig4, and can support NER and HRR in the absence of Lig1. Supporting observations are available in less elaborate genetic models in mouse cells. Collectively, these observations raise Lig3 from a niche-ligase to a universal DNA ligase, which can potentially substitute or backup the repair and replication functions of all other DNA ligases in the cell nucleus. Thus, the old model of functionally dedicated DNA ligases is now replaced by one in which only Lig4 remains dedicated to C-NHEJ, with Lig1 and Lig3 showing an astounding functional flexibility and interchangeability for practically all nuclear ligation functions. The underlying mechanisms of Lig3 versus Lig1 utilization in DNA repair and replication are expected to be partly different and remain to be elucidated.",0.0

DNA vectors expressing maize codon-optimized Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 endonuclease and single guide RNAs were cointroduced with or without DNA repair templates into maize immature embryos by biolistic transformation targeting five different genomic regions: upstream of the liguleless1 (LIG1) gene, male fertility genes (Ms26 and Ms45), and acetolactate synthase (ALS) genes (ALS1 and ALS2). Mutations were subsequently identified at all sites targeted, and plants containing biallelic multiplex mutations at LIG1, Ms26, and Ms45 were recovered. Biolistic delivery of guide RNAs (as RNA molecules) directly into immature embryo cells containing preintegrated Cas9 also resulted in targeted mutations. Editing the ALS2 gene using either single-stranded oligonucleotides or double-stranded DNA vectors as repair templates yielded chlorsulfuron-resistant plants. Double-strand breaks generated by RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease also stimulated insertion of a trait gene at a site near LIG1 by homology-directed repair. Progeny showed expected Mendelian segregation of mutations, edits, and targeted gene insertions. The examples reported in this study demonstrate the utility of Cas9-guide RNA technology as a plant genome editing tool to enhance plant breeding and crop research needed to meet growing agriculture demands of the future.",0.0

Three mammalian genes encoding DNA ligases, LIG1, LIG3 and LIG4, have been identified. Since DNA ligase II appears to be derived from DNA ligase III by a proteolytic mechanism, the three LIG genes can account for the four biochemically distinct DNA ligase activities, DNA ligases I, II, III and IV, that have been purified from mammalian cell extracts. It is probable that the specific cellular roles of these enzymes are determined by the proteins with which they interact. The specific involvement of DNA ligase I in DNA replication is mediated by the non-catalytic amino-terminal domain of this enzyme. Furthermore, DNA ligase I participates in DNA base excision repair as a component of a multiprotein complex. Two forms of DNA ligase III are produced by an alternative splicing mechanism. The ubiqitously expressed DNA ligase III-alpha forms a complex with the DNA single-strand break repair protein XRCC1. In contrast, DNA ligase III-beta, which does not interact with XRCC1, is only expressed in male meiotic germ cells, suggesting a role for this isoform in meiotic recombination. At present, there is very little information about the cellular functions of DNA ligase IV.",0.0

Five DNA ligase activities, I-V, have been purified from mammalian cell extracts and three mammalian LIG genes, LIG1 LIG3 and LIG4, have been cloned. During DNA replication, the joining of Okazaki fragments by the LIG1 gene product appears to be mediated by an interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). This interaction may also occur during the completion of mismatch, nucleotide excision and base excision repair (BER). In addition, DNA ligase I participates in a second BER pathway that is carried out by a multiprotein complex in which DNA ligase I interacts directly with DNA polymerase beta. DNA ligase III alpha and DNA ligase III beta, which are generated by alternative splicing of the LIG3 gene, can be distinguished by their ability to bind to the DNA repair protein, XRCC1. The interaction between DNA ligase III alpha and XRCC1, which occurs through BRCT motifs in the C-termini of these polypeptides, implicates this isoform of DNA ligase III in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks and BER. DNA ligase II appears to be a proteolytic fragment of DNA ligase III alpha. The restricted expression of DNA ligase III beta suggests that this enzyme may function in the completion of meiotic recombination or in a postmeiosis DNA repair pathway. Complex formation between DNA ligase IV and the DNA repair protein XRCC4 involves the C-terminal region of DNA ligase IV, which contains two BRCT motifs. This interaction, which stimulates DNA joining activity, implies that DNA ligase IV functions in V(D)J recombination and non-homologous end-joining of DNA double-strand breaks. At the present time, it is not known whether DNA ligase V is derived from one of the known mammalian LIG genes or is the product of a novel gene.",0.0

The tandem Tudor domain (TTD) of UHRF1 binds histone H3K9me2/3 with micromolar affinity, as well as unmethylated linker regions within UHRF1 itself, causing auto-inhibition. Recently, we showed that a methylated histone-like region of DNA ligase 1 (LIG1K126me2/me3) binds the UHRF1 TTD with nanomolar affinity, permitting UHRF1 recruitment to chromatin. Here we report the crystal structure of the UHRF1 TTD bound to a LIG1K126me3 peptide. The data explain the basis for the high TTD-binding affinity of LIG1K126me3 and reveal that the interaction may be regulated by phosphorylation.

The first finding was that intron 6 is approximately 2.6 kb in size, not the 1 kb reported in the literature. By sequence analysis of amplified segments, the single-base difference in exon 6 was shown to be polymorphic, with HeLa cells heterozygous for the A/C difference. Analysis of 60 unrelated individuals found a frequency of 0.5 for each allele. Primer extension reactions across the exon 5/exon 6 boundary were performed on cDNA obtained from HeLa cells and human thymus. The results show that the three-base deletion is due to a variation in splicing. For both HeLa and thymus, two-thirds of the transcripts are like the published cDNA sequence and one-third have the three-base deletion. Finally, sequencing of part of intron 6 revealed the presence of a complex GT repeat consisting of a 48-50 nucleotide polypurine tract followed by a variable number of GT residues. This entire unit of polypurine tract plus GTs is repeated three times. Detection of the repeated sequences required the development of specialized cloning and PCR conditions.

Whether LIG1, LIG3 and LIG4 can influence ovarian cancer pathogenesis and therapeutics is largely unknown. Methods: We investigated LIG1, LIG3 and LIG4 expression in clinical cohorts of epithelial ovarian cancers [protein level (n=525) and transcriptional level (n=1075)] and correlated to clinicopathological features and survival outcomes. Pre-clinically, platinum sensitivity was investigated in LIG1 depleted ovarian cancer cells. A small molecule inhibitor of LIG1 (L82) was tested for synthetic lethality application in XRCC1, BRCA2 or ATM deficient cancer cells. Results: LIG1 and LIG3 overexpression linked with aggressive phenotypes, platinum resistance and poor progression free survival (PFS). In contrast, LIG4 deficiency was associated with platinum resistance and worse PFS. In a multivariate analysis, LIG1 was independently associated with adverse outcome. In ovarian cancer cell lines, LIG1 depletion increased platinum cytotoxicity. L82 monotherapy was synthetically lethal in XRCC1 deficient ovarian cancer cells and 3D-spheroids. Increased cytotoxicity was linked with accumulation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), S-phase cell cycle arrest and increased apoptotic cells. L82 was also selectively toxic in BRCA2 deficient or ATM deficient cancer cells and 3D-spheroids.

These findings demonstrate that Lig1 is not absolutely required for cellular DNA replication and repair and that either Lig3 or Lig4 can substitute for the role of Lig1 in joining Okazaki fragments.

We used an assay that monitors repair of damaged bases and abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic, AP) sites in Arabidopsis to characterize post-excision events during plant BER. We found that Apurinic endonuclease-redox protein (ARP) is the major AP endonuclease activity in Arabidopsis cell extracts, and is required for AP incision during uracil BER in vitro. Mutant plants that are deficient in ARP grow normally but are hypersensitive to 5-fluorouracil, a compound that favours mis-incorporation of uracil into DNA. We also found that, after AP incision, the choice between single-nucleotide or long-patch DNA synthesis (SN- or LP-BER) is influenced by the 5' end of the repair gap. When the 5' end is blocked and not amenable to β-elimination, the SN sub-pathway is abrogated, and repair is accomplished through LP-BER only. Finally, we provide evidence that Arabidopsis DNA ligase I (LIG1) is required for both SN- and LP-BER. lig1 RNAi-silenced lines show very reduced uracil BER, and anti-LIG1 antibody abolishes repair in wild-type cell extracts. In contrast, knockout lig4(-/-) mutants exhibit normal BER and nick ligation levels.

However, recently accumulated evidence on LRIG protein expression in human cancer appears to be inconsistent with this belief, as LRIG proteins have been found to be upregulated in certain tumors. Moreover, LRIG3 has been shown to act in an opposite manner to LRIG1 and LRIG1, in turn, has been shown to attenuate LRIG3 activity by its proteolytic degradation. These remarkable observations underline and reveal the previously unappreciated complexity of LRIG family dynamics. In the current review, the role of LRIG proteins in various human cancers is summarized and their differential regulation and expression is brought to light in order to understand how these proteins are involved in the genesis and progression of human cancers. Moreover, this is the first compilation that highlights the therapeutic potential of LRIG1 and suggests the same to be undertaken for LRIG2 and LRIG3.

We evaluated potential gene-gene and gene-environment interactions using a multianalytic strategy combining logistic regression, multifactor dimensionality reduction and classification and regression tree approaches.

The first step in V(D)J recombination is cleavage of DNA at recombination signal sequences. Cleavage produces a blunt DNA end on each signal sequence and a hairpin end on adjacent coding gene segments, and can be reproduced in vitro by using purified RAG and RAG2 proteins. The later steps involve processing and joining of the cleaved DNA ends, and until now have been studied only in cells. Here we reconstitute the complete V(D)J recombination reaction in a cell-free system. We find that the RAG proteins are not only involved in cleavage, but are also needed in the later steps for efficient joining of coding ends. Joining is largely directed by short pieces of identical sequence in the coding flanks, but addition of human DNA ligase I results in greater diversity. Coding junctions contain short deletions as well as additions complementary to a coding flank (P nucleotides). Addition of non-templated nucleotides into coding junctions is mediated by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase.

Our knowledge on the plant enzyme is limited to the activity of the Arabidopsis recombinant protein MBD4L in vitro. To start evaluating MBD4L in its biological context, we here characterized the structure, expression and effects of its gene, AtMBD4L. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that AtMBD4L belongs to one of the seven families of HhH-GPD DNA glycosylase genes existing in plants, and is unique on its family. Two AtMBD4L transcripts coding for active enzymes were detected in leaves and flowers. Transgenic plants expressing the AtMBD4L:GUS gene confined GUS activity to perivascular leaf tissues (usually adjacent to hydathodes), flowers (anthers at particular stages of development), and the apex of immature siliques. MBD4L-GFP fusion proteins showed nuclear localization in planta.

The LIG3 gene encodes a ubiquitous isoform in all tissues (LIG3α) and a germ line-specific splicing isoform (LIG3β) that differs in the C-terminal domain. Both isoforms are found in the nucleus and the mitochondria. Here, we determined the kinetics and thermodynamics of single-stranded break ligation by LIG3α and LIG3β and compared this framework to that of LIG1, the nuclear replicative ligase. The kinetic parameters of the LIG3 isoforms are nearly identical under all tested conditions, indicating that the BRCA1 C terminal (BRCT) domain specific to LIG3α does not alter ligation kinetics. Although LIG3 is only 22% identical to LIG1 across their conserved domains, the two enzymes had very similar maximal ligation rates. Comparison of the rate and equilibrium constants for LIG3 and LIG1 nevertheless revealed important differences. The LIG3 isoforms were seven times more efficient than LIG1 at ligating nicked DNA under optimal conditions, mainly because of their lower Km value for the DNA substrate. This could explain why LIG3 is less prone to abortive ligation than LIG1. Surprisingly, the affinity of LIG3 for Mg2+ was ten times weaker than that of LIG1, suggesting that Mg2+ availability regulates DNA ligation in vivo, because Mg2+ levels are higher in the mitochondria than in the nucleus. The biochemical differences between the LIG3 isoforms and LIG1 identified here will guide the understanding of both unique and overlapping biological roles of these critical enzymes.",0.0
439,Progress in nucleic acid research and molecular biology ,PUBMED: 11554294; ,"Three mammalian genes encoding DNA ligases--LIG1, LIG3, and LIG4--have been identified. Genetic, biochemical, and cell biology studies indicate that the products of each of these genes play a unique role in mammalian DNA metabolism. Interestingly, cell lines deficient in either DNA ligase I (46BR.1G1) or DNA ligase III (EM9) are sensitive to simple alkylating agents. One interpretation of these observations is that DNA ligases I and III participate in functionally distinct base excision repair (BER) subpathways. In support of this idea, extracts from both DNA ligase-deficient cell lines are defective in catalyzing BER in vitro and both DNA ligases interact with other BER proteins. DNA ligase I interacts directly with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and DNA polymerase beta (Pol beta), linking this enzyme with both short-patch and long-patch BER. In somatic cells, DNA ligase III alpha forms a stable complex with the DNA repair protein Xrcc1. Although Xrcc1 has no catalytic activity, it also interacts with Pol beta and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), linking DNA ligase III alpha with BER and single-strand break repair, respectively. Biochemical studies suggest that the majority of short-patch base excision repair events are completed by the DNA ligase III alpha/Xrcc1 complex. Although there is compelling evidence for the participation of PARP in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks, the role of PARP in BER has not been established.",0.0

In some types of advanced tumors that are rapidly dividing, gene expression profiles depict elevations in pro-proliferative genes accompanied by coordinately elevated transcription of factors responsible for removal of DNA lesions. In our studies, fast proliferating breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF7), BRG1, a component of the SWI/SNF complex, emerges as an activator of functionally-linked genes responsible for activities such as mitotic cell divisions and DNA repair. Products of at least some of them are considerably overrepresented in breast cancer cells and BRG1 facilitates growth of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. BRG1 occurs at the promoters of genes such as CDK4, LIG1, and NEIL3, which are transcriptionally controlled by cell cycle progression and highly acetylated by EP300 in proliferating cells. As previously documented, in dividing cells BRG1 directly activates gene transcription by evicting EP300 modified nucleosomes from the promoters and, thereby, relaxing chromatin. However, the deficiency of BRG1 or EP300 activity for 48 h leads to cell growth arrest and to chromatin compaction, but also to the assembly of RB1/HDAC1/EZH2 complexes at the studied cell cycle-dependent gene promoters. Epigenetic changes include histone deacetylation and accumulation of H3K27me trimethylation, both known to repress transcription. Cell cycle arrest in G1 by inhibition of CDK4/6 phenocopies the effect of the long-term BRG1 inhibition on the chromatin structure. These results suggest that BRG1 may control gene transcription also by promoting expression of genes responsible for cell cycle progression in the studied breast cancer cells. In the current study, we show that BRG1 binding occurs at the promoters of functionally linked genes in proliferating breast cancer cells, revealing a new mechanism by which BRG1 defines gene transcription.",0.0

To characterize this karyotypic complexity at the molecular level, we used cDNA array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to analyze 29 CC cases and identified a number of over represented and deleted genes. The aCGH analysis revealed at least 17 recurrent amplicons and six common regions of deletions. These regions contain several known tumor-associated genes, such as those involved in transcription, apoptosis, cytoskeletal remodeling, ion-transport, drug metabolism, and immune response. Using the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) approach we demonstrated the presence of high-level amplifications at the 8q24.3, 11q22.2, and 20q13 regions in CC cell lines. To identify amplification-associated genes that correspond to focal amplicons, we examined one or more genes in each of the 17 amplicons by Affymetrix U133A expression arrays and semiquantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) in 31 CC tumors. This analysis exhibited frequent and robust upregulated expression in CC relative to normal cervix for genes EPHB2 (1p36), CDCA8 (1p34.3), AIM2 (1q22-23), RFC4, MUC4, and HRASLS (3q27-29), SKP2 (5p12-13), CENTD3 (5q31.3), PTK2, RECQL4 (8q24), MMP1 and MMP13 (11q22.2), AKT1 (14q32.3), ABCC3 (17q21-22), SMARCA4 (19p13.3) LIG1 (19q13.3), UBE2C (20q13.1), SMC1L1 (Xp11), KIF4A (Xq12), TMSNB (Xq22), and CSAG2 (Xq28).

Our initial deletion mapping of this gene localized the common region of deletion to the distal long arm, 19q13.2-13.4. To bracket the putative tumor suppressor gene further, we have studied this region in 55 gliomas, using loss of heterozygosity studies for 11 well mapped, highly informative microsatellite polymorphisms that cover this area: D19S178; BCL3; APOC2; ERCC1; DM; D19S112; HRC; D19S246; KLK; D19S180; and D19S254 (from centromeric to telomeric). Twenty astrocytic, oligodendroglial, and mixed gliomas had deletions affecting this region. Of nine partial deletions, two cases maintained heterozygosity at APOC2 while showing allelic loss at the more telomeric markers, ERCC1 and DM, while five cases maintained heterozygosity at HRC but lost the more centromeric markers, D19S112 and DM. Nine cases lost the entire D19S178 to D19S254 region. Three astrocytic gliomas, including one with an interstitial deletion, had terminal deletions of 19q13.4. The minimum area of overlap shared by the interstitial deletions is between APOC2 and HRC, including ERCC1, DM, and D19S112. These findings suggest that the glioma tumor suppressor gene maps to an approximately 8-cM/5-megabase region on 19q13.2-13.3 between the proximal marker APOC2 and the distal marker HRC. Among the DNA repair/DNA metabolism genes on chromosome 19q, ERCC1, LIG1, and perhaps ERCC2 are within the common area of deletion; XRCC1 is centromeric and is therefore excluded as a candidate.",0.0

An APE-1 overexpression vector was similarly constructed and verified as correct. The STRING website predicted the protein-protein interaction network of APE-1. ELISA was used to detect the effects of APE-1 silencing and overexpression on inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-10, TNFα, and INF-γ in the control group, APE-1-silenced group, and APE-1 overexpression group. Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis in each group. Forty differentially expressed genes related to immune tolerance after liver transplantation were screened, and the highly expressed gene APE-1 was selected.

Cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, cDNA microarray, gene and protein expression, and NSCLC transplanted tumour growth were performed. Berberine suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro and inhibited NSCLC tumour growth in subcutaneously transplanted tumour lung tumour models, leading to prolonged survival of tumour-bearing mice.

Here, we determined the mRNA levels of BER pathway-related genes (ogg1, nthl1, apex1, parp1, xrcc1, lig3, ung, pcna, polb, pold, fen1, and lig1), pro-apoptotic gene (bax), and apoptotic suppressor gene (bcl2) in different PAEs-exposed zebrafish larvae and HEK293T cells. Further investigations were performed to examine reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, developmental toxicity, and cell viability after PAEs exposure in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that PAEs exposure can induce developmental abnormalities in zebrafish larvae, and inhibit cell viability in HEK293T cells. Additionally, we found that PAEs exposure results in the accumulation of ROS and the inhibition of SOD activation in vivo and in vitro. Notably, the mRNA levels of BER pathway-related genes (OGG1, NTHL1, APEX1, XRCC1, UNG, POLB, POLD, FEN1) were significantly upregulated after DBP or MEHP exposure, whereas the mRNA levels of NTHL1, UNG, POLB, POLD, and FEN1 were significantly altered in DEHP-treated HEK293T cells.

Complexes containing the Ku70/80 (""Ku"") and XRCC4/ligase IV (Lig4) core C-NHEJ factors are required, respectively, for sensing and joining DSBs. While XRCC4/Lig4 are absolutely required for joining RAG1/2 endonuclease (""RAG"")-initiated DSBs during V(D)J recombination in G1-phase progenitor lymphocytes, cycling cells deficient for XRCC4/Lig4 also can join chromosomal DSBs by alternative end-joining (A-EJ) pathways. Restriction of V(D)J recombination by XRCC4/Lig4-mediated joining has been attributed to RAG shepherding V(D)J DSBs exclusively into the C-NHEJ pathway. Here, we report that A-EJ of DSB ends generated by RAG1/2, Cas9:gRNA, and Zinc finger endonucleases in Lig4-deficient G1-arrested progenitor B cell lines is suppressed by Ku. Thus, while diverse DSBs remain largely as free broken ends in Lig4-deficient G1-arrested progenitor B cells, deletion of Ku70 increases DSB rejoining and translocation levels to those observed in Ku70-deficient counterparts. Correspondingly, while RAG-initiated V(D)J DSB joining is abrogated in Lig4-deficient G1-arrested progenitor B cell lines, joining of RAG-generated DSBs in Ku70-deficient and Ku70/Lig4 double-deficient lines occurs through a translocation-like A-EJ mechanism. Thus, in G1-arrested, Lig4-deficient progenitor B cells are functionally end-joining suppressed due to Ku-dependent blockage of A-EJ, potentially in association with G1-phase down-regulation of Lig1. Finally, we suggest that differential impacts of Ku deficiency versus Lig4 deficiency on V(D)J recombination, neuronal apoptosis, and embryonic development results from Ku-mediated inhibition of A-EJ in the G1 cell cycle phase in Lig4-deficient developing lymphocyte and neuronal cells.",0.0

Our results expand the functions of LIG1 to alternative NHEJ and demonstrate a remarkable ability for LIG3 to backup DSB repair by NHEJ in addition to its essential function in the mitochondria. Together with results on DNA replication, these observations uncover a remarkable and previously unappreciated functional flexibility and interchangeability between LIG1 and LIG3.",0.0

Here, we show highly and equally efficient gene knockout and knock-in at both transcriptionally active (HPRT1, KU80, LIG1, LIG3) and inactive (HB9) loci in these cells using high-capacity helper-dependent adenoviral vectors (HDAdVs). Without the necessity of introducing artificial DNA double-strand breaks, 7-81% of drug-resistant colonies were gene-targeted by accurate HR, which were not accompanied with additional ectopic integrations. Even at the motor neuron-specific HB9 locus, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene was accurately knocked in in 23-57% of drug-resistant colonies. In these clones, induced differentiation into the HB9-positive motor neuron correlated with EGFP expression. Furthermore, HDAdV infection had no detectable adverse effects on the undifferentiated state and pluripotency of hESCs and hiPSCs. These results suggest that HDAdV is one of the best methods for efficient and accurate gene targeting in hESCs and hiPSCs and might be especially useful for therapeutic applications.",0.0

LRIG1 is a predicted integral cell-surface protein showing similarities to Kekkon-1, the Drosophila melanogaster epidermal growth-factor-receptor antagonist. A specific peptide antibody, LRIG1-151, was raised in rabbits and used to study the LRIG1 protein. LRIG1 migrated in denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions as two species with apparent molecular weights of 143 kDa and 134 kDa, and as two fragments corresponding to an N-terminal 111-kDa species and a C-terminal 32-kDa species. Under non-reducing conditions, both apparent monomers and apparent higher molecular weight complexes were evident. Immunoblotting analysis of cell-surface-biotinylated lysates and confocal microscopy revealed that LRIG1 was localized to the cell surface in ZR-75 cells expressing endogenous LRIG1 and in COS-7 cells expressing a synthetic LRIG1-GFP fusion protein. Immunohistochemical analysis of normal human tissues showed staining for LRIG1 in epithelia in various organs, scattered neurons, and muscles. Immunoblotting demonstrated LRIG1 protein in tissue lysates from normal human prostate, mammary epithelial cells, ileum, stomach, lung, and cerebral cortex. These results demonstrate that LRIG1 is an integral cell-surface membrane protein that is expressed by specific cells in various human tissues and that its 143-kDa form might be cleaved into 111-kDa and 32-kDa fragments.",0.0

The study presents secondary analysis of our previous research. Three-day application of SOD and CAT in all forms of solution decreased the levels of CPD and 6-4PP boosted by UV irradiation. The mRNA expression level of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) system genes (XPA, XPC, ERCC1, ERCC2, ERCC3, LIG1) increased after application of immobilized and free enzymes.

A significant increase in DNA ligase I mRNA level is observed when cells are induced to proliferate, in agreement with the raise of DNA joining activity found in the same cell systems. The increase parallels the start of DNA synthesis, but the messenger remains at high level beyond the end of the S phase and is detected also in the presence of aphidicolin. A decrease in DNA ligase I mRNA is observed in HL-60 and NIH-3T3 cells after differentiation. The high stability of DNA ligase I mRNA in both resting and proliferating human fibroblasts suggests a cell proliferation dependent rate of transcription.

Base excision repair (BER) is the primary repair mechanism for oxidative genomic DNA damage. One prevalent oxidised base modification, 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), is recognised by 8-oxoguanine glycosylase-1 (OGG1) initiating removal and repair via BER. Surprisingly, Ogg1 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mOgg1-/- MEFs) do not accumulate 8-oxoG in the genome to the extent expected. This suggests that there are backup repair mechanisms capable of repairing 8-oxoG in the absence of OGG1. In the current study, we identified components of NER (Ercc1, Ercc4, Ercc5), BER (Lig1, Tdg, Nthl1, Mpg, Mgmt, NEIL3), MMR (Mlh1, Msh2, Msh6) and DSB (Brip1, Rad51d, Prkdc) pathways that are transcriptionally elevated in mOgg1-/- MEFs. Interestingly, all three nucleotide excision repair genes identified: Ercc1 (2.5 ± 0.2-fold), Ercc4 (1.5 ± 0.1-fold) and Ercc5 (1.7 ± 0.2-fold) have incision activity. There was also a significant functional increase in NER activity (42.0 ± 7.9%) compared to WT MEFs. We also observed upregulation of both Neil3 mRNA (37.9 ± 1.6-fold) and protein in mOgg1-/- MEFs. This was associated with a 3.4 ± 0.4-fold increase in NEIL3 substrate sites in genomic DNA of cells treated with BSO, consistent with the ability of NEIL3 to remove 8-oxoG oxidation products from genomic DNA. In conclusion, we suggest that in Ogg1-null cells, upregulation of multiple DNA repair proteins including incision components of the NER pathway and Neil3 are important compensatory responses to prevent the accumulation of genomic 8-oxoG.",0.0

We observed an association of CIN70 score and survival in 519 HNSCC patients in the TCGA dataset; the 15% patients with the lowest CIN70 score showed better survival (p = 0.11), but association was statistically non-significant. This correlated with the expression of 39 proteins of the major repair complexes. A positive association with survival was observed for MSH2, XRCC1, MRE11A, BRCA1, BRCA2, LIG1, DNA2, POLD1, MCM2, RAD54B, claspin, a negative for ERCC1, all related with replication. We hypothesized that expression of these factors leads to protection of replication through efficient repair and determines survival and resistance to therapy. Protein expression differences in HNSCC cell lines did not correlate with cellular sensitivity after treatment. Rather, it was observed that the stability of the DNA replication fork determined resistance, which was dependent on the ATR/CHK1-mediated S-phase signaling cascade.

This patient is a compound heterozygote for two previously unreported mutations in UHRF1: c.886C > T (p.R296W) and c.1852C > T (p.R618X). The R618X mutation plausibly caused nonsense-mediated decay, while the R296W mutation changed the higher order structure of UHRF1, which is indispensable for the maintenance of CG methylation along with DNMT1. Genome-wide methylation analysis revealed that the patient had a centromeric/pericentromeric hypomethylation, which is the main ICF signature, but also had a distinctive hypomethylation pattern compared to patients with the other ICF syndrome subtypes. Structural and biochemical analyses revealed that the R296W mutation disrupted the protein conformation and strengthened the binding affinity of UHRF1 with its partner LIG1, and reduced ubiquitylation activity of UHRF1 towards its ubiquitylation substrates, histone H3 and PAF15. We confirmed that the R296W mutation causes hypomethylation at pericentromeric repeats by generating the HEK293 cell-lines that mimic the patient's UHRF1 molecular context. Since proper interactions of the UHRF1 with LIG1, PAF15, and histone H3 are essential for the maintenance of CG methylation, the mutation could disturb the maintenance process. Evidence for the importance of the UHRF1 conformation for CG methylation in humans is, herein, provided for the first time, and deepens our understanding of its role in regulation of CG methylation.",0.0

The natural di-indole compound 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) is abundant in cruciferous vegetables and shows potent anti-tumor effects in multiple cancers. The synthesized Eflornithine (DFMO) is clinically used to treat African sleeping sickness. We demonstrated that the combination of DIM+DFMO could significantly suppress the ESCC growth in the in vivo study of three patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cases. Then, the corresponding underlying anticancer mechanisms were investigated via the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) on the proteome level. We found that the DNA Replication and Cell Cycle were the top-2 most significantly downregulated signaling pathways following the DIM+DFMO treatment. Correspondingly and interestingly, these two pathways were the top-2 upregulated ones in clinic ESCC tumors. Moreover, the involved differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including MCM2, MCM3, MCM5, MCM6, MCM7, CDK1, and LIG1 were all inversely downregulated by DIM+DFMO treatment. In the limited clinical study in two ESCC cases, the administration of DIM (250mg) +DFMO (500 mg) once daily showed favorable results, including alleviated swallowing difficulties, decreased blood tumor markers (CA19-9, CA15-3 and AFP), and no severe toxicity in at least one month progression free survival period.

It lacks the sequence insert responsible for calcium dependence in the calcium-dependent NOS isoenzymes. NOS expression was strongly up-regulated in Physarum macroplasmodia during the 5-day starvation period needed to induce sporulation competence. Induction of both NOS and sporulation competence were inhibited by glucose, a growth signal and known repressor of sporulation, and by L-N6-(1-iminoethyl)-lysine (NIL), an inhibitor of inducible NOS. Sporulation, which is triggered after the starvation period by light exposure, was also prevented by 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo-[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), an inhibitor of NO-sensitive guanylate cyclase. In addition, also expression of lig1, a sporulation-specific gene, was strongly attenuated by NIL or ODQ. 8-Bromo-cGMP, added 2 h before the light exposure, restored the capacity of NIL-treated macroplasmodia to express lig1 and to sporulate.

In the current study, we show that BRG1-EP300 complexes are accompanied by poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1), which emerges as the functional component of the promoter-bound multiprotein units that are capable of controlling gene expression. This enzyme is co-distributed with BRG1 at highly acetylated promoters of genes such as CDK4, LIG1, or NEIL3, which are responsible for cancer cell growth and the removal of DNA damage. ADP-ribosylation is necessary to maintain active transcription, since it ensures an open chromatin structure that allows high acetylation and low histone density. PARP1-mediated modification of BRG1 and EP300 does not affect the association of enzymes with gene promoters; however, it does activate EP300, which acetylates nucleosomes, leading to their eviction by BRG1, thus allowing mRNA synthesis. Although PARP1 was found at BRG1 positive/H3K27ac negative promoters of highly expressed genes in a transformed breast cancer cell line, its transcriptional activity was limited to genes simultaneously controlled by BRG1 and EP300, indicating that the ADP-ribosylation of EP300 plays a dominant role in the regulation of BRG1-EP300-driven transcription. In conclusion, PARP1 directs the transcription of some proliferation and DNA repair genes in breast cancer cells by the ADP-ribosylation of EP300, thereby causing its activation and marking nucleosomes for displacement by BRG1. PARP1 in rapidly dividing cells facilitates the expression of genes that confer a cancer cell phenotype. Our study shows a new mechanism that links PARP1 with the removal of DNA damage in breast cancer cells via the regulation of BRG1-EP300-dependent transcription of genes involved in DNA repair pathways.",0.0

The results indicated that nanoplastic exposure could decrease the hatching and survival rates of zebrafish embryos. In addition, the developmental toxicity test indicated that nanoplastic exposure exhibits developmental toxicity via the inhibition of the heart rate and body length in zebrafish embryos. Besides, behavioral activity was also significantly suppressed after 96 h of nanoplastic exposure in zebrafish larvae. Further biochemical assays revealed that nanoplastic-induced activation of the oxidative stress responses, including reactive oxygen species accumulation and enhanced superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, might affect developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay demonstrated that the mRNA levels of the base excision repair (BER) pathway-related genes, including lig1, lig3, polb, parp1, pold, fen1, nthl1, apex, xrcc1, and ogg1, were altered in zebrafish embryos for 24 h after nanoplastic exposure, indicating that the activation of the BER pathway would be stimulated after nanoplastic exposure in zebrafish embryos.

This lack of understanding is most evident in the case of classical allostery, in which a binding event in one protomer is sensed by a second symmetric protomer. A primary reason why study of interdomain signaling is challenging in oligomeric proteins is the difficulty in characterizing intermediate, singly bound species. Here, we use an NMR approach to isolate and characterize a singly ligated state (""lig1"") of a homodimeric enzyme that is otherwise obscured by rapid exchange with apo and saturated forms. Mixed labeled dimers were prepared that simultaneously permit full population of the lig1 state and isotopic labeling of either protomer. Direct visualization of peaks from lig1 yielded site-specific ligand-state multiplets that provide a convenient format for assessing mechanisms of intersubunit communication from a variety of NMR measurements. We demonstrate this approach on thymidylate synthase from Escherichia coli, a homodimeric enzyme known to be half-the-sites reactive. Resolving the dUMP1 state shows that active site communication occurs not upon the first dUMP binding, but upon the second.

UHRF1 is overexpressed in various cancer cells and down-regulation of UHRF1 in these cells reactivates the expression of tumor suppressor genes, thus UHRF1 is a promising target for cancer therapy.

Despite the major clinical relevance of mutation-associated resistance in CML, the mechanisms underlying mutation acquisition in TKI-treated leukemic cells are not well understood. This work demonstrated de novo acquisition of mutations on isolated single-cell sorted CML clones growing in the presence of imatinib. The acquisition of mutations was associated with the significantly increased expression of the LIG1 and PARP1 genes involved in the error-prone alternative nonhomologous end-joining pathway, leading to genomic instability, and increased expression of the UNG, FEN and POLD3 genes involved in the base-excision repair (long patch) pathway, allowing point mutagenesis. This work showed in vitro and in vivo that de novo acquisition of resistance-associated mutations in oncogenes is the prevalent method of somatic mutation development in CML under TKIs treatment.",0.0

Interestingly, the catalytic fragment of hLigI encircles a DNA nick forming a ring that is similar in size and shape to the PCNA ring. Here we show that the DNA binding domain (DBD) within the hLigI catalytic fragment interacts with both PCNA and the heterotrimeric cell-cycle checkpoint clamp, hRad9-hRad1-hHus1 (9-1-1). The DBD preferentially binds to trimeric PCNA and the hRad1 subunit of 9-1-1. Unlike the majority of PCNA interacting proteins, the DBD does not interact with the interdomain connector loop region of PCNA but instead appears to interact with regions adjacent to the intersubunit interfaces within the PCNA trimer. Notably, the DBD not only binds specifically to DNA nicks but also mediates the formation of DNA protein complexes with PCNA. Based on these results, we suggest that the interface between the DBD and PCNA acts as a pivot facilitating the transition of the hLigI catalytic region fragment from an extended conformation to a ring structure when it engages a DNA nick.",0.0

In the spleen and thymus of mutant mice, the accumulation of a sub-G1, but nonapoptotic, population was observed that we believe may represent cells with single-strand DNA breaks. In mutant bone marrow, occasional DNA replication failure was observed. The level of genome instability was significantly elevated in the spleens of DNA ligase I mutant mice and, because we have found no evidence for any DNA repair defect associated with DNA ligase I deficiency, we believe that this may result directly from the accumulation of replication intermediates. Mutant mice showed an increased incidence of spontaneous cancers with a diverse range of epithelial tumors, particularly cutaneous adnexal tumors that are rare in mice. The origin of the tumors from generalized genome instability, rather than the inactivation of one key control gene, should make DNA ligase I mutant mice a useful model to investigate the relationship between genome instability and cancer in humans.",0.0

In addition, cancer cells can rapidly respond to conventional and targeted therapies by accumulating novel and often specific genetic lesions leading to acquired drug resistance and relapsing disease. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), however, diverse chromosomal aberrations often occur. In many cases, improper repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) is a major source for genomic abnormalities. Therefore, this study examined the repair of DNA DSBs by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) in CLL by performing plasmid-based repair assays in primary CLL cells and normal B cells, isolated from patients, as well as TALEN/Cas9-induced chromosomal deletions in the CLL cell line Mec1. It is demonstrated that DNA repair is aberrant in CLL cells, featuring perturbed DNA break structure preference with efficient joining of noncohesive ends and more deletions at repair junctions. In addition, increased microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) of DNA substrates was observed in CLL together with increased expression of MMEJ-specific repair factors. In summary, these data identify major differences in DNA repair efficiency between CLL cells and normal B cells isolated from patients.Implications: This study suggests inherently aberrant DNA DSB repair in the acquisition of subclonal genomic structural variations important for clonal evolution and treatment resistance in CLL.

Here we evaluated the combination of KPT-8602 with PARP inhibitors (PARPi) olaparib, veliparib and rucaparib in 22rv1 mCRPC cells. KPT-8602 synergized with PARPi (CI < 1) at pharmacologically relevant concentrations.

The conversion of rcDNA into cccDNA requires preparation of the extremities at the nick/gap regions of rcDNA for strand ligation. After screening 107 cellular DNA repair genes, we herein report that the cellular DNA ligase (LIG) 1 and 3 play a critical role in cccDNA formation. Ligase inhibitors or functional knock down/out of LIG1/3 significantly reduced cccDNA production in an in vitro cccDNA formation assay, and in cccDNA-producing cells without direct effect on viral core DNA replication. In addition, transcomplementation of LIG1/3 in the corresponding knock-out or knock-down cells was able to restore cccDNA formation. Furthermore, LIG4, a component in non-homologous end joining DNA repair apparatus, was found to be responsible for cccDNA formation from the viral double stranded linear (dsl) DNA, but not rcDNA. In conclusion, we demonstrate that hepadnaviruses utilize the whole spectrum of host DNA ligases for cccDNA formation, which sheds light on a coherent molecular pathway of cccDNA biosynthesis, as well as the development of novel antiviral strategies for treatment of hepatitis B.",0.0

However, tumor heterogeneity presents a significant technical challenge for most cancer genomics studies performed at less than 100× mean resolution depth. To address the importance of genomic instability in prostate carcinogenesis and tumor progression, we performed ultrahigh depth exome sequencing of 124 DNA damage repair/response (repairome) genes in 63 tumors and matched normal tissue samples in African Americans and Caucasians. The average sequence depth was 712-fold for DNA isolated from normal tissue and 368-fold for FFPE tumors. We identified 671 somatic mutations in tumors from African Americans and 762 somatic mutations in tumors in Caucasians. The most frequently mutated DNA repairome genes were EXO1, ATR, POLQ, NEIL3, ERCC6, BRCA2, BRCA1, XPC, JAG1, RPA1, POLE, ATM, and LIG1 in African American men, and POLQ, NEIL3, POLB, BRCA2, EXO1, ERCC6, ATR, RBBP8, BRCA1, ATM, JAG1, XPC, and POLE in Caucasians. We found that 89% of tumors had at least one mutation in nucleotide excision repair pathway genes in African Americans, whereas >40% of tumors had mutations in base excision repair pathway genes in Caucasians. We further identified a marginal increase in mutation rate in tumors in African Americans with increasing age. Tumors in Caucasians did not show a correlation with age, but a progressive increase in the mutation rate was observed at higher Gleason scores. Our data reveal significant differences in the molecular signatures in the DNA repairome in prostate cancer between African Americans and Caucasians.

We found that the two protein families evolved slowly; however, the MAGO family under stringent purifying selection evolved more slowly than the Y14 family that was under relative relaxed purifying selection. MAGO and Y14 were obliged to form heterodimer in a eukaryotic organism, and this obligate mode was plesiomorphic. Lack of binding of MAGO to Y14 as functional barrier was observed only among distantly species, suggesting that a slow co-evolution of the two protein families.

Dysfunction of WsMAGO2 through double-stranded RNAi in Withania revealed suppression of RNA transcripts, non-viable pollens, fewer flowers and aborted non-viable seeds in the developing berry suggesting a role of this protein in many traits particularly male fertility. WsMAGO2 flaunted stronger yeast 2-hybrid interactions with MPF2-like proteins WSA206, WSB206 and TAB201 than other MAGO counterparts. The native transcripts of WsMAGO2 culminated in stamens and seed-bearing berries though other MAGO orthologs also exhibited expression albeit at lower level. Coding sequences of the two orthologs are highly conserved, but they differ substantially in their upstream promoter regions. Remarkably, WsMAGO2 promoter is enriched with many anther-specific cis-motifs common in fertility function genes promoters. Among them, disruption of GAATTTGTGA abolished YFP/GUS gene expression in anthers alluding towards its involvement in regulating expression of MAGO in anther. Our findings support a possible recruitment of WsMAGO2 in fertility trait in Withania. These genes have practical application in hybrid production through cytoplasmic male sterility maintenance for enhancement in crops yield.",0.0
514,Gene ,PUBMED: 29653229; ,"The exon junction complex (EJC) is a key element of the splicing machinery. The EJC core is composed of eIF4A3, MAGO, Y14 and MLN51. Few accessory proteins, such as CWC22 or UPF3, bind transiently to the EJC. The EJC has been implicated in the control of the splicing of long introns. To ascertain whether the EJC controls the splicing of short introns, we used Paramecium tetraurelia as a model organism, since it has thousands of very tiny introns. To elucidate whether EJC affects intron splicing in P. tetraurelia, we searched for EJC protein-coding genes, and silenced those genes coding for eIF4A3, MAGO and CWC22. We found that P. tetraurelia likely assembles an active EJC with only three of the core proteins, since MLN51 is lacking. Silencing of eIF4A3 or CWC22 genes, but not that of MAGO, caused lethality. Silencing of the MAGO gene caused either an increase, decrease, or no change in intron retention levels of some intron-containing mRNAs used as reporters. We suggest that a fine-tuning expression of EJC genes is required for steady intron removal in P. tetraurelia. Taking into consideration our results and those published by others, we conclude that the EJC controls splicing independently of the intron size.",0.0

Little is known about the biochemical and cellular characteristics of the EJC and its orthologs in plants. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis Mago and Y14 form a ternary complex with PYM, an RNA-binding protein that was previously shown to interact with the Mago-Y14 heterodimer in Drosophila. Fluorescence microscopy indicated that Arabidopsis Mago and Y14 are localized primarily in the nucleus, whereas PYM is mostly cytoplasmic. In vitro pull-down assays using recombinant proteins showed that the amino-terminal region of the Arabidopsis PYM interacts with the Mago-Y14 heterodimer, a similar observation to that previously reported for the animal versions of these proteins. However, we demonstrated also that Arabidopsis PYM has the ability to interact with monomeric Mago and monomeric Y14. Immunoprecipitation and tandem affinity purification from whole cell extracts detected a subtle interaction between the Arabidopsis Mago-Y14 heterodimer and PYM in flowers, indicating that the ternary complex is not abundant in plant cells. The regions of the polypeptide responsible for nuclear import and export were defined using protein truncations and site-directed mutagenesis.

Single MAGO down-regulation in rice did not lead to any phenotypic variation; however, double gene knockdowns generated short rice plants with abnormal flowers, and the stamens of these flowers showed inhibited degradation and absorption of both endothecium and tapetum, suggesting that OsMAGO1 and OsMAGO2 were functionally redundant. OsY14a knockdowns phenocopied OsMAGO1OsMAGO2 mutants, while down-regulation of OsY14b failed to induce plantlets, suggesting the functional specialization of OsY14b in embryogenesis. OsMAGO1OsMAGO2OsY14a triple down-regulation enhanced the phenotypes of OsMAGO1OsMAGO2 and OsY14a down-regulated mutants, indicating that they exert developmental roles in the MAGO-Y14 heterodimerization mode.

Epistasis analysis shows that ectopic sperm production caused by mag-1(RNAi) is prevented by loss-of-function (lf) mutations in fog-2, gld-1, fem-1, fem-2, fem-3, and fog-1, all of which cause germ-line feminization in XX hermaphrodites, but not by a her-1(lf) mutation which causes germ-line feminization only in XO males. These results suggest that mag-1 interacts with the fog, fem, and gld genes and acts independently of her-1. We propose that mag-1 normally allows oogenesis by inhibiting function of one or more of these masculinizing genes, which act during the fourth larval stage to promote transient sperm production in the hermaphrodite germ line.

The multi-protein exon junction complex (EJC) associates with mRNAs concomitant with splicing in the nucleus and plays important roles in export, translation, surveillance and localization of mRNAs in the cytoplasm. In mammalian cells, the ribosome associated protein PYM (HsPYM) binds the Y14-Mago heterodimer moiety of the EJC core, and disassembles EJCs, presumably during the pioneer round of translation. However, the significance of the association of the EJC with mRNAs in a physiological context has not been tested and the function of PYM in vivo remains unknown. Here we address PYM function in Drosophila, where the EJC core proteins are genetically required for oskar mRNA localization during oogenesis. We provide evidence that the EJC binds oskar mRNA in vivo. Using an in vivo transgenic approach, we show that elevated amounts of the Drosophila PYM (DmPYM) N-terminus during oogenesis cause dissociation of EJCs from oskar RNA, resulting in its mislocalization and consequent female sterility. We find that, in contrast to HsPYM, DmPYM does not interact with the small ribosomal subunit and dismantles EJCs in a translation-independent manner upon over-expression. Biochemical analysis shows that formation of the PYM-Y14-Mago ternary complex is modulated by the PYM C-terminus revealing that DmPYM function is regulated in vivo. Furthermore, we find that whereas under normal conditions DmPYM is dispensable, its loss of function is lethal to flies with reduced y14 or mago gene dosage. Our analysis demonstrates that the amount of DmPYM relative to the EJC proteins is critical for viability and fertility. This, together with the fact that the EJC-disassembly activity of DmPYM is regulated, implicates PYM as an effector of EJC homeostasis in vivo.",0.0

AtMago, AtY14, and AtPYM are encoded by single genes that show similar expression patterns and contain common regulatory elements, known as site II, that are required for expression. AtPYM and AtY14 are phosphorylated by plant extracts and this modification regulates complex formation between both proteins. In addition, overexpression of AtMago and AtY14 in plants produces an increase in AtPYM protein levels, while overexpression of AtPYM results in increased formation of a complex that contains the three proteins. The effect of AtMago and AtY14 on AtPYM expression is most likely to be due to intron-mediated enhacement of AtPYM expression, since the AtPYM gene contains a leader intron that is required for expression. Indeed, transient transformation asssays indicated that the three proteins are able to increase expression from reporter constructs that contain leader introns required for the expression of different genes.

This report demonstrates that several cereal rust species (Puccinia graminis f. sp tritici, P. triticina, P. striiformis, and P. hordei) can infect rice and produce all the infection structures necessary for plant colonization, including specialized feeding cells (haustoria). Some rust infection sites are remarkably large and many plant cells are colonized, suggesting that nutrient uptake occurs to support this growth. Rice responds with an active, nonhost resistance (NHR) response that prevents fungal sporulation and that involves callose deposition, production of reactive oxygen species, and, occasionally, cell death. Genetic variation for the efficacy of NHR to wheat stem rust and wheat leaf rust was observed. Unlike cereal rusts, the rust pathogen (Melampsora lini) of the dicotyledenous plant flax (Linum usitatissimum) rarely successfully infects rice due to an apparent inability to recognize host-derived signals. Morphologically abnormal infection structures are produced and appressorial-like structures often don't coincide with stomata. These data suggest that basic compatibility is an important determinate of nonhost infection outcomes of rust diseases on cereals, with cereal rusts being more capable of infecting a cereal nonhost species compared with rust species that are adapted for dicot hosts.",0.0

Several highly diverged -pathogen classes have independently evolved haustoria, suggesting that they represent an effective adaptation for growing within living plant tissue. Despite their clear importance in biotrophy, they have been difficult to study due to the close association of biotrophic pathogens with their host and the inability to produce haustoria in vitro. These drawbacks have been circumvented in the study of rust fungi by the development of a haustoria isolation technique. The strong binding of the lectin concanavalin A (ConA) to rust haustoria allows these structures to be purified from infected plant tissue by affinity chromatography on a ConA-Sepharose macrobead column. The isolation process results in substantial yields of intact haustoria that retain their cytoplasmic contents, making them amenable to experimentation. The construction of cDNA libraries from isolated rust haustoria and their subsequent sequence analysis have provided significant insight into haustoria function at a molecular level, revealing important roles in nutrient acquisition and the delivery of pathogenicity effector proteins.

Exploring miRNA-dependent molecular networks is a major challenge in cancer research. In this study, we performed RNA-sequencing of breast cancer (BrCa) clinical specimens to identify tumor-suppressive miRNA in BrCa. In total, 64 miRNA were identified as candidate tumor-suppressive miRNA in BrCa cells. Analysis of our BrCa signature revealed that several miRNA duplexes (guide strand/passenger strand) derived from pre-miRNA were downregulated in BrCa tissues (e.g. miR-99a-5p/-3p, miR-101-5p/-3p, miR-126-5p/-3p, miR-143-5p/-3p, and miR-144-5p/-3p). Among these miRNA, we focused on miR-101-5p, the passenger strand of pre-miR-101, and investigated its tumor-suppressive roles and oncogenic targets in BrCa cells. Low expression of miR-101-5p predicted poor prognosis in patients with BrCa (overall survival rate: P = 0.0316). Ectopic expression of miR-101-5p attenuated aggressive phenotypes, e.g. proliferation, migration, and invasion, in BrCa cells. Finally, we identified seven putative oncogenic genes (i.e. High Mobility Group Box 3, Epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1, GINS complex subunit 1 (GINS1), Tumor Protein D52, Serine/Arginine-Rich Splicing Factor Kinase 1, Vang-like protein 1, and Mago Homolog B) regulated by miR-101-5p in BrCa cells.

During vegetative growth, many meiotic genes are constitutively transcribed, but most of the resulting mRNAs are rapidly eliminated by the Mmi1-MTREC (Mtl1-Red1 core) complex. While Mmi1-MTREC targets premature meiotic RNAs for degradation by the nuclear 3'-5' exoribonuclease exosome during mitotic growth, its role in meiotic gene expression during meiosis is not known. Here, we report that Red5, an essential MTREC component, interacts with pFal1, an ortholog of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4aIII in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe In mammals, together with MAGO (Mnh1), Rnps1, and Y14, elF4AIII (pFal1) forms the core of the exon junction complex (EJC), which is essential for transcriptional surveillance and localization of mature mRNAs. In fission yeast, two EJC orthologs, pFal1 and Mnh1, are functionally connected with MTREC, specifically in the process of meiotic gene expression during meiosis. Although pFal1 interacts with Mnh1, Y14, and Rnps1, its association with Mnh1 is not disrupted upon loss of Y14 or Rnps1. Mutations of Red1, Red5, pFal1, or Mnh1 produce severe meiotic defects; the abundance of meiotic transcripts during meiosis decreases; and mRNA maturation processes such as splicing are impaired.

Traditional suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and RNA-Seq usually screen out thousands of differentially expressed genes. However, identification of the most important regulators has not been performed to date. Here, we employed two methods, namely, a two-round SSH and two-factor transcriptome analysis derived from the two-factor ANOVA that is commonly used in the statistics, to identify development-associated inorganic phosphate (Pi) starvation-induced genes in Brassica napus. Several of these genes are related to ethylene signaling (such as EIN3, ACO3, ACS8, ERF1A, and ERF2) or sugar metabolism (such as ACC2, GH3, LHCB1.4, XTH4, and SUS2). Although sucrose and ethylene may counteract each other at the biosynthetic level, they may also work synergistically on Pi-starvation-induced gene expression (such as PT1, PT2, RNS1, ACP5, AT4, and IPS1) and root acid phosphatase activation.

To study the expression of those genes throughout first stages of spermatogenesis, we used nylon macroarray. Gonads in stage of immaturity (stage I), or at initiation of spermatogonial proliferation (stage II), meiosis (stage III) or spermiogenesis were selected by histological analysis. Total RNA was extracted and then used to produce complex targets labelled with [33P]dCTP and hybridised with cDNA arrays. After filtering and normalisation of hybridisation signals, genes presenting differential expression as revealed by ANOVA analysis were submitted to k-means clustering and hierarchical classification. Genes were separated into five clusters which presented distinct profiles. One cluster overexpressed in stage I could be involved in the initial events of spermatogenesis as seminiferous tubule organisation. The second cluster displays a transient increase at the beginning of testicular recrudescence (stage II). Three other clusters group several genes involved in cell proliferation and protein synthesis and modification. One is particularly down-expressed during stage I, the two others show increased expression during stages III and IV and appear to be involved in spermatogonial and meiotic proliferation and in protein metabolism linked to cellular growth.

Similarly, Sr2-dependent resistance to powdery mildew was associated with the death of leaf mesophyll cells around mildew infection sites. We demonstrate that PBC occurring in the absence of pathogen inoculation also corresponds with death and the collapse of photosynthetic cells in the affected parts of stems and ears. In addition, Sr2-dependent necrosis was inducible in leaves by application of petroleum jelly or by heat treatments.

The cloned gene was functionally validated as Pm8 by transient, single-cell expression analysis and stable transformation. Sequence analysis revealed a complex mosaic of ancient haplotypes among Pm3- and Pm8-like genes from different members of the Triticeae. These results show that the two genes have evolved independently after the divergence of the species 7.5 million years ago and kept their function in mildew resistance. During this long time span the co-evolving pathogens have not overcome these genes, which is in strong contrast to the breakdown of Pm8 resistance since its introduction into commercial wheat 70 years ago. Sequence comparison revealed that evolutionary pressure acted on the same subdomains and sequence features of the two orthologous genes. This suggests that they recognize directly or indirectly the same pathogen effectors that have been conserved in the powdery mildews of wheat and rye.",0.0

The DEAD-box protein eIF4AIII encloses an ATP molecule and provides the binding sites for six ribonucleotides. Btz wraps around eIF4AIII and stacks against the 5' nucleotide. An intertwined network of interactions anchors Mago-Y14 and Btz at the interface between the two domains of eIF4AIII, effectively stabilizing the ATP bound state.

Mutations in GJB2 are responsible for 40% of genetic childhood deafness. The most common mutation, 35delG, predominates in many ethnic groups. Some families with linkage to the DFNB1 locus have none or only one mutated allele in GJB2, however, some subjects can exhibit a large deletion in another connexin gene, GJB6, resulting in a monogenic or digenic pattern of inheritance in this complex DFNB1 locus that contains both genes (GJB2 and GJB6). The aim of the study was to determine (1) the frequency for the 35delG (27.5%), del(GJB6-D13S1830) (2.5%) and del(GJB6-D13S1854) (0.0%) mutations in a cohort of 40 Venezuelan patients with ARNSHL and (2) the carrier frequency 35delG (4%), del(GJB6-D13S1830) (0%) and del(GJB6-D13S1854) (0%) in the Venezuelan population with no familial history of hearing impairment.

We have isolated overlapping cDNA and genomic clones encoding the entire phyB polypeptide. This monocot sequence is more closely related to phyB from the dicot, Arabidopsis (73% amino acid sequence identity), than it is to the phyA gene in the rice genome (50% identity). These data support the proposal that phyA and phyB subfamilies diverged early in plant evolution and that subsequent divergence accompanied the evolution of monocots and dicots. Moreover, since rice and Arabidopsis phyB polypeptides are more closely related to one another (73% identity) than are monocot and dicot phyA sequences (63-65% identity), it appears that phyB has evolved more slowly than phyA. Sequence conservation between phyA and phyB is greatest in a central core region surrounding the chromophore attachment site, and least toward the amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal ends of the polypeptides, although hydropathy analysis suggests that the overall structure of the two phytochromes has been conserved. Gene-specific Northern blot analysis indicates that, whereas phyA is negatively regulated by phytochrome in rice seedling shoots in the manner typical of monocots, phyB is constitutively expressed irrespective of light treatment. In consequence, phyA and phyB transcripts are equally abundant in fully green tissue. Since Arabidopsis phyB mRNA levels are also unaffected by light, the present results suggest that this mode of regulation is evolutionarily conserved among phyB genes, perhaps reflecting differences in the functional roles of the different phytochrome subfamilies.",0.0

Results showed that irradiation with diffused 630-nm light induced formation and subsequent increase in sizes of the MLOs.

We analyzed our experimental data using a mathematical model containing multiple Pfr conformers, in accordance with previous findings.

Specifically, it was determined that the leaf blade : leaf sheath elongation of phyB-1 is responsive to red : far red (R : FR), but this response is opposite that of wild type (WT). Reducing the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) strongly reduced the leaf blade : leaf sheath of WT but did not affect phyB-1, demonstrating a role for phyB in sensing PPFD. Using light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, it was found that WT ethylene production was increased with low R : FR while PPFD had no effect. Conversely, phyB-1 ethylene production increased only with high PPFD, high R : FR which was the treatment resulting in the least ethylene production by WT. Elevated ethylene production inhibits shoot elongation, but may contribute to shade avoidance by reducing leaf blade : leaf sheath elongation. Ethylene responses to light treatments designed to promote or reduce phytochrome A (phyA) activity, and the analysis of PHYA levels in the two cultivars suggests that phyA could be involved in transducing shade signals in light-grown sorghum.

BBX4 associates with PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3 (PIF3) and represses PIF3 transcriptional activation activity and PIF3-controlled gene expression. The degradation of BBX4 in darkness is dependent on CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) and the 26S proteasome system.

Here, we show that a set of four SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 (SPA) genes is required for thermomorphogenesis. Consistently, SPAs are necessary for global changes in gene expression in response to high ambient temperature. In the spaQ mutant at high ambient temperature, the level of SPA1 is unaffected, whereas the thermosensor phytochrome B (phyB) is stabilized. Furthermore, in the absence of four SPA genes, the pivotal transcription factor PIF4 fails to accumulate, indicating a role of SPAs in regulating the phyB-PIF4 module at high ambient temperature. SPA1 directly phosphorylates PIF4 in vitro, and a mutant SPA1 affecting the kinase activity fails to rescue the PIF4 level in addition to the thermo-insensitive phenotype of spaQ, suggesting that the SPA1 kinase activity is necessary for thermomorphogenesis.

WRKY2 and WRKY10 form heterodimers and recognize their target site in the PIF4 promoter near the MYB element that is bound by CCA1 and LHY under red and blue light.

The two WRKY proteins also interact with phyB, and their interaction enhances the targeting of CCA1 and LHY to the PIF4 promoter. SHB1 associates with the WRKY2 and WRKY10 loci and enhances their expression in parallel with the PIF4 expression peaks. This forward regulatory loop further sustains the accumulation of the two WRKY proteins and the targeting of CCA1/LHY to the PIF4 locus.

In this study, we investigated the role of phyA and phyB in regulating leaf senescence under FR in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). FR enrichment and intermittent FR pulses promoted the senescence of Arabidopsis leaves. Additionally, phyA and phyB mutants showed enhanced and repressed senescence phenotypes in FR, respectively, indicating that phyA and phyB antagonistically regulate FR-dependent leaf senescence. Transcriptomic analysis using phyA and phyB mutants in FR identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in leaf senescence-related processes, such as responses to light, phytohormones, temperature, photosynthesis and defense, showing opposite expression patterns in phyA and phyB mutants. These contrasting expression profiles of DEGs support the antagonism between phyA and phyB in FR-dependent leaf senescence. Among the genes showing antagonistic regulation, we confirmed that the expression of WRKY6, which encodes a senescence-associated transcription factor, was negatively and positively regulated by phyA and phyB, respectively. The wrky6 mutant showed a repressed senescence phenotype compared with the wild type in FR, indicating that WRKY6 plays a positive role in FR-dependent leaf senescence.

However, the upstream guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) RopGEFs have not been revealed, and it is unclear which photoreceptor is required for the action of RopGEFs-ROPs. Here, we showed that RopGEF2 acted as a negative regulator in phytochrome B (phyB)-mediated red light-induced stomatal opening.

RopGEF2 interacted with ROP7 and ROP2 and enhanced their intrinsic nucleotide exchange rates. Furthermore, the direct interactions between phyB and RopGEF2 were detected in vitro and in plants, and phyB enhanced the GEF activity of RopGEF2 toward both ROP7 and ROP2 under light. In addition, RopGEF4 functioned redundantly with RopGEF2 in red light-induced stomatal opening by activating both ROP7 and ROP2, and RopGEF2/RopGEF4 acted genetically downstream of phyB; however, the GEF activity of RopGEF4 was not directly enhanced by phyB.

When mobilized by the Arabidopsis thaliana β-glucosidase 1 (AtBG1), the glucose ester-conjugated inactive form of ABA has proven to be a source of the active hormone that is essential for the adaptation of the plant to water deficit, as evidenced by the impaired stomatal closure of atbg1 mutants in response to water stress.

Our study reveals that atbg1 plants harbor increased stomatal density in addition to impaired stomatal closure. We also provide evidence that the vat1/phyb mutation can restore the apparent transpiration of the atbg1 mutant by decreasing stomatal aperture and restoring a stomatal density similar to wild-type plants. Expression of key regulators of stomatal development showed a crosstalk between AtBG1-mediated ABA signaling and PHYB-mediated stomatal development.

In contrast, phytochrome B appears both necessary and sufficient for a light-mediated decrease in PHYB activity in shoots, and phytochrome A mediates a far-red-light-stimulated increase in PHYB promoter activity. Together, the data indicate that the PHYA and PHYB genes are regulated in divergent fashion at the transcriptional level, both developmentally and by the spectral distribution of the prevailing light, and that this regulation may be important to the photosensory function of the two photoreceptors.",0.0

Tillering is inhibited in sorghum genotypes that lack phytochrome B (58M, phyB-1) until after floral initiation. The growth of tiller buds in the first leaf axil of wild-type (100M, PHYB) and phyB-1 sorghum genotypes is similar until 6 d after planting when buds of phyB-1 arrest growth, while wild-type buds continue growing and develop into tillers. Transcriptome analysis at this early stage of bud development identified numerous genes that were up to 50-fold differentially expressed in wild-type/phyB-1 buds. Up-regulation of terminal flower1, GA2oxidase, and TPPI could protect axillary meristems in phyB-1 from precocious floral induction and decrease bud sensitivity to sugar signals. After bud growth arrest in phyB-1, expression of dormancy-associated genes such as DRM1, GT1, AF1, and CKX1 increased and ENOD93, ACCoxidase, ARR3/6/9, CGA1, and SHY2 decreased. Continued bud outgrowth in wild-type was correlated with increased expression of genes encoding a SWEET transporter and cell wall invertases. The SWEET transporter may facilitate Suc unloading from the phloem to the apoplast where cell wall invertases generate monosaccharides for uptake and utilization to sustain bud outgrowth. Elevated expression of these genes was correlated with higher levels of cytokinin/sugar signaling in growing buds of wild-type plants.",0.0

To determine whether differential temporal or spatial expression patterns of the PHYA and PHYB genes contribute to this phenomenon the expression of PHYA-GUS and PHYB-GUS reporter genes has been examined in transgenic Arabidopsis. Histochemical and quantitative biochemical analyses indicate that both transgenes are expressed extensively throughout the plant, including roots, shoots and flowers, during the entire life cycle, but with strong differences between the two in expression level and photoregulation, and more limited differences in spatial expression patterns. The data indicate that regulation is at the transcriptional level. In dry seed, PHYB-GUS is expressed throughout the embryo at three-fold higher levels than PHYB-GUS, which is confined primarily to the embryonic root tip. By contrast, PHYA promoter activity, despite strong negative regulation in shoots by light, is consistently higher than PHYB (two- to 20-fold) in both the light and dark in most tissues during all subsequent developmental phases, from seedling to mature adult. At the tissue level, most cells appear to express both transgenes at some level at all stages examined, with highest apparent activity in vascular tissue and root tips. With the notable exception of pollen, where high PHYB-GUS but not PHYA-GUS expression occurs, few major differences are observed in the quantitative spatial distribution pattern between the two transgenes. The strongly similar spatial and temporal expression patterns of PHYA-GUS and PHYB-GUS transgenes suggest that the differential photosensory activity of these two phytochromes occurs largely through differences in their (i) intrinsic biochemical activities, (ii) relative abundances, and/or (iii) independent and separate reaction partners, rather than through discrete, developmentally controlled expression patterns.",0.0

However, how SVP, FLC, and ELF3 mediate LHY/CCA1 and flowering time is not fully understood. We found that lhy;cca1 exhibited short hypocotyls and petioles under LL, but the molecular mechanism for these effects has not been elucidated. To address these questions, we performed a screen for mutations that suppress either or both of the lhy;cca1 phenotypes under LL, using two different approaches. We identified two novel mutations, a dominant (del1) and a recessive (phyB-2511) allele of phyB. The flowering times of single mutants of three phyB alleles, hy3-1, del1, and phyB-2511, are almost the same and earlier than those of wild-type plants.

Remarkable overaccumulation of monosaccharide, such as glucose (53.4-fold), fructose (42.5-fold), and galactose (24.5-fold), was observed in young leaves of phyA phyB phyC triple mutants.

We concluded that the cause of reduced root nodule formation in phyB mutants was the inhibition of JA-Ile production in root. Here we show that the shoot JA-Ile level of phyB mutants is higher than that of the wild-type strain MG20, suggesting that translocation of JA-Ile from shoot to root is impeded in the mutant.

We also found that the expression of numerous JA biosynthesis genes was promoted upon treatment with red or white light when compared to that of darkness, and that this promotion is dependent on phyB.

The cryptochrome and phytochrome signaling mechanisms interact directly with CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1), a RING motif-containing E3 ligase that acts to negatively regulate photomorphogenesis. COP1 interacts with and ubiquitinates the transcription factors that promote photomorphogenesis, such as ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 and LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED1 (HFR1), to inhibit photomorphogenic development. Here, we show that COP1 physically interacts with PIF3-LIKE1 (PIL1) and promotes PIL1 degradation via the 26S proteasome. We further demonstrate that phyB physically interacts with PIL1 and enhances PIL1 protein accumulation upon red light irradiation, probably through suppressing the COP1-PIL1 association. Biochemical and genetic studies indicate that PIL1 and HFR1 form heterodimers and promote photomorphogenesis cooperatively. Moreover, we demonstrate that PIL1 interacts with PIF1, 3, 4, and 5, resulting in the inhibition of the transcription of PIF direct-target genes. Our results reveal that PIL1 stability is regulated by phyB and COP1, likely through physical interactions, and that PIL1 coordinates with HFR1 to inhibit the transcriptional activity of PIFs, suggesting that PIL1, HFR1, and PIFs constitute a subset of antagonistic basic helix-loop-helix factors acting downstream of phyB and COP1 to regulate photomorphogenic development.",0.0

The intracellular signaling pathway from the light-activated photoreceptor conformer (Pfr) to the transcriptional network that drives these responses involves direct, physical interaction of Pfr with a small subfamily of bHLH transcription factors, termed Phy-Interacting Factors (PIFs), which induces rapid PIF proteolytic degradation. In addition, there is evidence of further complexity in light-grown seedlings, whereby phyB-PIF interaction reciprocally induces phyB degradation, in a mutually-negative, feedback-loop configuration. Here, to assess the relative contributions of these antagonistic activities to the net phenotypic readout in light-grown seedlings, we have examined the magnitude of the light- and simulated-shade-induced responses of a pentuple phyBpif1pif3pif4pif5 (phyBpifq) mutant and various multiple pif-mutant combinations. The data (1) reaffirm that phyB is the predominant, if not exclusive, photoreceptor imposing the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in deetiolating seedlings in response to prolonged continuous R irradiation and (2) show that the PIF quartet (PIF1, PIF3, PIF4, and PIF5) retain and exert a dual capacity to modulate hypocotyl elongation under these conditions, by concomitantly promoting cell elongation through intrinsic transcriptional-regulatory activity, and reducing phyB-inhibitory capacity through feedback-loop-induced phyB degradation. In shade-exposed seedlings, immunoblot analysis shows that the shade-imposed reduction in Pfr levels induces increases in the abundance of PIF3, and mutant analysis indicates that PIF3 acts, in conjunction with PIF4 and PIF5, to promote the known shade-induced acceleration of hypocotyl elongation. Conversely, although the quadruple pifq mutant displays clearly reduced hypocotyl elongation compared to wild-type in response to prolonged shade, immunoblot analysis detects no elevation in phyB levels in the mutant seedlings compared to the wild-type during the majority of the shade-induced growth period, and phyB levels are not robustly correlated with the growth phenotype across the pif-mutant combinations compared. These results suggest that PIF feedback modulation of phyB abundance does not play a dominant role in modulating the magnitude of the PIF-promoted, shade-responsive phenotype under these conditions. In seedlings grown under diurnal light-dark cycles, the data show that FR-pulse-induced removal of Pfr at the beginning of the dark period (End-of-Day-FR (EOD-FR) treatment) results in longer hypocotyls relative to no EOD-FR treatment and that this effect is attenuated in the pif-mutant combinations tested. This result similarly indicates that the PIF quartet members are capable of intrinsically promoting hypocotyl cell elongation in light-grown plants, independently of the effects of PIF feedback modulation of photoactivated-phyB abundance.",0.0

However, we have shown that the production of chromophores used in Phytochrome B (PhyB) optogenetics is greatly enhanced in mammalian cells by expressing bacterial and plant Fds with ferredoxin-NADP+ reductases (FNR). We delineated the rate limiting factors and found that the main metabolic precursor, heme, was not the primary limiting factor for producing either the cyanobacterial or plant chromophores, phycocyanobilin or phytochromobilin, respectively. In fact, Fd is limiting, followed by Fd+FNR and finally heme. Using these findings, we optimized the PCB production system and combined it with a tissue penetrating red/far-red sensing PhyB optogenetic gene switch in animal cells. We further characterized this system in several mammalian cell lines using red and far-red light. Importantly, we found that the light-switchable gene system remains active for several hours upon illumination, even with a short light pulse, and requires very small amounts of light for maximal activation.

Chloroplast movements in wild-type plants were intermediate between those of the single phot mutants, consistent with each operating through separate signalling cascades.

To gain insight into the molecular mechanism underlying this complex phenotype, we generated transgenic lines expressing the mutant and wild-type phyB in phyB-9 background. Analysis of these transgenic lines demonstrated that the mutant photoreceptor displays a reduced rate of dark-reversion but normal P(fr) to P(r) photoconversion in vivo and shows an altered pattern of association/dissociation with nuclear bodies compared to wild-type phyB. In addition we show (i) an enhanced responsiveness to far-red light for hypocotyl growth inhibition and CAB2 expression and (ii) that far-red light mediated photoreversibility of red light induced responses, including inhibition of hypocotyl growth, formation of nuclear bodies and induction of CAB2 expression is reduced in these transgenic lines. We hypothesize that the incomplete photoreversibility of signalling is due to the fact that far-red light induced photoconversion of the chromophore is at least partially uncoupled from the P(fr) to P(r) conformation change of the protein. It follows that the phyB-401 photoreceptor retains a P(fr)-like structure (P(r) (*)) for a few hours after the far-red light treatment.

The function of PHOTOPERIODIC CONTROL OF HYPOCOTYL1 (PCH1) is to stabilise active phyB in nuclear bodies but, surprisingly, warmth reduces PCH1 gene expression and PCH1 stability. When phyB was active at the beginning of the night, warm night temperatures enhanced the levels of nuclear phyB and reduced hypocotyl growth rate during the following day. However, when end-of-day far-red light minimised phyB activity, warm night temperatures reduced the levels of nuclear phyB and enhanced the hypocotyl growth rate during the following day.

This review discusses the uniqueness of phyA in terms of its structural and functional heterogeneity. The photoreceptor is presented in monocots and dicots by two native molecular species, phyA' and phyA'', differing by spectroscopic, photochemical and phenomenological properties. phyA differentiation into substates includes post-translational phosphorylation of a serine residue(s) at the N-terminal extension of the molecule with phyA' being the phosphorylated species and phyA'', dephosphorylated.

The content and functional activity of the two pools are regulated by light and by phosphatase/kinase equilibrium and pH in darkness, what contributes to the fine-tuning of the phytochrome system. Detection of the native pools of the cryptogamic plant fern Adiantum capillus-veneris phy1 (phy1' and phy1'') similar to those of phyA suggests that the structural and functional heterogeneity of phyA is not a unique phenomenon and may have arisen earlier in the molecular evolution of the phytochrome system than the appearance of the angiosperm phytochromes.",0.0

Similar to PIF3, upon light exposure, PIF7 rapidly migrates to intranuclear speckles, where it colocalizes with phyB. However, in striking contrast to PIF3, this process is not accompanied by detectable light-induced phosphorylation or degradation of PIF7, suggesting that the consequences of interaction with photoactivated phyB may differ among PIFs. Nevertheless, PIF7 acts similarly to PIF3 in prolonged red light as a weak negative regulator of phyB-mediated seedling deetiolation. Examination of pif3, pif4, and pif7 double mutant combinations shows that their moderate hypersensitivity to extended red light is additive. We provide evidence that the mechanism by which these PIFs operate on the phyB signaling pathway under prolonged red light is through maintaining low phyB protein levels, in an additive or synergistic manner, via a process likely involving the proteasome pathway.

Presence of the mPHYB transgene in a wild-type genetic background causes exaggeration of this same set of phenotypic characteristics, indicating that these diverse photo-morphogenic responses are sensitive to the copy number of the PHYB gene. The transgene inserts in the Bo64(mPHYB) and WT(mPHYB) lines are shown to be single locus and single copy and the immunologically detectable level of phytochrome B is shown to vary linearly with PHYB gene copy number. These results demonstrate a complex role for phytochrome B in Arabidopsis photo-morphogenesis and suggest that the expression level of this phytochrome gene is an important determinant of the intensity of light-induced plant responses.",0.0

Although crosstalk between light signaling and ER stress response has been reported in plants, the molecular mechanisms underlying this crosstalk are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB) induces the expression of ER luminal protein chaperones as well as that of unfolded protein response (UPR) genes. The phyB-5 mutant was less sensitive to tunicamycin (TM)-induced ER stress than were the wild-type plants, whereas phyB-overexpressing plants displayed a more sensitive phenotype under white light conditions. ER stress response genes (BiP2 and BiP3), UPR-related bZIP transcription factors (bZIP17, bZIP28, and bZIP60), and programmed cell death (PCD)-associated genes (OXI1, NRP1, and MC8) were upregulated in phyB-overexpressing plants, but not in phyB-5, under ER stress conditions. The ER stress-sensitive phenotype of phyB-5 under red light conditions was eliminated with a reduction in photo-equilibrium by far-red light and darkness. The N-terminal domain of phyB is essential for signal transduction of the ER stress response in the nucleus, which is similar to light signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that phyB integrates light signaling with the UPR to relieve ER stress and maintain proper plant growth.",0.0

Comparison of the observed expression patterns with those induced by continuous monochromatic far-red light (FRc; perceived exclusively by phyA) in WT and phyA null-mutant seedlings suggests early convergence of the FRc and Rc photosensory pathways to control a largely common transcriptional network. phyB mutant seedlings retain a surprisingly high level of responsiveness to Rc for the majority of Rc-regulated genes on the microarray, indicating that one or more other phys have a major role in regulating their expression. Combined with the robust visible morphogenic phenotype of the phyB mutant in Rc, these data suggest that different members of the phy family act in organ-specific fashion in regulating seedling de-etiolation. Specifically, phyB appears to be the dominant, if not exclusive, photoreceptor in regulating a minority population of genes involved in suppression of hypocotyl cell elongation in response to Rc signals.

Therefore, as a first step toward determining the molecular genetic basis of photoperiodic ecotypes in trees, we characterized the phytochrome gene (PHY) family in black cottonwood. We recovered fragments of one PHYA and two PHYB using PCR-based cloning and by screening a genomic library. Results from Southern analyses confirmed that black cottonwood has one PHYA locus and two PHYB loci, which we arbitrarily designated PHYB1 and PHYB2. Phylogenetic analyses which included PHY from black cottonwood, Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) suggest that the PHYB/D duplications in these species occurred independently.

This phyA specificity is determined at the level of (i) intramolecular events, (ii) turnover, phyA being light-labile, and (iii) nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning and interaction with partner proteins. A unique feature of phyA is that two native isoforms, phyA' and phyA'', comprise it, distinguished by spectroscopic and photochemical properties, localization and abundance in plant tissues, light stability, and other properties.

PhyA'' interferes with the action of phyA' and this interaction may be part of the fine tuning mechanism of the phyA function. Finally, within the phyA' pool there are different conformers in thermal equilibrium, that differ by the activation and kinetic parameters of the Pr-->lumi-R photoreaction.

698,The Plant cell ,PUBMED: 20118225; ,"A synthesis of insights from functional and evolutionary studies reveals how the phytochrome photoreceptor system has evolved to impart both stability and flexibility. Phytochromes in seed plants diverged into three major forms, phyA, phyB, and phyC, very early in the history of seed plants. Two additional forms, phyE and phyD, are restricted to flowering plants and Brassicaceae, respectively. While phyC, D, and E are absent from at least some taxa, phyA and phyB are present in all sampled seed plants and are the principal mediators of red/far-red-induced responses. Conversely, phyC-E apparently function in concert with phyB and, where present, expand the repertoire of phyB activities. Despite major advances, aspects of the structural-functional models for these photoreceptors remain elusive. Comparative sequence analyses expand the array of locus-specific mutant alleles for analysis by revealing historic mutations that occurred during gene lineage splitting and divergence. With insights from crystallographic data, a subset of these mutants can be chosen for functional studies to test their importance and determine the molecular mechanism by which they might impact light perception and signaling. In the case of gene families, where redundancy hinders isolation of some proportion of the relevant mutants, the approach may be particularly useful.",0.0

This function is crucial for both antiviral immunity and the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. An Ets family transcription factor, i.e., Spi-B (which is highly expressed in pDCs) is required for TLR7/9 signal-induced type I IFN production and can transactivate IFN-α promoter in synergy with IFN regulatory factor-7 (IRF-7). Herein, we analyzed how Spi-B contributes to the transactivation of the Ifna4 promoter. We performed deletion and/or mutational analyses of the Ifna4 promoter and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and observed an Spi-B binding site in close proximity to the IRF-7 binding site. The EMSA results also showed that the binding of Spi-B to the double-stranded DNA probe potentiated the recruitment of IRF-7 to its binding site. We also observed that the association of Spi-B with transcriptional coactivator p300 was required for the Spi-B-induced synergistic enhancement of the Ifna4 promoter activity by Spi-B.

This defect is exacerbated in the presence of Spi-1 haplo-insufficiency (Spi1+/- SpiB-/-). Tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium mobilization induced by BCR engagement is diminished in Spi1+/- SpiB-/- B lymphocytes, although many key BCR signaling proteins are expressed, suggesting that Spi-1 and Spi-B regulate expression of additional, unidentified signaling molecules. We now demonstrate that expression of the adaptor protein Grap2 is impaired in Spi1+/- SpiB+/- and Spi1+/- SpiB-/- B lymphocytes. Analysis of two alternate murine Grap2 promoters revealed a functionally important Spi-1 and Spi-B DNA binding element located in the downstream promoter. Ectopic expression of Grap2 in Grap2-deficient B cells reduced the recruitment of BLNK to Igalpha and the phosphorylation of specific substrates. Regulation of BLNK recruitment was dependent upon the Grap2 proline-rich domain, while modulation of phosphorylation was dependent upon both the proline-rich and SH2 domains. These data indicate that Spi-1 and Spi-B directly regulate the expression of Grap2 and that Grap2 functions to modulate BCR signaling, but that reduced Grap2 expression is unlikely to account for the BCR signaling defects observed in Spi1+/- SpiB-/- B cells.",0.0

First, using retroviral vectors to infect PU.1(-/-) fetal liver progenitors, Spi-C was found to be inefficient at inducing cytokine-dependent proliferation and differentiation of progenitor B (pro-B) cells or macrophages relative to PU.1 or Spi-B. Next, Spi-C was ectopically expressed in fetal liver-derived, IL-7-dependent pro-B cell lines. Wild-type (WT) pro-B cells ectopically expressing Spi-C (WT-Spi-C) have several phenotypic characteristics of pre-B cells such as increased CD25 and decreased c-Kit surface expression. In addition, WT-Spi-C pro-B cells express increased levels of IgH sterile transcripts and reduced levels of expression and transcription of the FcgammaRIIb gene. Gel-shift analysis suggests that Spi-C, ectopically expressed in pro-B cells, can bind PU.1 consensus sites in the IgH intronic enhancer and FcgammaRIIb promoter. Transient transfection analysis demonstrated that PU.1 functions to repress the IgH intronic enhancer and activate the FcgammaRIIb promoter, while Spi-C opposes these activities. WT-Spi-C pro-B cells have reduced levels of dimethylation on lysine 9 of histone H3 within the IgH 3' regulatory region, indicating that Spi-C can contribute to removal of repressive features in the IgH locus.

A subpopulation of the RPV white-pock mutants fail to plaque on pig kidney (PK-15) cells and are referred to as host-range (hr) mutants. In the case of CPV, white-pock formation has been linked to mutations in the SPI-2 (crmA) gene.

Gene activation is facilitated by Spi-1 occupancy close to transcriptional starting site of genes devoid of CGIs. Moreover, in those regions Spi-1 acts by binding to multiple motifs tightly clustered and with similar orientation. Finally, in contrast to the myeloid and lymphoid B cells in which Spi-1 exerts a physiological activity, in the erythroleukemic cells, lineage-specific cooperating factors do not play a prevalent role in Spi-1-mediated transcriptional activation.

We employed Phenotype Microarray (Biolog, USA) to compare the metabolic properties of SPI-13 deficient mutant (ΔSPI-13) and the WT parent strain of non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica sub sp. enterica serovar Enteritidis (S.

The results of Phenotype Microarray revealed that SPI-13 is required for efficient utilization of two micronutrients, namely, d-glucuronic acid (DGA) and tyramine (TYR), as sole sources of carbon and/or nitrogen. By systematic deletion of the individual gene(s), we identified specific genes within SPI-13 that are required for efficient utilization of DGA (SEN2977-80) and TYR (SEN2967 and SEN2971-72) as sole nutrient sources. The results show that SPI-13 mediated DGA and TYR metabolic pathways afford nutritional fitness to S. Enteritidis. Comparative genomics analysis of the SPI-13 locus from 247 Salmonella strains belonging to 57 different serovars revealed that SPI-13 genes specifically involved in the metabolism of DGA and TYR are highly conserved in Salmonella enterica.

Furthermore, we found by transient transfection assays that the -270/-41 region of the Fli-1 gene displays promoter activity which is transactivated by Spi-1/PU.1. This promoter is strictly dependent on the integrity of two highly conserved ETS DNA binding sites that bind the Spi-1/PU.1 protein in vitro.

Induction of APR by turpentine injection includes activation of a STAT3 complex that can bind to a gamma-activated sequence (GAS) in the Spi 2.2 gene promoter, although the Spi 2.2 GAS site can bind STAT1 or STAT5 as well. To create an in vitro model of APR, primary hepatocytes were treated with combinations of cytokines and hormones to mimic the hormonal milieu of the whole animal after APR induction. Incubation of primary rat hepatocytes with interleukin (IL)-6, a critical APR cytokine, leads to activation of STAT3 and a 28-fold induction of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct containing the -319 to +85 region of the Spi 2.2 promoter. This suggests the turpentine-induced increase of Spi 2.2 is mediated primarily by IL-6. In contrast, although turpentine treatment reduces Spi 2.1 mRNA in vivo and IL-6 does not increase Spi 2.1 mRNA in primary rat hepatocytes, treatment of hepatocytes with IL-6 results in a 5. 4-fold induction of Spi 2.1 promoter activity mediated through the paired GAS elements in this promoter.

In contrast, infection by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can strongly activate il1b via the expression of immediate early (IE) viral proteins and eliminates the requirement for the upstream enhancer. Spi-1 has been circumstantially implicated as a host factor in this process. We report here the molecular basis for the direct involvement of Spi-1 in HCMV activation of il1b. Transfection of Spi-1-deficient HeLa cells demonstrated both the requirement of Spi-1 for IE activity and the need for a shorter promoter (-59 to +12) than that required in the absence of IE proteins. Furthermore, in contrast to normal, enhancer-dependent il1b expression, which absolutely requires both the Spi-1 winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA-binding domain and the majority of the Spi-1 TAD, il1b expression in the presence of IE proteins does not require the Spi-1 TAD, which plays a synergistic role. In addition, we demonstrate that a single IE protein, IE2, is critical for the induction of il1b. Protein-protein interaction experiments revealed that the wing motif within the Spi-1 wHTH domain directly recruits IE2. In turn, IE2 physically associates with the Spi-1 wing and requires the integrity of at least one region of IE2. Functional analysis demonstrates that both this region and a carboxy-terminal acidic TAD are required for IE2 function.

JCV infection is regulated through binding of host factors such as Spi-B to, and sequence variation in the non-coding control region (NCCR). Although NCCR sequences differ between sites of persistence and pathogenesis, evidence suggests that the virus that initiates infection in the brain disseminates via B-cells derived from latently infected haematopoietic precursors in the bone marrow. Spi-B binds adjacent to TATA boxes in the promoter/enhancer of the PML-associated JCV Mad-1 and Mad-4 viruses but not the non-pathogenic, kidney-associated archetype.

Strikingly, the reverse mutation in the archetype NCCR increased large T-antigen expression by 10-fold. Interestingly, Spi-B protein binds the NCCR sequence flanking the viral promoter/enhancer, but these sites are not essential for early viral gene expression.

Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) harbours the genes required for the stimulation of Salmonella uptake across the intestinal epithelia of the infected host. Regulation of SPI-1 genes is complex, as invasion gene expression responds to a number of different signals, presumably signals similar to those found within the environment of the intestinal tract. As a result of our continued studies of SPI-1 gene regulation, we have discovered that the nucleoid-binding protein Fis plays a pivotal role in the expression of HilA and InvF, two activators of SPI-1 genes. A S. typhimurium fis mutant demonstrates a two- to threefold reduction in hilA:Tn5lacZY and a 10-fold reduction in invF:Tn5lacZY expression, as well as a 50-fold decreased ability to invade HEp-2 tissue culture cells.

A double point mutation at a putative STAT binding site, which overlaps this composite Spi-1 x IRF8 site located in the LPS and IL-1 response element (LILRE), inhibited human IL1B LPS-dependent reporter activity to about 10 percent of the control wild type vector. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed stimulation-independent constitutive binding of IRF8, Spi-1 and NTP-Stat1 at the LILRE, while binding of C/EBP beta was activated at an adjacent C/EBP beta site after LPS stimulation. In contrast to Stat1, IRF8 was tyrosine phosphorylated following LPS treatment. Supporting the involvement of NTP-Stat1, LPS-induced IL1B reporter activity in monocytes was enhanced by ectopic expression of NTP-Stat1 Y701F. In contrast, co-expression of a Y211F IRF8 mutein functioned as a dominant-negative inhibitor of LPS-induced IL1B reporter activity. In vitro DNA binding using extracts from LPS-treated monocytes confirmed that the LILRE enhancer constitutively binds a trimolecular complex containing IRF8, Spi-1 and NTP-Stat1. Binding studies using in vitro-expressed proteins revealed that NTP-Stat1 enhanced the binding of Spi-1 and IRF8 to the LILRE. Co-expression of TRAF6, an LPS surrogate, with Spi-1 and IRF8 enhanced IL1B reporter activity in HEK293R cells, which was dramatically reduced when Y211F IRF8 was co-expressed. These results suggest that the rapid transcriptional induction of an important inflammatory gene is dependent upon constitutive cooperative binding of a Spi-1 x IRF8 x NTP-Stat1 complex to the LILRE, which primes the gene for immediate induction following IRF8 phosphorylation.

Using transient transfection assays of a series of human GPIIb promoter fragments, we delineated a TPO-responsive element within the previously reported enhancer region of the promoter. Although this enhancer included GATA- and Ets-binding sites (EBSs), we found that only EBS -514 was important for TPO response. We identified PU. 1/Spi-1 as the endogenous Ets transcription factor that strongly and preferentially interacted with this enhancer EBS. This factor did not interact with other proximal EBSs in the GPIIb promoter. We next showed that TPO induced a strong and selective increase of PU. 1/Spi-1 expression and DNA binding activity in UT7-Mpl cells. In contrast, TPO did not affect the expression of Ets-1/2 while weakly increasing the levels of Fli-1. Overexpression of PU.1/Spi-1 was further shown to enhance GPIIb promoter activity in the absence and presence of TPO.

Deregulated expression of each of these three oncogenes has been independently shown to contribute to cell proliferation of erythroleukemic clones. Previous studies showed a close relationship between Spi-1 and Fli-1, which belong to the same ETS family, Spi-1 activating fli-1 gene, and both Spi-1 and Fli-1 activating multiple common target genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. In this study, we demonstrated that Spi-1 and Fli-1 are also involved in direct miR-17-92 transcriptional activation through their binding to a conserved ETS binding site in its promoter. Moreover, we demonstrated that physiological re-expression of exogenous miR-17 and miR-20a are able to partially rescue the proliferation loss induced by Fli-1 knock-down and identified HBP1 as a target of these miRNA in erythroleukemic cells.

723,The Journal of general virology ,PUBMED: 20826618; ,"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an often fatal demyelinating disease caused by lytic infection of oligodendrocytes with JC virus (JCV). The development of PML in non-immunosuppressed individuals is a growing concern with reports of mortality in patients treated with mAb therapies. JCV can persist in the kidneys, lymphoid tissue and bone marrow. JCV gene expression is restricted by non-coding viral regulatory region sequence variation and cellular transcription factors. Because JCV latency has been associated with cells undergoing haematopoietic development, transcription factors previously reported as lymphoid specific may regulate JCV gene expression. This study demonstrates that one such transcription factor, Spi-B, binds to sequences present in the JCV promoter/enhancer and may affect early virus gene expression in cells obtained from human brain tissue. We identified four potential Spi-B-binding sites present in the promoter/enhancer elements of JCV sequences from PML variants and the non-pathogenic archetype. Spi-B sites present in the promoter/enhancers of PML variants alone bound protein expressed in JCV susceptible brain and lymphoid-derived cell lines by electromobility shift assays. Expression of exogenous Spi-B in semi- and non-permissive cells increased early viral gene expression. Strikingly, mutation of the Spi-B core in a binding site unique to the Mad-4 variant was sufficient to abrogate viral activity in progenitor-derived astrocytes. These results suggest that Spi-B could regulate JCV gene expression in susceptible cells, and may play an important role in JCV activity in the immune and nervous systems.",0.0

SPI-3 harbors 10 open reading frames organized in six transcriptional units, which include the previously described mgtCB operon encoding the macrophage survival protein MgtC and the Mg2+ transporter MgtB. Among the newly identified open reading frames, one exhibits sequence similarity to the ToxR regulatory protein of Vibrio cholerae and one is similar to the AIDA-I adhesin of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli.

This response is poorly understood and difficult to reconcile with the view that H-NS acts mainly by blocking transcription initiation. Here we have analyzed the basis for the up-regulation of H-NS-silenced Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) in cells depleted of Rho-cofactor NusG. Evidence from genetic experiments, semiquantitative 5' rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends sequencing (5' RACE-Seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) shows that transcription originating from spurious antisense promoters, when not stopped by Rho, elongates into a H-NS-bound regulatory region of SPI-1, displacing H-NS and rendering the DNA accessible to the master regulator HilD. In turn, HilD's ability to activate its own transcription triggers a positive feedback loop that results in transcriptional activation of the entire SPI-1. Significantly, single-cell analyses revealed that this mechanism is largely responsible for the coexistence of two subpopulations of cells that either express or do not express SPI-1 genes. We propose that cell-to-cell differences produced by stochastic spurious transcription, combined with feedback loops that perpetuate the activated state, can generate bimodal gene expression patterns in bacterial populations.",0.0

Examination of nonpermissive human A549 cells infected with an RPV mutant disrupted in the SPI-1 gene (RPV delta SPI-1) suggests there are no gross defects in protein or DNA synthesis. The proteolytic processing of late viral structural proteins, a feature of orthopoxvirus infections associated with the maturation of virus particles, also appears relatively normal. However, very few mature virus particles of any kind are produced compared with the level found in infections with wild-type RPV. Morphological examination of RPV delta SPI-1-infected A549 cells, together with an observed fragmentation of cellular DNA, suggests that the host range defect is associated with the onset of apoptosis. Apoptosis is seen only in RPV delta SPI-1 infection of nonpermissive (A549 or PK-15) cells and is absent in all wild-type RPV infections and RPV delta SPI-2 mutant infections examined to date. Although the SPI-1 gene is expressed early, before DNA replication, the triggering apoptotic event occurs late in the infection, as RPV delta SPI-1-infected A549 cells do not undergo apoptosis when infections are carried out in the presence of cytosine arabinoside.

Deletion of open reading frames (ORFs) K2, K3, and K4 within the HindIII K fragment of the HA-positive (HA+) vaccinia virus strain WR also led to fusion of cells upon infection at neutral pH. A novel ORF inactivation procedure utilizing the polymerase chain reaction was used to specifically implicate the K2 ORF in this phenomenon. The K2 ORF (the viral SPI-3 gene) encodes a protein resembling serine protease inhibitors (serpins). Inactivation of the SPI-3 gene in any of the HA+ orthopoxviruses tested caused infected cells to fuse in a manner which appeared identical to that seen for HA- mutants, although fusion was most pronounced with cowpox virus. SPI-3-negative strains fused despite the fact that the HA was expressed and processed normally, i.e., cells infected with SPI-3 mutants remained functionally hemadsorption positive, and analysis of the HA protein by Western immunoblot suggested that posttranslational modifications of the HA protein appeared normal. Fusion triggered by SPI-3 mutants, like that for HA- mutants, was inhibited by the monoclonal antibody C3 directed against the vaccinia virus 14-kDa envelope protein.

Beneficial use of horizontally acquired genes requires that their expression is effectively coordinated with the already existing virulence programs and the regulatory set-up in the bacterium.

The ability of this pathogen to survive stress inside and outside the host, such as encountering antimicrobial peptides and heat stress, determines the efficiency of enteric infection. These stressors concertedly trigger virulence factors encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs). Although RpoS is a well-known central transcriptional stress and virulence regulator, functional information regarding the genes of the regulon is currently limited. Here, we identified SEN1538 as a conserved RpoS-regulated gene belonging to the KGG protein superfamily. We further assessed its role in pathogenic stress responses and virulence. When SEN1538 was deleted (Δ1538), the pathogen showed reduced survival during antimicrobial peptide introduction and heat stress at 55°C compared to WT. The mutant displayed 70% reduced invasion in the HCT116 colon epithelial cell line, 5-fold attenuated phagocytic survival in RAW264.7 cells, and downregulation of several SPI-1 and SPI-2 genes encoding the three secretion system apparatus and effector proteins. Δ1538 also showed decreased virulence compared to WT, demonstrated by its reduced bacterial counts in the feces, mLN, spleen, and cecum of C57BL/6 mice. Comparative transcriptomic analysis of Δ1538 against WT revealed 111 differentially regulated genes, 103 of which were downregulated (fold change ≤ -1.5, P < 0.05). The majority of these genes were in clusters for metabolism, transporters, and pathogenesis, driving pathogenic stress responses and virulence. SEN1538 is, therefore, an important virulence determinant contributing to the resilience of S. Enteritidis to stress factors during infection.",0.0

Despite the fact that the LuxS/autoinducer-2 (AI-2) QS system is necessary for normal expression of Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 (SPI-1), the mechanism remains unknown. Here, we report that the LsrR protein, a transcriptional regulator known to be involved in LuxS/AI-2-mediated QS, is also associated with the regulation of SPI-1-mediated Salmonella virulence. We determined that LsrR negatively controls SPI-1 and flagella gene expressions. As phosphorylated AI-2 binds to and inactivates LsrR, LsrR remains active and decreases expression of SPI-1 and flagella genes in the luxS mutant. The reduced expression of those genes resulted in impaired invasion of Salmonella into epithelial cells. Expression of SPI-1 and flagella genes was also reduced by overexpression of the LsrR regulator from a plasmid, but was relieved by exogenous AI-2, which binds to and inactivates LsrR. These results imply that LsrR plays an important role in selecting infectious niche of Salmonella in QS dependent mode.",0.0

ΔSEN1005 displayed significantly reduced entry into cultured epithelial cells as well as uptake by macrophages and failed to cause acute colitis in C57BL/6 mice at day 3 post-infection (p.i.). Additionally, the global transcriptome analysis revealed a highly repressed SPI-1 and other down-regulated genes responsible for flagellar assembly, chemotaxis and motility in the mutant which correlated with decreased invasion and abated inflammation as compared to the wild-type.

In direct contrast to PU.1(-/-) mice that die in utero and lack monocytes, neutrophils, B cells, and T cells, Spi-B-/- mice are viable and exhibit a severe B cell proliferation defect. Since PU.1 is expressed at wild type levels in Spi-B-/- B cells, the mutant mice provide genetic evidence that SPI-B and PU.1 have at least some non-redundant roles in B lymphocytes. To begin to understand the molecular basis for these defects, we delineated functional domains of SPI-B for comparison to those of PU.1. By using a heterologous co-transfection system, we identified two independent transactivation domains in the N terminus of SPI-B. Interestingly, only one of these domains (amino acids 31-61), a proline/serine/threonine-rich region, unique among Ets proteins, is necessary for transactivation of the immunoglobulin lambda light chain enhancer. This transactivation motif is in marked contrast to PU.1, which contains acidic and glutamine-rich domains. In addition, we describe a functional PU.1 site within the c-FES promoter which SPI-B fails to bind efficiently and transactivate. Finally, we show that SPI-B interacts with the PU.1 cofactors Pip, TBP, c-Jun and with lower affinity to nuclear factor interleukin-6beta and retinoblastoma. Taken together, these data suggest that SPI-B binds DNA with a different affinity for certain sites than PU.1 and harbors different transactivation domains. We conclude that SPI-B may activate unique target genes in B lymphocytes and interact with unique, although currently unidentified, cofactors.",0.0

While these results suggest that alterations in Spi-1 expression have significant effects on erythroblast growth and differentiation, neither the cause nor the effect of the decrease in Spi-1 expression that follows Me2SO exposure has been established. The experiments described here demonstrate that the effect of inducers on Spi-1 expression is regulated post-transcriptionally. Nuclear run-off transcriptions demonstrated that Spi-1 transcription was not decreased following Me2SO exposure. Additionally, expression of a recombinant Spi-1 mRNA under transcriptional control of a constitutively active Rous sarcoma virus promoter was regulated identically to endogenous Spi-1 mRNA. The ability of Me2SO to destabilize Spi-1 mRNA was selective, as the stability of the erythroid transcription factors GATA-1 and NF-E2 were not similarly effected.

A major difference between these two otherwise very similar genes is the presence in spi 2.3 of a specific 348-bp extension of the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR). Inserting this 3' UTR element downstream of the polyadenylation signal or upstream of the spi 2.3 promoter in constructs containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene strongly decreases basal transcription and inhibits growth-hormone-stimulated transcription, but poorly affects transcriptional stimulation by dexamethasone or interleukin-6. The spi 2.3 3' UTR extension also inhibits, basal and growth-hormone-induced transcription from the spi 2.1 promoter. Repressor activity appears to be distributed throughout the specific extension of the 3' UTR and seems to involve interactions with two types of 5' cis-acting promoter elements. The first is the GAGA box, a key control spi promoter element, whose mutation faithfully reproduces the effects of the 3' UTR silencer on spi 2.1 and spi 2.3 promoters. The second is represented by CCAAT enhancer-binding-protein-(C/EBP)-binding sites, whose functions are severely impaired by the spi 2.3-specific 3' UTR extension.

PU.1 is completely absent from peripheral T cells and most T cell lines based on sensitive RT-PCR assays. In contrast, Spi-B is expressed exclusively in lymphoid cells and can be detected in early fetal thymus and spleen.

Spi-B expression is very abundant in B cells and both Spi-B mRNA and protein are detected in some T cells. In situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis suggest that Spi-B gene expression increases during B cell maturation and decreases during T cell maturation.

To date, we have only found evidence for involvement of C/EBP alpha, although further experiments will be needed to exclude the role of C/EBP beta and C/EBP delta in receptor gene expression. These studies suggest a model of hematopoiesis (Fig. 2) in which the lineage commitment decisions of multipotential cells are made by the alternative patterns of expression of certain transcription factors, which then activate growth factor receptors which allow those cells to respond to the appropriate growth factor to proliferate and survive. For example, expression of GATA-1 activates its own expression, as well as that of the erythropoietin receptor, inducing these cells to be capable of responding to erythropoietin. Similarly, expression of PU.1 activates its own promoter, and turns on the three myeloid CSF receptors (M, GM, and G), pushing these cells along the pathway of myeloid differentiation. C/EBP proteins, particularly C/EBP alpha, are also critical for myeloid receptor promoter function, and may also act via autoregulatory mechanisms. Murine C/EBP alpha has a C/EBP binding site in its own promoter. Human C/EBP alpha autoregulates its own expression in adipocytes by activating the USF transcription factor. Myeloid genes expressed later during differentiation, such as CD11b, are also activated by PU.1, which is expressed at highest levels in mature myeloid cells, but not by C/EBP alpha, which is downregulated in a differentiated murine myeloid cell line. Consistent with this model are the findings that overexpression of PU.1 in erythroid cells blocks erythroid differentiation, leading to erythroleukemia, and overexpression of GATA-1 in a myeloid line blocks myeloid differentiation. While these findings have provided some framework for understanding myeloid gene regulation, there are a number of critical questions to be addressed in the near future: What is the pattern of expression of the C/EBP proteins during the course of myeloid differentiation and activation of human CD34+ cells? What is the effect of targeted disruption and other mutations of the C/EBP and AML1 proteins on myeloid development and receptor expression?

Recent evidence also suggests that variation in the regulatory elements of these genes and their downstream targets underlies the evolution of several segment-specific morphological traits. This review introduces a new model system, the larval oenocyte, for studying the evolution of fate specification by Hox genes at single-cell resolution. Oenocytes are found in a wide range of insects, including species using both the short and the long germ modes of development. Recent progress in our understanding of the genetics and cell biology of oenocyte development in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster is discussed. In the D. melanogaster embryo, the formation of this cell type is restricted to the first 7 abdominal segments and is under Hox gene control. Oenocytes delaminate from the dorsal ectoderm of A1-A7 in response to an induction that involves the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling pathway. Although the receptor itself is required in the presumptive oenocytes, its ligand Spitz (Spi) is secreted by a neighbouring chordotonal organ precursor (COP). Thus, in dorsal regions, local signalling from this component of the developing peripheral nervous system induces the formation of oenocytes. In contrast, in lateral regions of the ectoderm, Spi signal from a different COP induces the formation of secondary COPs in a homeogenetic manner. This dorsoventral difference in the fate induced by Spi ligand is controlled by a prepattern in the responding ectoderm that requires the Spalt (Sal) transcription factor. Sal protein is expressed in the dorsal but not lateral ectoderm and acts as a competence modifier to bias the response to Spi ligand in favour of the oenocyte fate. We discuss a recently proposed model that integrates the roles of Sal and the EGFR pathway in oenocyte/chordotonal organ induction. This model should provide a useful starting point for future comparative studies of these ectodermal derivatives in other insects.",0.0

Moreover, Tax synergized with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce the IL1B promoter activity. Analyses of specific nucleotide substitutions further indicated that the Tax-induced transcriptional activation requires two transcription factor binding motifs within the IL1B promoter; one is a binding site for nuclear factor (NF)-IL6 (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta, C/EBP beta), which belongs to the basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) family and the other for Spi-1 (PU.1), which is an Ets family protein found principally in monocytes, macrophages, and B lymphocytes. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using in vivo THP-1 nuclear extracts, Tax expression in THP-1 monocytic cells significantly increased binding of the two factors to their target IL1B promoter sequences. However, in contrast to NF-IL6 and Spi-1, DNA binding activity of Oct-1, an ubiquitously expressed octamer-binding protein was not affected by Tax. Additional EMSA using in vitro translated proteins also showed that recombinant Tax enhances DNA binding of both of recombinant NF-IL6 and Spi-1 proteins. These data were supported by our glutathione S-transferase (GST)-pull-down data, which indicated that Tax physically interacts with the two proteins. Based on the results obtained from the present study, we conclude that the IL1B promoter is a Tax-responsive sequence as a result of ability of Tax to induce binding of NF-IL6 and Spi-1 to the IL1B promoter sequence through protein-protein interaction.",0.0

Rabbitpox virus (RPV) mutants with deletions of the SPI-1 gene grow on monkey kidney cells (CV-1) but do not plaque on normally permissive human lung carcinoma cells (A549). This reduced-host-range (hr) phenotype suggests that SPI-1 may interact with cellular and/or other viral proteins. We devised a genetic screen for suppressors of SPI-1 hr mutations by first introducing a mutation into SPI-1 (T309R) at residue P14 of the serpin reactive center loop. The SPI-1 T309R serpin is inactive as a protease inhibitor in vitro. Introduction of the mutation into RPV leads to the same restricted hr phenotype as deletion of the SPI-1 gene. Second-site suppressors were selected by restoration of growth of the RPV SPI-1 T309R hr mutant on A549 cells. Both intragenic and extragenic suppressors of the T309R mutation were identified. One novel intragenic suppressor mutation, T309C, restored protease inhibition by SPI-1 in vitro. Extragenic suppressor mutations were mapped by a new procedure utilizing overlapping PCR products encompassing the entire genome in conjunction with marker rescue. One suppressor mutation, which also rendered the virus temperature sensitive for growth, mapped to the DNA polymerase gene (E9L). Several other suppressors mapped to gene D5R, an NTPase required for DNA replication.

In this report, using combined RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq technologies, we first identified 1646 Fis-regulated genes and 885 Fis-binding targets in the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, and found a Fis regulon different from that in E. coli.

Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPI)-1 and SPI-2 are crucial for the invasion and survival of S. enterica in host cells. Using mutation and overexpression experiments, real-time PCR analysis, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrated that Fis regulates 63 of the 94 Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-1 and SPI-2 genes, by three regulatory modes: i) binds to SPI regulators in the gene body or in upstream regions; ii) binds to SPI genes directly to mediate transcriptional activation of themselves and downstream genes; iii) binds to gene encoding OmpR which affects SPI gene expression by controlling SPI regulators SsrA and HilD.

Nevertheless, the rewired strain grew at a similar rate to the wild-type and was similar in competitive fitness. However, compared to the wild-type, it was less motile, had growth-phase-specific reductions in SPI-1 and SPI-2 gene expression, and was engulfed at a higher rate by RAW macrophage.

Here, we report that PU.1 mRNA is upregulated during myeloid differentiation of human purified CD34+ cells and murine multipotential FDCP-mix A4 cells, suggesting that PU.1 is upregulated as an early event during differentiation of multipotential progenitor cells.

In vitro translated Spi-B protein can bind to PU.1 binding sites in myeloid promoters and transactivate these promoters in nonmyeloid cells. Therefore, although PU.1 and Spi-B may bind to similar DNA control elements and have redundancy of transactivation function in vitro, the lack of significant levels of Spi-B in myeloid cells makes it unlikely that Spi-B plays a significant role in myeloid lineage development and gene expression.

Here, we show a positive feedback loop that couples constitutive phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling to high expression of Spi-1/PU.1 in Friend erythroleukemia cells. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT results in Spi-1/PU.1 downregulation in a stepwise manner and induces cell differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further supported the positive autoregulatory effect of Spi-1/PU.1. Mutational analysis indicated that Ser41, but not Ser148, is necessary for Spi-1/PU.1-mediated repression of hemoglobin expression, whereas both Ser residues are required for Spi-1/PU.1 inhibition of the erythroid splicing event. We further show that inhibition of the erythroid transcriptional and splicing events are strictly dependent on distinct Spi-1/PU.1 phosphorylation modifications rather than Spi-1/PU.1 expression level per se.

One of several cell types on which RPV(ps/hr) mutants fail to produce plaques is chicken embryo fibroblasts, cells which have been traditionally used to propagate spontaneously arising white pock mutants isolated from CAMs. The inability of the RPV(ps/hr) mutant to form plaques in chicken embryo fibroblasts correlates with a failure of a low multiplicity of infection to spread to neighboring cells and to form extracellular enveloped virus (EEV), although the formation and yields of infectious intracellular naked virus appear relatively normal.

While the role of Spi-1 in the transcriptional regulation of B cell and myeloid specific genes has been largely demonstrated, the biological function of Spi-B still remains to be elucidated. Since Spi-B and Spi-1 are very divergent in their transactivator domain, these domains might acquire functional specificity in vivo by interacting with different co-factors and/or by undergoing different phosphorylations. First, we observed that casein kinase II phosphorylates Spi-B as well as Spi-1, in vitro. Then, by affinity chromatographies and in vitro kinase assays with fusion proteins between glutathione-S-transferase and the transactivator domain of Spi-B, two kinases were identified on their ability to interact and phosphorylate this domain; the MAP kinase ERK1 and the stress activated protein kinase JNK1. The Threonine 56 was defined as the ERK1 phosphorylation site by using phosphoamino-acid analyses and a Spi-B mutant version with the substitution T56 to A56. Strikingly, ERK1 failed to phosphorylate Spi-1, in vitro, whereas JNK1, like CK II, phosphorylated Spi-B and Spi-1. In addition, other purified Spi-B-kinase activities, unidentified as yet, display similar specificity than ERK1 for Spi-B versus Spi-1. Furthermore, the evident interaction of pRb protein with the transactivator domain of Spi-B in an unphosphorylated state disappeared when this domain was first phosphorylated in vitro either by ERK1 or by the purified Spi-B-kinase activities. Our data revealed multiple phosphorylation sites within Spi-B whose some of them appeared specific for Spi-B versus Spi-1 and which may account for differential regulation of their activities.",0.0

As cells decide against the last alternative options to the T-cell fate, they turn on the transcription factor Bcl11b and silence expression of a group of multipotent progenitor regulatory factors that include hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1. Functional perturbation tests show that Bcl11b is needed for commitment while PU.1 actively participates in keeping open access to alternative fates, until it is silenced; however, PU.1 and Bcl11b both contribute positively to T-cell development. Our recent work reviewed here sheds light on the transcriptional regulatory network that determines the timing and irreversibility of Bcl11b activation, the ways that Notch signaling from the thymic microenvironment restricts the action of PU.1 to prevent it from diverting cells to non-T fates, and the target genes that PU.1 still regulates under the influence of Notch signaling to contribute to T-cell generation. We argue that T-cell development depends on the sequential operation of two interlaced, but mutually antagonistic, gene regulatory networks, one initially supporting expansion before commitment and the other imposing a ""terminal"" differentiation process on committed cells.",0.0

When NIH-3T3 cells ectopically expressing ADD1 are cultured under hormonal conditions not favoring differentiation, they do not overtly differentiate but still activate expression of mRNAs for fatty acid synthase (FAS) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), two key genes that regulate fatty acid metabolism. Under culture conditions permissive for differentiation including a PPAR activator, 15%-20% of the cells expressing ADD1 undergo adipogenesis while 2%-3% of cells containing a control vector differentiate. Simultaneous expression of ADD1 with PPARgamma increases the transcriptional activity of this adipogenic nuclear hormone receptor, suggesting involvement of ADD1 in this pathway.

This elevation of ADD1/SREBP1, leptin, and FAS that is induced by feeding in vivo is mimicked by exposure of cultured adipocytes to insulin, the classic hormone of the fed state. We also show that the promoters for both leptin and FAS are transactivated by ADD1/SREBP1. A mutation in the basic domain of ADD1/SREBP1 that allows E-box binding but destroys sterol regulatory element-1 binding prevents leptin gene transactivation but has no effect on the increase in FAS promoter function. Molecular dissection of the FAS promoter shows that most if not all of this action of ADD1/SREBP1 is through an E-box motif at -64 to -59, contained with a sequence identified previously as the major insulin response element of this gene.

Because insulin stimulates carbohydrate and lipid synthesis, it would be important to decipher how the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c is regulated in the insulin signaling pathway. In this study, we demonstrated that glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c. GSK3 inhibitors enhanced a transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c and expression of ADD1/SREBP1c target genes including fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and steroyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) in adipocytes and hepatocytes. In contrast, overexpression of GSK3beta down-regulated the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c. GSK3 inhibitor-mediated ADD1/SREBP1c target gene activation did not require de novo protein synthesis, implying that GSK3 might affect transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c at the level of post-translational modification. Additionally, we demonstrated that GSK3 efficiently phosphorylated ADD1/SREBP1c in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, these data suggest that GSK3 inactivation is crucial to confer stimulated transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c for insulin-dependent gene expression, which would coordinate lipid and glucose metabolism.",0.0

A total of 150 EH patients and 100 aged- and gender-matched controls were investigated. DNA methylation levels of five cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides on ADD1 promoter were measured employing bisulfite pyrosequencing technology. Our results showed that females have a higher ADD1 DNA methylation than males and a significantly lower CpG1 methylation level is associated with increased risk of EH among them. As for males, a significant association between lower CpG2-5 methylation levels and increased risk of EH was shown. In addition, CpG2-5 methylation was found to be a highly significant predictor for EH among males. In females, CpG1 methylation was considered a predictor of hypertension. No significant correlations were found with biochemical measures, apart from the concentration of aspartate aminotransferase which was inversely correlated with ADD1 CpG2-5 methylation levels among female controls (r = -0.703). These findings highlight that ADD1 methylation may have a contributing role in the pathogenesis of EH with varying implications for both genders.",0.0

The angiotensinogen gene (AGT) is a thrifty gene which increases the risk for common disease with growth of civilization via sodium and body fluid retention. The CC genotype of the AGT/T+31C polymorphism, which is in complete linkage disequilibrium with the TT genotype of the M235T polymorphism, was associated with a decrease of blood pressure decline at night in the Ohasama Study. On the other hand, the Gly460Trp genotype of the alpha-adducin gene (ADD1) is associated with erythrocyte sodium transport and increases tubular sodium reabsorption and risk for hypertension. We also revealed in the Ohasama Study that the Trp460 allele of ADD1 is associated with hypertension in young subjects with low renin activity. In addition to these polymorphisms, the T(-344)C polymorphism in the promoter of the aldosterone synthase gene (CYP11B2) and the C825T polymorphism of the G-protein beta3 subunit gene (GNB3) are considered candidates for the genetic risk of salt-sensitive hypertension.

ADD1 mRNA is expressed predominantly in brown adipose tissue in vivo and is regulated during both determination and differentiation of cultured adipocyte cell lines. ADD1 can function as a sequence-specific transcriptional activator in that it stimulates expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase vector containing multiple ADD1 binding sequences but is unable to activate the myosin light-chain enhancer, which contains multiple binding sites for another bHLH factor, MyoD. ADD1 can also activate transcription through a binding site present in the 5'-flanking region of the fatty acid synthetase gene which is expressed in a differentiation-dependent manner in adipose cells.

To identify cellular proteins that associate with ADD1/SREBP1c, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system with an adipocyte cDNA library. Using the N-terminal domain of ADD1/SREBP1c as bait, we identified Twist2 (also known as Dermo-1), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein, as a novel ADD1/SREBP1c interacting protein. Over-expression of Twist2 strongly repressed the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c, primarily by reducing its binding to target sequences. Inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity with HDAC inhibitors relieved this repression.

Gel mobility-shift assays performed with in vitro-translated ADD1, Id2 or Id3 proteins and a fatty acid synthase (FAS) promoter oligonucleotide showed evidence for a marked inhibition of the formation of DNA-ADD1 complexes by Id2 or Id3 proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation studies using in vitro-translated proteins demonstrated further the physical interaction of Id and ADD1/SREBP-1c proteins in the absence of DNA. Using the FAS gene as a model of an ADD1-regulated promoter in transiently transfected isolated rat adipocytes or mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, a potent inhibition of the activity of the FAS-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene was observed by overexpression of Id2 or Id3. Reciprocally, co-transfection of Id3 antisense and ADD1 expression vectors in preadipocytes potentiated the ADD1/SREBP-1c effect on the FAS promoter activity. Finally, in the non adipogenic NIH-3T3 cell line, most of the ADD1-mediated trans-activation of the FAS promoter was counteracted by co-transfection of Id2 or Id3 expression vectors. Previous studies have indicated Id gene expression to be down-regulated during adipogenesis [Moldes, Lasnier, Fève, Pairault and Djian (1997) Mol. Cell. Biol. 17, 1796-1804].

In osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, the level of the ADD1 mRNA expression was low at the early period of cultures while it subsequently increased with time up to more than 10-fold in the later period of cultures along with the expression of alkaline phosphatase, a differentiation marker of these cells. In ROS17/2.8 cells, which represent mature osteoblasts, ADD1 mRNA was expressed constitutively. Treatment with retinoic acid (RA) enhanced the ADD1 mRNA expression several fold in these cells within 4 h in a dose-dependent manner. This RA effect on the ADD1 mRNA expression was blocked by dichloro-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole but not by cycloheximide. RA treatment did not affect the ADD1 mRNA stability, suggesting the involvement of transcriptional control. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that proteins in the crude nuclear extracts prepared from ROS17/2.8 cells were bound to the E box-containing ADD1 recognition DNA sequence, E/C, and that this binding activity was enhanced by the RA treatment. Neither the E2A protein recognition sequence nor the Myo-D/E12 recognition sequence competed against the E/C sequence for the binding, indicating the sequence specificity of the binding activity. Furthermore, RA treatment enhanced the transactivation activity of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct containing the E/C sequence in the transient transfection assay in ROS17/2.8 cells. RA treatment also enhanced the ADD1 mRNA expression in another rat calvaria-derived cell line, RCT1, and in the primary cultures of newborn rat calvaria cells. Overexpression of ADD1 in ROS17/2.8 enhanced the level of the osteocalcin mRNA expression.

Analysis of genetic variation has the potential to improve our understanding of determinants of antihypertensive drug response in order to individualize drug selection. Genetic variation can influence both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms underlying variation in drug response. Classic pharmacogenetic investigations have identified variations in single genes that have a large effect on antihypertensive drug metabolism and are inherited in a Mendelian fashion. These include a polymorphism in the CYP2D6 gene, encoding a cytochrome p450 family member involved in phase I drug metabolism, and polymorphisms in genes encoding enzymes involved in phase II drug metabolism, including N-acetyltransferase (NAT2), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and phenol sulfotransferase (P-PST, SULT1A1). Although these polymorphisms have major effects on the pharmacokinetic profiles of both commonly used antihypertensive drugs such as metoprolol (CYP2D6), and lesser used drugs such as hydralazine (NAT2), methyldopa (COMT), and minoxidil (SULT1A1), they have not been shown to influence variation in the antihypertensive effect of these drugs at conventional doses. Interest is now focused on identifying genetic polymorphisms that influence the pharmacodynamic determinants of antihypertensive response. Using a candidate gene approach, such polymorphisms have been identified in genes encoding alpha-adducin (ADD1), subunits of G-proteins (GNB3 and GNAS1), the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3), and components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (angiotensinogen [AGT], angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE], the angiotensin type I receptor [AGTR1], and aldosterone synthase [CYP11B2]). These polymorphisms have been shown to influence the BP response to diuretics (ADD1, GNB3, NOS3, and ACE), beta-blockers (GNAS1 and ADRB1), ACE inhibitors (AGT, ACE, and AGTR1), angiotensin receptor blockers (ACE and CYP11B2), and clonidine (GNB3).An emerging consensus from these studies is that single gene effects on antihypertensive drug responses are small, and even the combined effects of all presently known polymorphisms do not account for enough variation in response to be clinically useful. New genome-wide scanning techniques may lead to the identification of genes previously unsuspected of influencing drug response. Additional requirements for pharmacogenetic approaches to become clinically useful are the characterization of the effects of haplotypes and multi-locus genotypes on drug response, and consideration of gene-by-environment interactions. Such studies will require huge sample sizes and novel statistical methods, but the theoretical and technical framework is in place to make this possible.",0.0

We found that (1) the gene for ADD1/SREBP-1c maps to a region of rat Chromosome 10 previously reported to contain a quantitative trait locus involved in the regulation of hepatic cholesterol levels and (2) the SHR harbors a valine-to-methionine substitution in the COOH terminal portion of the ADD1/SREBP-1 protein that is not present in 44 other strains of laboratory rats. These findings, together with previous studies showing that transgenic expression of SREBP-1 isoforms has major effects on hepatic fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, suggest that naturally occurring variation in the gene encoding the SREBP-1 isoforms might contribute to inherited variation in lipid metabolism in the SHR versus other strains of rats.

Progesterone exerts lipogenic effects on adipocytes, and FAS is highly induced in breast tumor cell lines upon progesterone treatment. We show here that progesterone up-regulates ADD1/SREBP1c expression in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line and the primary cultured preadipocyte from rat parametrial adipose tissue. In MCF7, progesterone induced ADD1/SREBP1c and Metallothionein II (a well known progesterone-regulated gene) mRNAs, with comparable potency. In preadipocytes, progesterone increased ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA dose-dependently, but not SREBP1a or SREBP2. Run-on experiments demonstrated that progesterone action on ADD1/SREBP1c was primarily at the transcriptional level. The membrane-bound and mature nuclear forms of ADD1/SREBP1 protein accumulated in preadipocytes cultured with progesterone, and FAS induction could be abolished by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a dominant negative form of ADD1/SREBP1 in these cells. Finally, in the presence of insulin, progesterone was unable to up-regulate ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA in preadipocytes, whereas its effect was restored after 24 h of insulin deprivation. Together these results demonstrate that ADD1/SREBP1c is controlled by progesterone, which, like insulin, acts by increasing ADD1/SREBP1c gene transcription.

The present study aimed to identify the transcriptional factors acting on this target region. First, functional analysis of mutated FAS promoter constructs in transiently transfected lean and obese rat adipocytes showed that the activity of the obesity-related region relied on the presence of a transcriptionally inactive sterol regulatory element at -150, which counteracted activation through the downstream E-box. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a dominant negative form of adipocyte determination and differentiation factor 1 (ADD1) was used to neutralize endogenous ADD1/ sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcriptional activity in fat cells, by producing inactive dimers unable to bind target DNA. With this system, we observed that overexpression of FAS in obese rat adipocytes was ADD1/SREBP-dependent. SREBP isoforms expression was assessed in lean and obese rat fat cells and showed no differences in the level of ADD1/SREBP1 mRNA. In addition, equivalent amounts of immunoreactive ADD1/SREBP1 were found in nuclear extracts from lean and obese rat fat cells. In contrast, immunoreactive SREBP2, which was very low in nuclear extracts from lean rats, was induced in obese rat fat cells. Finally, using in vitro binding studies, we showed that SREBP2 was able to displace ADD1/SREBP1 binding from the sterol regulatory element (SRE) site. Thus, we propose a mechanism for obesity-related overexpression of FAS gene in rat adipocyte. ADD1/SREBP1-activated transcription proceeding from the E-box motif is counterbalanced by a negative SRE site acting by limiting the availability of ADD1/SREBP1 in normal fat cells. The negative effect of this site is abolished in obese rat adipocyte nuclei where SREBP2 is induced and can substitute for ADD1/SREBP1 binding to the inactive SRE. These results provide evidence for the implication of SREBPs in the dysregulation of adipocyte metabolism characteristic of the obese state.",0.0

Association studies examining the relationship between polymorphism at ADD1 codon 460 (G460W) and both hypertension and blood pressure, which were performed in a variety of human population samples derived from different genetic backgrounds, have given inconsistent results. We examined the association between the ADD1 G460W polymorphism and variation in blood pressure in a sample of non-diabetic, largely normotensive Canadian Oji-Cree from an isolated community in Northern Ontario. Among 481 Oji-Cree subjects, we measured blood pressure and related clinical phenotypes and determined genotypes of ADD1 G460W. We observed an allele frequency of 0.08 for the ADD1 W460 variant, which is among the lowest so far observed in human populations. We found significant associations between variation in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and gender, age, body mass index (BMI), and treatment for hypertension. However, we found no association between the ADD1 W460 allele and increased blood pressure, nor did we observe a higher frequency of the W460 allele in a hypertensive subgroup compared with normotensive subjects. While the low sample frequency of ADD1 W460 is consistent with the low sample prevalence of hypertension, the absence of a specific association with both blood pressure and hypertension suggests that the ADD1 W460 variant is not an important determinant of blood pressure among individuals of this genetic background.",0.0

ADD1 polymorphism was determined in 6,471 participants, including 599 patients with type 2 diabetes at baseline. The prevalence of hypertension in type 2 diabetic patients was 2.57 times higher in ADD1 TT carriers compared with GG carriers (95% CI 1.05-6.32, P = 0.03). Homozygous T carriers also had a higher mean common carotid intima media thickness (IMT) compared with GG carriers (mean difference 0.05 mm, P for trend = 0.03). In diabetic patients with hypertension, the risk of mortality was 1.83 times higher in homozygous T carriers compared with the GG genotype group (95% CI 1.07-3.16, P = 0.03). The increased risk was only present among TT carriers who did not use antidiabetes medication (hazard ratio 2.18 [95% CI 1.12-4.24], P = 0.02). The results of this population-based cohort study suggest that the ADD1 gene contributes to the risk of hypertension and increases mean common carotid IMT in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Using PCR-amplified binding analysis, we demonstrate that ADD1/SREBP1 has dual DNA sequence specificity, binding to both an E-box motif (ATCACGTGA) and a non-E-box sequence previously shown to be important in cholesterol metabolism, sterol regulatory element 1 (SRE-1; ATCACCCCAC). The ADD1/SREBP1 consensus E-box site is similar to a regulatory sequence designated the carbohydrate response element, defined by its ability to regulate transcription in response to carbohydrate in genes involved in fatty acid and triglyceride metabolism in liver and fat. When expressed in fibroblasts, ADD1/SREBP1 activates transcription through both the carbohydrate response E-box element and SRE-1. Substitution of an atypical tyrosine in the basic region of ADD1/SREBP1 to an arginine found in most bHLH protein causes a restriction to only E-box binding. Conversely, substitution of a tyrosine for the equivalent arginine in another bHLH protein, upstream stimulatory factor, allows this factor to acquire a dual binding specificity similar to that of ADD1/SREBP1. Promoter activation by ADD1/SREBP1 through the carbohydrate response element E box is not sensitive to the tyrosine-to-arginine mutation, while activation through SRE-1 is completely suppressed. These data illustrate that ADD1/SREBP1 has dual DNA sequence specificity controlled by a single amino acid residue; this dual specificity may provide a novel mechanism to coordinate different pathways of lipid metabolism.",0.0

The estrogen effects was observed within 6-18 h of treatment. In silicon analyses revealed presence of estrogen response elements in the proximal promoters of all five genes. RNPS1, ADD1, and PLXNA3 were underexpressed in OVCA cell lines compared to HOSE cell lines, while the opposite was true for rap-2 and SKIIP.

In contrast, rap-2 was found to cause significant oncogenic effects in OVCA cells, while SKIIP promotes only anchorage-independent growth.

The first control level is the regulation of the expression of PPARgamma. Examples of this regulation, during adipogenesis, is the transactivation of the PPARgamma promoter by transcription factors of the classical pathway, such as C/EBPs or ADD1/SREBP1, but also newly identified factors, such as E2Fs. When preadipocytes re-enter the cell cycle, PPARgamma expression is induced coincident with an increase in DNA synthesis, suggesting the involvement of the E2F family of cell cycle regulators. E2F1 induces PPARgamma transcription during clonal expansion, whereas E2F4 represses PPARgamma expression during terminal adipocyte differentiation. Hence, E2Fs represent the link between proliferative signaling pathways, triggering clonal expansion, and terminal adipocyte differentiation through regulation of PPARgamma expression. A second regulatory level of PPARgamma action is interaction with cofactors. We will focus our attention on the atypical PPARgamma modulators. We have described an interaction between PPARgamma and the retinoblastoma protein, RB, which is both dependent upon ligand binding by PPARgamma and upon the phosphorylation status of RB.

The present study was undertaken to obtain insights into the expression of these transcription factors during moderate weight loss in humans. In addition, the adipose depot-related differences and the relation to adipose lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression and plasma lipids were studied. Using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the total amount of each adipose transcription factor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was determined in the subcutaneous or omental adipose tissue after a controlled, 2-month, bodyweight-reduction trial in 11 obese middle-aged women and 17 comparable obese controls. Weight loss (6% of body weight) was associated with reduced serum insulin and plasma triacylglycerols. Adipose tissue PPARgamma2 and SREBP1c/ADD1 mRNA were lower in the weight-loss group than in controls (by 30% and 28%, respectively), whereas the C/EBPalpha mRNA level did not change. Moreover, PPARgamma2 mRNA was lower only in the subcutaneous adipose depot and was related to both adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA and improvement in plasma triacylglycerols in the weight-loss group. Our results suggest a functional role for SREBP1c/ADD1 and PPARgamma2 in the control of energy metabolism in human adipose tissue.",0.0

Loss of spindle pole integrity leads to multipolar spindles and aberrant chromosomal segregation. However, the mechanism underlying the maintenance of spindle pole integrity remains unclear. In this study, we show that the actin-binding protein adducin-1 (ADD1) is phosphorylated at S726 during mitosis. S726-phosphorylated ADD1 localizes to centrosomes, wherein it organizes into a rosette-like structure at the pericentriolar material. ADD1 depletion causes centriole splitting and therefore results in multipolar spindles during mitosis, which can be restored by re-expression of ADD1 and the phosphomimetic S726D mutant but not by the S726A mutant. Moreover, the phosphorylation of ADD1 at S726 is crucial for its interaction with TPX2, which is essential for spindle pole integrity. Together, our findings unveil a novel function of ADD1 in maintaining spindle pole integrity through its interaction with TPX2.",0.0

Our laboratory and others have shown that Ngb overexpression protects neurons against hypoxia/ischemia, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent studies demonstrate that hypoxia/ischemia induces a multitude of spatially and temporally regulated responses in gene expression, and initial evidence suggested that Ngb might function in altering biological processes of gene expression. In this study, we asked how Ngb may help regulate genes responsive to hypoxia. Expression of hypoxic response genes following oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) was examined using mRNA arrays in neuroglobin-overexpressing transgenic (Ngb-Tg) and wild type (WT) mouse neurons. From a total of 113 genes on the microarray, mRNA expression of 65 genes was detected. Under rest condition, 14 genes were downregulated in Ngb-Tg neurons compared to WT. In WT neurons, after 4-h OGD followed by 4-h reoxygenation (O4/R4), 20 genes were significantly downregulated, and only Fos mRNA was significantly increased. However, out of the 20 downregulated genes in WT neurons, 12 of them were no longer significantly changed in Ngb-Tg neurons: Add1, Arnt2, Camk2g, Cstb, Dr1, Epas1, Gna11, Hif1a, Il6st, Khsrp, Mars and Rara. Among these 12 genes, 8 (Add1, Camk2g, Cstb, Dr1, Epas1, Gna11, Hif1a, Khsrp) were already reduced in Ngb-Tg neurons compared to WT under rest conditions. Additionally, three genes that initially showed no changes in WT neurons (Ctgf, Egfr and Pea15) were downregulated after OGD in the Ngb-Tg neurons. These findings suggest that Ngb overexpression modulates mRNA expression of multiple hypoxic response genes in the early phase after OGD/reoxygenation. Further studies on these gene networks and interactions may lead to better understanding of Ngb in signaling pathways that contribute to neuroprotection.",0.0

Due to the beneficial effect of pre-freezing PBM therapy, group 2 exhibited the highest TSM and PSM levels compared to groups 1 and 3. At the same time, DNA fragmentation and lipid peroxidation were significantly reduced in the group 2 compared to the group 1 (p = 0.024 p = 0.016, respectively).

We have previously reported that sterol depletion in vivo caused a significant induction of both liver mRNA and enzyme activity of Dhcr7 (Bae, S.-H., Lee, J. N., Fitzky, B. U., Seong, J., and Paik, Y.-K. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 14624-14631). In this paper, we also observed liver cell-specific sterol-mediated Dhcr7 gene induction in vitro by sterol depletion in rat hepatoma cells, suggesting the presence of sterol-mediated regulatory elements in the Dhcr7 gene. To understand the mechanisms responsible for regulating Dhcr7 expression, we have isolated the 5'-flanking region of the gene encoding rat Dhcr7 and have characterized the potential regulatory elements of the gene that are responsible for sterol-mediated regulation. The Dhcr7 promoter contains binding sites for Sp1 (at -177, -172, -125, and -20), NF-Y (at -88 and -51), and SREBP-1 or ADD1 (at -33). Deletion analysis of the Dhcr7 gene promoter (-1053/+31), employing a nested series of Dhcr7-luciferase constructs, demonstrated that the -179 upstream region of the gene is necessary and sufficient for optimal efficient sterol-regulated transcription. DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that the SRE1/E box (-33/-22) involved in sterol response of many sterol-related enzyme genes was protected specifically by the overexpressed recombinant ADD1. Mutational analysis for the functional relationship between the identified cis-elements in this region indicate that one of the binding sites for Sp1 (GC box at -125) and NF-Y (CCAAT box at -88) plays a cooperative role in the sterol-mediated activation, in which the latter site also acts as a co-regulator for SREBP-activated Dhcr7 promoter activity. We believe that Dhcr7 is the first enzyme characterized with a sterol-regulatory function in the post-lanosterol pathway.

An example of a prospective efficacy of pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomics is the detection and impact of adducin polymorphism on hypertension. Adducin is a heterodimeric cytoskeleton protein, the three subunits of which are encoded by genes (ADD1, ADD2, and ADD3) that map to three different chromosomes. A long series of parallel studies in the Milan hypertensive rat strain model of hypertension and humans indicated that an altered adducin function might cause hypertension through an enhanced constitutive tubular sodium reabsorption. In particular, six linkage studies, 18 of 20 association studies, and four of five follow-up studies that measured organ damage in hypertensive patients support the clinical impact of adducing polymorphism. As many modulatory genes and environment affect the adducin activity, the context must be taken into account to measure the clinical effect size of adducins. Pharmacogenomics is giving an important contribution to this end.

The increase in GPAT mRNA levels that occurs during differentiation is partially prevented by ectopic expression of a dominant negative form of ADD1. Nucleotide sequences corresponding to the proximal promoter of the murine mitochondrial GPAT gene (Jerkins, A. A., Liu, W. R., Lee, S., and Sul, H. S. (1995) J. Biol.

This increase was attenuated when either a dominant negative form of NF-Y was co-transfected into the cells or when the GPAT promoter contained mutations in the putative binding sites for SREBP-1a or NF-Y. These studies demonstrate that the regulated expression of the mitochondrial GPAT gene requires both NF-Y and ADD1/SREBPs.

Taken the advantages of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we investigated α-adducin (add-1) in aversive olfactory associative learning and memory. Loss of add-1 function selectively impaired short- and long-term memory without causing acquisition, sensory, or motor deficits. We showed that α-adducin is required for consolidation of synaptic plasticity, for sustained synaptic increase of AMPA-type glutamate receptor (GLR-1) content and altered GLR-1 turnover dynamics. ADD-1, in a splice-form- and tissue-specific manner, controlled the storage of memories presumably through actin-capping activity. In support of the C. elegans results, genetic variability of the human ADD1 gene was significantly associated with episodic memory performance in healthy young subjects. Finally, human ADD1 expression in nematodes restored loss of C. elegans add-1 gene function. Taken together, our findings support a role for α-adducin in memory from nematodes to humans.

To accomplish this, we evaluated the effects of activated CREB on the promoter activity of the mouse adiponectin gene, and identified the cAMP-response element (CRE) in the promoter. The constitutively active form of CREB increased the promoter activity of the mouse adiponectin gene. In addition, transfection studies using 5' serial deleted promoters revealed the presence of a putative CRE located between the -1250 and -1000bp region. Furthermore, an electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis demonstrated that CREB bound to the region between -1022 and -995 in the adiponectin promoter. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), which activate CREB, increased the adiponectin promoter activity. However, this stimulation was prevented by the dominant negative form of CREB (ACREB) and pretreatment with PD098059, indicating that IGF-1 stimulate adiponectin expression through CREB phosphorylation via the ERK pathway. Importantly, the transactivation of adiponectin expression by CREB was inhibited by ATF3. Coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assay revealed that ATF3 bound to CREB and prevented CREB phosphorylation induced during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

This gene is more than 60 kb long and contains 23 exons and 22 introns. Its transcription-initiation site within exon 1 is separate from the initiation codon in exon 2. Analysis of the exon/intron structure revealed that the S1P gene consists of a mosaic of functional units: exon 1 encodes the 5' non-translated region; exon 2 encodes the NH2-terminal signal sequence; and exons 2 and 3 encode the pro-peptide sequence that is released when S1P is self-activated by intramolecular cleavage.

ATE1 expression is significantly reduced in human HCC samples compared with normal liver tissue. In addition, low ATE1 expression is correlated with aggressive clinicopathologic features and is an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-free survival of patients with HCC. Lentivirus-mediated ATE1 knockdown significantly promoted liver cancer growth, migration, and disease progression in vitro and in vivo. Opposing results were observed when ATE1 was upregulated. Mechanistically, ATE1 accelerated the degradation of β-catenin and inhibited Wnt signaling by regulating turnover of Regulator of G Protein Signaling 5 (RGS5). Loss- and gain-of-function assays confirmed that RGS5 was a key effector of ATE1-mediated regulation of Wnt signaling. Further studies indicated that RGS5 might be involved in regulating the activity of GSK3-β, a crucial component of the cytoplasmic destruction complex. Treatment with a GSK inhibitor (CHIR99021) cooperated with ablation of ATE1 or RGS5 overexpression to promote Wnt/β-catenin signaling, but overexpression of ATE1 or RGS5 knockdown did not reverse the effect of GSK inhibitor.

ATE1 expression was higher in metastatic tumours, compared with primary tumours. Consistent with these findings, ATE1 depletion reduced melanoma cell viability, migration and colony formation. Reduced ATE1 expression also affected cell responses to mTOR and MEK inhibitors and to serum deprivation.

Nt-Arg of a protein is among Nt-residues that can be recognized as destabilizing ones by the Arg/N-degron pathway. A proteolytic cleavage of a protein can generate Arg at the N terminus of a resulting C-terminal (Ct) fragment either directly or after Nt-arginylation of that Ct-fragment by the Ate1 arginyl-tRNA-protein transferase (R-transferase), which uses Arg-tRNAArg as a cosubstrate. Ate1 can Nt-arginylate Nt-Asp, Nt-Glu, and oxidized Nt-Cys* (Cys-sulfinate or Cys-sulfonate) of proteins or short peptides. Ate1 genes of fungi, animals, and plants have been cloned decades ago, but a three-dimensional structure of Ate1 remained unknown. A detailed mechanism of arginylation is unknown as well. We describe here the crystal structure of the Ate1 R-transferase from the budding yeast Kluyveromyces lactis. The 58-kDa R-transferase comprises two domains that recognize, together, an acidic Nt-residue of an acceptor substrate, the Arg residue of Arg-tRNAArg, and a 3'-proximal segment of the tRNAArg moiety. The enzyme's active site is located, at least in part, between the two domains. In vitro and in vivo arginylation assays with site-directed Ate1 mutants that were suggested by structural results yielded inferences about specific binding sites of Ate1. We also analyzed the inhibition of Nt-arginylation activity of Ate1 by hemin (Fe3+-heme), and found that hemin induced the previously undescribed disulfide-mediated oligomerization of Ate1.

Visualization of actin cytoskeleton dynamics by live-cell microscopy indicated significant changes in comparison to wild-type cells. Ate1-null cells were almost completely lacking focal actin adhesion sites at the substrate-attached surface and were only weakly adhesive. In two-dimensional chemotaxis assays toward folate or cAMP, the motility of ate1-null cells was increased. However, in three-dimensional chemotaxis involving more confined conditions, the motility of ate1-null cells was significantly reduced. Live-cell imaging showed that GFP-tagged Ate1 rapidly relocates to sites of newly formed actin-rich protrusions. By mass spectrometric analysis, we identified four arginylation sites in the most abundant actin isoform of Dictyostelium, in addition to arginylation sites in other actin isoforms and several actin-binding proteins.

Cultured Ate1 knockout neurons showed a reduction in the neurite outgrowth and the levels of doublecortin and F-actin in the growth cones. In wild type, ATE1 prominently localized to the growth cones, in addition to the cell bodies. Examination of the Ate1 mRNA sequence reveals the existence of putative zipcode-binding sequences involved in mRNA targeting to the cell periphery and local translation at the growth cones. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that Ate1 mRNA localized to the tips of the growth cones, likely due to zipcode-mediated targeting, and this localization coincided with spots of localization of arginylated β-actin, which disappeared in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors.

In minigenes, single and double mutations that disrupt base pairings in R1R3 and R3R4 lead to the loss of MXE splicing, while compensatory triple mutations that restore RNA structure revert splicing to that of the wild type. In the endogenous Ate1 pre-mRNA, blocking the competing base pairings by LNA/DNA mixmers complementary to R3 leads to the loss of MXE splicing, while the disruption of R2R5 interaction changes the ratio of MXE.

Exon 7a becomes more included in response to RNA Pol II slowdown, however it fails to do so when the ultra-long-range R2R5 interaction is disrupted, indicating that exon 7a/7b ratio depends on co-transcriptional RNA folding.

Using mice with muscle-specific Tug (Aspscr1)-knockout and muscle-specific constitutive TUG cleavage, we show that, after GLUT4 release, the TUG C-terminal cleavage product enters the nucleus, binds peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ and its coactivator PGC-1α and regulates gene expression to promote lipid oxidation and thermogenesis. This pathway acts in muscle and adipose cells to upregulate sarcolipin and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), respectively.

However, here we found that arginylation promotes cell death and/or growth arrest, depending on the nature and intensity of the stressing factor. Specifically, in yeast, mouse and human cells, deletion or downregulation of the ATE1 gene disrupts typical stress responses by bypassing growth arrest and suppressing cell death events in the presence of disease-related stressing factors, including oxidative, heat, and osmotic stresses, as well as the exposure to heavy metals or radiation. Conversely, in wild-type cells responding to stress, there is an increase of cellular Ate1 protein level and arginylation activity. Furthermore, the increase of Ate1 protein directly promotes cell death in a manner dependent on its arginylation activity.

Results show that proteasome inhibitors (PIs) increased ATE1 (arginyltransferase 1)-mediated R-HSPA5 levels in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner. Further, binding of fully ubiquitinated AKT with R-HSPA5 induced AKT degradation via the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Specifically, the K48 (Lys48)-linked ubiquitinated form of AKT was selectively degraded in the lysosome with R-HSPA5. The deubiquitinase, USP7 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 7), prevented AKT degradation by inhibiting AKT ubiquitination via interaction with AKT. MUL1 (mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase activator of NFKB 1) also played a vital role in the lysosomal degradation of AKT by sequentially ubiquitinating AKT residues K284 to K214 for R-HSPA5-mediated autophagy. Consistent with this finding, despite HSPA5 arginylation, AKT was not degraded in mul1 KO cells. These results suggest that MUL1-mediated sequential ubiquitination of K284 to K214 may serve as a novel mechanism by which AKT is designated for lysosomal degradation. Moreover, binding of R-HSPA5 with fully ubiquitinated AKT is required for the autophagic/lysosomal degradation of AKT.

Here, we show that the N-degron pathway mediates pexophagy, in which damaged peroxisomal fragments are degraded by autophagy under normal and oxidative stress conditions. This degradative process initiates when the Nt-Cys of ACAD10 (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family, member 10), a receptor in pexophagy, is oxidized into Cys sulfinic (CysO2) or sulfonic acid (CysO3) by ADO (2-aminoethanethiol (cysteamine) dioxygenase). Under oxidative stress, the Nt-Cys of ACAD10 is chemically oxidized by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The oxidized Nt-Cys2 is arginylated by ATE1-encoded R-transferases, generating the RCOX N-degron. RCOX-ACAD10 marks the site of pexophagy via the interaction with PEX5 and binds the ZZ domain of SQSTM1/p62, recruiting LC3+-autophagic membranes. In mice, knockout of either Ate1 responsible for Nt-arginylation or Sqstm1/p62 leads to increased levels of peroxisomes. In the cells from patients with peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), characterized by peroxisomal loss due to uncontrolled pexophagy, inhibition of either ATE1 or SQSTM1/p62 was sufficient to recover the level of peroxisomes.

We report that ATE1 centrally controls the hypoxic response and glycolysis in mammalian cells by preferentially arginylating HIF1α that is hydroxylated by PHD in the presence of oxygen. Furthermore, the degradation of arginylated HIF1α is independent of pVHL E3 ubiquitin ligase but dependent on the UBR family proteins.

Here we found that Aβ peptides inhibited the proteolytic activity of the antiapoptotic Arg/N-end rule pathway that is a part of UPS. We identified arginyltransferase Ate1 as a specific component of the Arg/N-end rule pathway targeted by Aβs. Aβ bearing the familial English H6R mutation, known to cause early-onset AD, had an even greater inhibitory effect on protein degradation through the Arg/N-end rule pathway than intact Aβ. This effect was associated with a significant decrease in Ate1-1 and Ate1-3 catalytic activity. We also found that the loss of Ate1 in neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells eliminated the apoptosis-inducing effects of Aβ peptides.

The data support a model in which intact TUG traps insulin-responsive ""GLUT4 storage vesicles"" at the Golgi matrix by binding vesicle cargoes with its N-terminus and matrix proteins with its C-terminus. Insulin stimulation liberates these vesicles by triggering endoproteolytic cleavage of TUG, mediated by the Usp25m protease. Cleavage occurs in fat and muscle cells, but not in fibroblasts or other cell types. Proteolytic processing of intact TUG generates TUGUL, a ubiquitin-like protein modifier, as the N-terminal cleavage product. In adipocytes, TUGUL modifies a single protein, the KIF5B kinesin motor, which carries GLUT4 and other vesicle cargoes to the cell surface. In muscle, this or another motor may be modified. After cleavage of intact TUG, the TUG C-terminal product is extracted from the Golgi matrix by the p97 (VCP) ATPase. In both muscle and fat, this cleavage product enters the nucleus, binds PPARγ and PGC-1α, and regulates gene expression to promote fatty acid oxidation and thermogenesis.

Absence of arginylation inhibited expression of two key adipogenic transcription factors PPARγ and C/EBPα, and their downstream adipogenic genes (FABP4, GLUT4, PLN1). Arginylation did not affect the induction of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, the up-stream regulators of PPARγ gene. However, absence of arginylation affected PPARγ protein expression, independent of its transcript level. The constitutive expression of PPARγ1 protein in Ate1 KO cells as well as ATE1 inhibitor treated wild type cells were dampened due to increased proteasome mediated degradation of PPARγ1 in the absence of arginylation in the cells. Taken together these observations suggested arginylation mediated transcriptional regulation of PPARγ and C/EBPα was downstream of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, and that the arginylation mediated regulation of PPARγ protein expression may play a role in this process. The inhibition of arginylation in mature adipocytes also reduced expression of lipogenesis genes and decreased fat accumulation in differentiated adipocytes.

Furthermore, Dfa(A) was present in the interchromatin granule clusters and was also found to bind to the Ggnbp1 gametogenetin-binding protein-1 and to the Abt1 activator of basal transcription that interacts with the TATA-binding protein. Given these results, RNA interference was used to probe the influence of Dfa levels in luciferase reporter assays. We found that Dfa(A) acts as a repressor of TATA-box transcriptional promoters.",0.0

To test the role of arginylation in the skeletal muscle, we generated a mouse model with Ate1 deletion driven by the skeletal muscle-specific creatine kinase (Ckmm) promoter. Ckmm-Ate1 mice were viable and outwardly normal; however, their skeletal muscle strength was significantly reduced in comparison to controls. Mass spectrometry of isolated skeletal myofibrils showed a limited set of proteins, including myosin heavy chain, arginylated on specific sites. Atomic force microscopy measurements of contractile strength in individual myofibrils and isolated myosin filaments from these mice showed a significant reduction of contractile forces, which, in the case of myosin filaments, could be fully rescued by rearginylation with purified Ate1. Our results demonstrate that arginylation regulates force production in muscle and exerts a direct effect on muscle strength through arginylation of myosin.",0.0

In MSI-H CRCs, defects of mismatch repair genes produce increased mutation accumulation in repetitive DNA sequences. To see whether candidate tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) are altered in MSI-H CRC, we studied frameshift mutation and protein expression of candidate TSGs of RGS2, HNF1A, HNF1B, CAPN12, RCBTB2, ATE1, PKNOX1, and USP19. We found frameshift mutations of RGS2 in 5 (5%), HNF1A in 6 (6%), HNF1B in 2 (2%), CAPN12 in 3 (3%), RCBTB2 in 4 (4%), ATE1 in 2 (2%), PKNOX1 in 2 (2%), and USP19 in 2 (2%) MSI-H CRCs. However, we found no such mutations in MSS CRCs. RCBTB2, CAPN12, HNF1A, and HNF1B frameshift mutations revealed the regional difference in the same tumors. In addition, we identified loss of RGS2, HNF1A, and CAPN12 protein expression irrespective of MSI phenotype in 13-29% of CRCs. The results indicate that many TSGs harbor concurrent inactivating mutations and protein loss in MSI-H CRCs with intratumoral mutational heterogeneity, and that MSS CRCs are altered by protein losses. These alterations could contribute to CRC development and underlying mechanisms and consequences of the TSG alterations remain to be clarified.",0.0

We recently showed that arginylation exerts a number of intracellular effects by modifying proteins involved in the functioning of the actin cytoskeleton and in cell motility. Here, we investigated the role of arginylation in the development and function of cardiac myocytes and their actin-containing structures during embryogenesis. Biochemical and mass spectrometry analyses showed that alpha cardiac actin undergoes arginylation at four sites during development. Ultrastructural analysis of the myofibrils in wild-type and Ate1 knockout mouse hearts showed that the absence of arginylation results in defects in myofibril structure that delay their development and affect the continuity of myofibrils throughout the heart, predicting defects in cardiac contractility. Comparison of cardiac myocytes derived from wild-type and Ate1 knockout mouse embryos revealed that the absence of arginylation results in abnormal beating patterns. Our results demonstrate cell-autonomous cardiac myocyte defects in arginylation knockout mice that lead to severe congenital abnormalities similar to those observed in human disease, and outline a new function of arginylation in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in cardiac myocytes.",0.0

The search for a potential mechanism linking PD to RA and OA continues, as it could play a significant role in disease prevention and treatment. Recent studies have linked RA, OA, and PD to Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG), a periodontal bacterium, through a similar dysregulation in an inflammatory mechanism. This study aimed to identify potential gene signatures that could assist in early diagnosis as well as gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of these diseases. The expression data sets with the series IDs GSE97779, GSE123492, and GSE24897 for macrophages of RA, OA synovium, and PG stimulated macrophages (PG-SM), respectively, were retrieved and screened for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The 72 common DEGs among RA, OA, and PG-SM were further subjected to gene-gene correlation analysis. A GeneMANIA interaction network of the 47 highly correlated DEGs comprises 53 nodes and 271 edges. Network centrality analysis identified 15 hub genes, 6 of which are DEGs (API5, ATE1, CCNG1, EHD1, RIN2, and STK39). Additionally, two significantly up-regulated non-hub genes (IER3 and RGS16) showed interactions with hub genes. Functional enrichment analysis of the genes showed that ""apoptotic regulation"" and ""inflammasomes"" were among the major pathways.

Here we found that α-syn is a highly efficient substrate for arginyltransferase ATE1 and is arginylated in vivo by a novel mid-chain mechanism that targets the acidic side chains of E46 and E83. Lack of arginylation leads to increased α-syn aggregation and causes the formation of larger pathological aggregates in neurons, accompanied by impairments in its ability to be cleared via normal degradation pathways. In the mouse brain, lack of arginylation leads to an increase in α-syn's insoluble fraction, accompanied by behavioral changes characteristic for neurodegenerative pathology. Our data show that lack of arginylation in the brain leads to neurodegeneration, and suggests that α-syn arginylation can be a previously unknown factor that facilitates normal α-syn folding and function in vivo.",0.0

990,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America ,PUBMED: 29507222; ,"The conjugation of amino acids to the protein N termini is universally observed in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, yet its functions remain poorly understood. In eukaryotes, the amino acid l-arginine (l-Arg) is conjugated to N-terminal Asp (Nt-Asp), Glu, Gln, Asn, and Cys, directly or associated with posttranslational modifications. Following Nt-arginylation, the Nt-Arg is recognized by UBR boxes of N-recognins such as UBR1, UBR2, UBR4/p600, and UBR5/EDD, leading to substrate ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation via the N-end rule pathway. It has been a mystery, however, why studies for the past five decades identified only a handful of Nt-arginylated substrates in mammals, although five of 20 principal amino acids are eligible for arginylation. Here, we show that the Nt-Arg functions as a bimodal degron that directs substrates to either the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome system (UPS) or macroautophagy depending on physiological states. In normal conditions, the arginylated forms of proteolytic cleavage products, D101-CDC6 and D1156-BRCA1, are targeted to UBR box-containing N-recognins and degraded by the proteasome. However, when proteostasis by the UPS is perturbed, their Nt-Arg redirects these otherwise cellular wastes to macroautophagy through its binding to the ZZ domain of the autophagic adaptor p62/STQSM/Sequestosome-1. Upon binding to the Nt-Arg, p62 acts as an autophagic N-recognin that undergoes self-polymerization, facilitating cargo collection and lysosomal degradation of p62-cargo complexes. A chemical mimic of Nt-Arg redirects Ub-conjugated substrates from the UPS to macroautophagy and promotes their lysosomal degradation. Our results suggest that the Nt-Arg proteome of arginylated proteins contributes to reprogramming global proteolytic flux under stresses.",0.0

We reconstituted this process in vitro as well. The levels of regulatory proteins bearing N-terminal cysteine, such as RGS4, RGS5 and RGS16, are greatly increased in mouse ATE1-/- embryos, which lack arginylation. Stabilization of these proteins, the first physiological substrates of mammalian N-end rule pathway, may underlie cardiovascular defects in ATE1-/- embryos.

To date, little is known about how cells modulate SQSTM1 activity and autophagosome biogenesis in response to accumulating cargoes. In this study, we show that SQSTM1 is an N-recognin whose ZZ domain binds N-terminal arginine (Nt-Arg) and other N-degrons (Nt-Lys, Nt-His, Nt-Trp, Nt-Phe, and Nt-Tyr) of the N-end rule pathway. The substrates of SQSTM1 include the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-residing chaperone HSPA5/GRP78/BiP. Upon N-end rule interaction with the Nt-Arg of arginylated HSPA5 (R-HSPA5), SQSTM1 undergoes self-polymerization via disulfide bonds of Cys residues including Cys113, facilitating cargo collection. In parallel, Nt-Arg-bound SQSTM1 acts as an inducer of autophagosome biogenesis and autophagic flux. Through this dual regulatory mechanism, SQSTM1 plays a key role in the crosstalk between the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy. Based on these results, we employed 3D-modeling of SQSTM1 and a virtual chemical library to develop small molecule ligands to the ZZ domain of SQSTM1. These autophagy inducers accelerated the autophagic removal of mutant HTT (huntingtin) aggregates.

Mice lacking the enzyme arginyltransferase in skeletal muscles exhibit reduced contractile forces that have been linked to a reduction in myosin cross-bridge formation. The role of arginylation in passive skeletal myofibril forces has never been investigated. In this study, we used single sarcomere and myofibril measurements and observed that lack of arginylation leads to a pronounced reduction in passive forces in skeletal muscles. Mass spectrometry indicated that skeletal muscle titin, the protein primarily linked to passive force generation, is arginylated on five sites located within the A band, an important area for protein-protein interactions. We propose a mechanism for passive force regulation by arginylation through modulation of protein-protein binding between the titin molecule and the thick filament. Key points are as follows: 1) active and passive forces were decreased in myofibrils and single sarcomeres isolated from muscles lacking arginyl-tRNA-protein transferase (ATE1). 2) Mass spectrometry revealed five sites for arginylation within titin molecules. All sites are located within the A-band portion of titin, an important region for protein-protein interactions. 3) Our data suggest that arginylation of titin is required for proper passive force development in skeletal muscles.",0.0

These two systems coordinate the removal of unwanted intracellular materials, but the mechanism by which they achieve this synchronization is largely unknown. The ubiquitination of substrates serves as a universal degradation signal for both systems. Our study revealed that the amino-terminal Arg, a canonical N-degron in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, also acts as a degradation signal in autophagy. We showed that many ER residents, such as BiP, contain evolutionally conserved arginylation permissive pro-N-degrons, and that certain inducers like dsDNA or proteasome inhibitors cause their translocation into the cytoplasm where they bind misfolded proteins and undergo amino-terminal arginylation by arginyl transferase 1 (ATE1). The amino-terminal Arg of BiP binds p62, which triggers p62 oligomerization and enhances p62-LC3 interaction, thereby stimulating autophagic delivery and degradation of misfolded proteins, promoting cell survival. This study reveals a novel ubiquitin-independent mechanism for the selective autophagy pathway, and provides an insight into how these two major protein degradation pathways communicate in cells to dispose the unwanted proteins.",0.0

If a substrate bears, for example, Nt-Asn, its targeting involves deamidation of Nt-Asn, arginylation of resulting Nt-Asp, binding of resulting (conjugated) Nt-Arg to the UBR1-RAD6 E3-E2 ubiquitin ligase, ligase-mediated synthesis of a substrate-linked polyubiquitin chain, its capture by the proteasome, and substrate's degradation. We discovered that the human Nt-Asn-specific Nt-amidase NTAN1, Nt-Gln-specific Nt-amidase NTAQ1, arginyltransferase ATE1, and the ubiquitin ligase UBR1-UBE2A/B (or UBR2-UBE2A/B) form a complex in which NTAN1 Nt-amidase binds to NTAQ1, ATE1, and UBR1/UBR2. In addition, NTAQ1 Nt-amidase and ATE1 arginyltransferase also bind to UBR1/UBR2. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Nt-amidase, arginyltransferase, and the double-E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR1-RAD6/UFD4-UBC4/5 are shown to form an analogous targeting complex. These complexes may enable substrate channeling, in which a substrate bearing, for example, Nt-Asn, would be captured by a complex-bound Nt-amidase, followed by sequential Nt modifications of the substrate and its polyubiquitylation at an internal Lys residue without substrate's dissociation into the bulk solution. At least in yeast, the UBR1/UFD4 ubiquitin ligase interacts with the 26S proteasome, suggesting an even larger Arg/N-degron-targeting complex that contains the proteasome as well. In addition, specific features of protein-sized Arg/N-degron substrates, including their partly sequential and partly nonsequential enzymatic modifications, led us to a verifiable concept termed ""superchanneling."" In superchanneling, the synthesis of a substrate-linked poly-Ub chain can occur not only after a substrate's sequential Nt modifications, but also before them, through a skipping of either some or all of these modifications within a targeting complex.",0.0

In search of a factor responsible for these phenomena, the current study identified human antigen R (HuR) as a direct target of arginylation. HS induced arginylation of HuR affected its stability and RNA binding activity. Arginylated HuR failed to bind Hsp70.3 3' UTR, allowing the recruitment of cleavage stimulating factor 64 (CstF64) in the proximal poly-A-site (PAS), generating transcripts with short 3'UTR. However, HuR from Ate1 knock out (KO) MEFs bound to proximal PAS region with higher affinity, thus excluded CstF64 recruitment. This inhibited the alternative polyadenylation (APA) of Hsp70.3 mRNA and generated the unstable transcripts with long 3'UTR. The inhibition of RNA binding activity of HuR was traced to arginylation-coupled phosphorylation of HuR, by check point kinase 2 (Chk2). Arginylation of HuR occurred at the residue D15 and the arginylation was needed for the phosphorylation. Accumulation of HuR also decreased cell viability upon HS. In conclusion, arginylation dependent modifications of HuR maintained its cellular homeostasis, and promoted APA of Hsp70.3 pre-mRNA, during early HS response.",0.0

The mechanisms underlying the resistance of tumor cells to apoptosis induced by specific drugs remain unclear. We evaluated the regulatory role of R-CRT in apoptosis of human glioma cell lines treated with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BT). Two cell lines (HOG, MO59K) displaying distinctive susceptibility to apoptosis induction were studied further. BT efficiency was found to be correlated with a subcellular distribution of R-CRT. In MO59K (apoptosis-resistant), R-CRT was confined to SGs formed following BT treatment. In contrast, HOG (apoptosis-susceptible) treated with BT showed lower SG formation and higher levels of cytosolic and PM R-CRT. Increased R-CRT level was associated with enhanced mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and with sustained apoptosis activation via upregulation of cell death receptor DR5. R-CRT overexpression in the cytoplasm of MO59K rendered the cells susceptible to BT-induced, DR5-mediated cell death.
