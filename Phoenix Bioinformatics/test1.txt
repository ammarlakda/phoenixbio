Lung cancers caused by activating mutations in the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) are initially responsive to smallmolecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but the efÔ¨Åcacy of theseagents is often limited because of the emergence of drug resistanceconferred by a second mutation, T790M. Threonine 790 is the‚Äò‚Äògatekeeper‚Äô‚Äô residue, an important determinant of inhibitorspeciÔ¨Åcity in the ATP binding pocket. The T790M mutation hasbeen thought to cause resistance by sterically blocking binding ofTKIs such as geÔ¨Åtinib and erlotinib, but this explanation is difÔ¨Åcultto reconcile with the fact that it remains sensitive to structurallysimilar irreversible inhibitors. Here, we show by using a directbinding assay that T790M mutants retain low-nanomolar afÔ¨Ånityfor geÔ¨Åtinib. Furthermore, we show that the T790M mutationactivates WT EGFR and that introduction of the T790M mutationincreases the ATP afÔ¨Ånity of the oncogenic L858R mutant by morethan an order of magnitude. The increased ATP afÔ¨Ånity is theprimary mechanism by which the T790M mutation confers drugresistance. Crystallographic analysis of the T790M mutant showshow it can adapt to accommodate tight binding of diverse inhib-itors, including the irreversible inhibitor HKI-272, and also suggestsa structural mechanism for catalytic activation. We conclude thatthe T790M mutation is a ‚Äò‚Äògeneric‚Äô‚Äô resistance mutation that willreduce the potency of any ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor andthat irreversible inhibitors overcome this resistance simply throughcovalent binding, not as a result of an alternative binding mode.

Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) have recently been iden-
tified as a cause of nonsmall cell lung cancer (1‚Äì7). The mostcommon oncogenic mutations are small, in-frame deletions inexon 19 and a point mutation that substitutes Leu-858 witharginine (L858R). These mutations likely cause constitutiveactivation of the kinase by destabilizing the autoinhibited con-
formation (8, 9), which is normally maintained in the absence ofligand stimulation. Importantly, the activating mutations havealso been found to confer sensitivity to the small moleculetyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib (1‚Äì3). Asfirst reported by Carey et al. (10) in studies with erlotinib, the
mutant kinases bind the inhibitors more tightly than does the WTEGFR and additionally the deletion and L858R mutationsmarkedly decrease the affinity of the kinase for ATP (8, 10), withwhich the inhibitors compete for binding. These two effectscombine to yield the remarkable potency of gefitinib anderlotinib against tumors and cell lines that are ‚Äò‚Äòaddicted‚Äô‚Äô to theactivated EGFR for survival (5, 11, 12).
Clinically, the efficacy of these TKIs is often of limited
duration because of the emergence of drug resistance conferredby a second mutation: substitution of threonine 790 with me-thionine (T790M) (13‚Äì15). The T790M mutation accounts forabout half of all resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib (16, 17).Threonine 790 is the gatekeeper residue in EGFR, so namedbecause its key location at the entrance to a hydrophobic pocket
in the back of the ATP binding cleft makes it an importantdeterminant of inhibitor specificity in protein kinases. Substitu-tion of this residue in EGFR with a bulky methionine has beenthought to cause resistance by steric interference with binding ofTKIs, including gefitinib and erlotinib (13‚Äì15). However, theT790M mutant kinase remains sensitive to irreversible inhibi-tors, including CL-387,785, EKB-569, and HKI-272 (14, 15,18‚Äì20). These compounds closely resemble the reversible ani-linoquinazoline inhibitors, but contain a reactive Michael-acceptor group that forms a covalent bond with Cys-797 at theedge of the ATP-binding cleft (Fig. 1). The irreversible inhibitorsare designed to target only this cysteine in EGFR because oftheir specific noncovalent interactions in the ATP bindingpocket, which resemble those of reversible anilinoquinazolinecompounds. Thus the fact that these irreversible TKIs still inhibitthe T790M mutant is at odds with steric hindrance as a mech-anism of resistance: the reversible inhibitor gefitinib and theirreversible inhibitor EKB-569 have identical aniline substitu-ents that are expected to bind in the gatekeeper pocket (Fig. 1),so the same steric effects that block gefitinib binding should alsoprevent the initial binding of EKB-569 (and of the relatedcompound HKI-272).
A number of observations indicate that in addition to confer-
ring drug resistance, the gatekeeper mutation may derepress the
catalytic activity of EGFR and other kinases. A germ-lineT790M mutation has been discovered in a family with a hered-itary predisposition to lung cancer, suggesting that this mutationconfers a growth advantage in the absence of the selectivepressure of TKIs (21). Consistent with this idea, introduction ofthe T790M in tandem with the L858R mutant in NIH 3T3 cellsincreases EGFR activity and enhances the transformed pheno-type (22). Transgenic mice engineered with lung-specific expres-sion of the T790M mutant develop lung adenocarcinomas (23),albeit with a longer latency than those harboring the L858R orcombined L858R and T790M mutations (23, 24). The EGFRT790M mutation was also identified in an untreated case ofBarrett‚Äôs esophagus and the corresponding adenocarcinoma(25). Interestingly, the corresponding mutation in BCR-Abl

deregulation, we have studied the structural and enzymological
effects of the T790M mutation in the context of both the WT andthe L858R-mutant EGFR kinases.
Results
T790M Mutants Bind Gefitinib with Low Nanomolar Affinity. We first
measured binding of gefitinib to the WT, L858R, T790M, andL858R/T790M mutants by using a direct binding assay in whichintrinsic fluorescence of EGFR is quenched by titration withthe inhibitor (8). Strikingly, the T790M mutation only mod-estly affects binding of gefitinib in the context of the L858Rmutant (Table 1). The resistant L858R/T790M double-bindsgefitinib with K
d/H1100510.9 nM, which is only /H110154-fold weaker than
the exquisitely sensitive L858R mutant ( Kd/H110052.4 nM). The
T790M mutant binds gefitinib with Kd/H110054.6 nM, nearly as
tightly as the L858R mutant and considerably tighter than theWT kinase. The small difference in gefitinib affinity caused byintroduction of the secondary T790M mutation is in starkcontrast to the roughly two orders of magnitude differencesobserved in the sensitivity of cell lines bearing the L858R vs.L858R/T790M or exon 19 deletions with T790M mutations(13‚Äì15, 29), and therefore cannot explain the clinically ob-
served drug resistance. We also examined binding of thepyrrolopyrimidine compound AEE788 (Novartis Pharmaceu-ticals), which binds in a manner similar to gefitinib despite thedifference in chemical scaffold (8). The T790M mutant has amore dramatic effect on the affinity for AEE788, but notablythe L858R/T790M double mutant retains 18.6 nM affinity forthis compound (as compared with K
d/H110051.1 nM for the L858R
mutant). The larger effect on AEE788 as compared withgefitinib is not unexpected because the phenethylamine sub-stituent on this inhibitor extends further into the hydrophobicpocket that is ‚Äò‚Äòguarded‚Äô‚Äô by the gatekeeper residue (8).
Crystal Structures of T790M Mutant. Crystal structures of the
T790M mutant show how inhibitors are accommodated in thepresence of the gatekeeper mutation, in both the active andinactive conformations of the kinase. We determined struc-tures of the T790M mutant alone and in complex with theirreversible inhibitor HKI-272 in the inactive conformation orin complex with AEE788 in the active conformation [seesupporting information (SI) Table 3 for crystallographic sta-
tistics]. The structure of the T790M mutant in complex withAEE788 is shown in Fig. 2 A. The compound binds in essen-
tially the same manner observed in the WT enzyme, with thepyrrolopyrimidine core making two hydrogen bonds with thehinge region of the kinase and the phenethylamine substituentextending into the gatekeeper hydrophobic pocket. Compar-ison with the binding of AEE788 to the WT enzyme revealsonly a small rotation of the phenethylamine substituent, whichis in direct contact with the mutant gatekeeper residue.Comparison of the AEE788 complex with the structure of theT790M mutant in the absence of inhibitor (Apo-T790M) showsthat the Met-790 side chain must adopt a different rotamer toaccommodate the inhibitor (Fig. 2 B).The irreversible inhibitor HKI-272 is a 4-(arylamino)quino-
line-3-carbonitrile compound and a potent inhibitor of bothEGFR and ErbB2 kinases (14, 30). In complex with HKI-272,the EGFR kinase adopts an inactive conformation in which theregulatory C-helix is displaced from its active position (Fig.2C). The enlarged hydrophobic pocket created by the outward
rotation of the C-helix appears to be required to accommodatethe bulky aniline substituent found in HKI-272. Both HKI-272and lapatinib contain additional aromatic groups appended tothe aniline ring (a 2-pyridinyl group in HKI-272 and a fluoro-phenyl group in lapatinib; Fig. 1). Thus it is not surprising thatHKI-272, like lapatinib, binds the inactive conformation of thekinase and that the overall binding mode of the two com-pounds is similar (Fig. 2 D). The quinoline core of HKI-272
forms a single hydrogen bond with the hinge region of thekinase in a manner analogous to anilinoquinazoline com-pounds (31, 32). The 2-pyridinyl group of HKI-272 is sur-rounded by hydrophobic residues in the expanded pocket,including Met-766 in the C-helix, Phe-856, and Met-790, themutant gatekeeper residue. The nitrile substituent of HKI-272also approaches the gatekeeper residue (extending to /H110153√Ö
from the methionine side chain). In addition to these nonco-valent interactions of HKI-272, the expected covalent bond isformed between Cys-797 at the edge of the active site cleft andthe crotonamide Michael-acceptor group on the inhibitor,rendering binding irreversible (Fig. 2 C). Although the reso-
lution of the structure is modest, electron density for theinhibitor and for the covalent bond is clear ( SI Fig. 4 ).
The structure of the T790M mutant also suggests a possible
mechanism of catalytic activation. We hypothesize that themutation facilitates interconversion between the inactive andactive conformations via direct interaction with the Asp-Phe-Glysequence (DFG motif) at the base of the kinase activation loop(see SI Figs. 5 and 6 and related discussion in SI Text ). The
mutation may also enhance the stability of the active confor-mation (relative to the inactive), as it makes favorable hydro-phobic interactions with Met-766 and Leu-777 in the active state.
Increased ATP Affinity of the L858R/T790M Mutant Confers Drug
Resistance. The binding data and crystal structures clearly dem-
onstrate that the gatekeeper mutation does not sterically blockbinding of reversible inhibitors. Why then does the T790Mmutation confer resistance? Kinetic characterization of the WTand mutant EGFR kinases reveals a marked decrease in theMichaelis-Menten constant ( K
m) for ATP in the drug-resistant
L858R/T790M mutant as compared with the drug-sensitiveL858R mutant (Table 2). As described (8, 10), the L858R mutantactivates EGFR, but also reduces the apparent affinity for ATP(Table 2). Strikingly, the T790M mutation restores the ATPaffinity to near WT levels in the L858R/T790M double mutant(K
m[ATP] /H110058.4/H9262M, as compared with Km[ATP] /H11005148/H9262M for the
L858R mutant). In isolation, the T790M mutation does notsignificantly affect ATP affinity. We cannot explain structurallywhy the T790M mutation increases ATP affinity in the contextof the L858R mutant, but not in the context of the WT enzyme.
We also find that the T790M mutation activates the kinase
/H110155-fold as compared with the WT enzyme (Table 2); this
catalytic activation of the T790M mutant likely explains itspresence as a germ-line mutation in a family predisposed to lungcancer (21). Although the L858R/T790M mutant has a modestlydecreased k
catrelative to the L858R mutant, it is still much more
active than the WT enzyme and also exhibits a 5-fold higherk
cat/Km[ATP] than the L858R mutant (Table 2).
Because TKIs such as gefitinib must compete with ATP for
binding to the kinase active site, the enhanced ATP affinity isexpected to decrease the apparent inhibitor potency. In theL858R/T790M mutant this ‚Äò‚Äò K
meffect‚Äô‚Äô combines with the small
difference in binding affinity for gefitinib to dramatically de-Table 1. Inhibitor dissociation constants for the WT and mutant

from rabbit muscle (Sigma-Aldrich; catalogue no. P-0294), 0.5 mM NADH, and
0.5/H9262M EGFR kinase; ATP at varied concentration was added last to start the
reaction. Steady-state initial velocity data were drawn from the slopes of theA
340curves and Ô¨Åt to the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine VmandKm
values. To assure that our derived kcatparameters reÔ¨Çected concentrations of
active enzyme, we estimated the active enzyme concentration of every kinasepreparation by titration of the samples with the tight binding inhibitorgeÔ¨Åtinib or AEE788 (see below).
Inhibition assays were carried out by using the same kinetic assay method,
with 10 mM MgCl
2and 1.25 mM EGFR autophosphorylation site peptide
(ENAEYLRVA) as the phospho-acceptor substrate. The ATP concentration wasÔ¨Åxed at 10

were added before the addition of ATP.
Binding Constant Assay and Calculation of the KiappValues. The equilibrium
Ô¨Çuorescence quenching method was used to obtain the binding constant andestimate the active enzyme concentration as described (8). Fluorescence mea-surements were carried out in a nitrogen-sparged buffer containing 20 mM
Tris, 0.5% glycerol, 250 mM NaCl, and 1 mM TCEP. The obtained K
dvalues and
Km,ATP were used to calculate the Kiappvalues using the following equation
(40):

assuming that the Kdvalues obtained in the binding assays are equal to Ki
under the condition of the above kinetic assays.

active enzyme, we estimated the active enzyme concentration of every kinasepreparation by titration of the samples with the tight binding inhibitorgeÔ¨Åtinib or AEE788 (see below).
Inhibition assays were carried out by using the same kinetic assay method,
with 10 mM MgCl

were added before the addition of ATP.
Binding Constant Assay and Calculation of the KiappValues. The equilibrium
Ô¨Çuorescence quenching method was used to obtain the binding constant andestimate the active enzyme concentration as described (8). Fluorescence mea-surements were carried out in a nitrogen-sparged buffer containing 20 mM

from rabbit muscle (Sigma-Aldrich; catalogue no. P-0294), 0.5 mM NADH, and
0.5/H9262M EGFR kinase; ATP at varied concentration was added last to start the
reaction. Steady-state initial velocity data were drawn from the slopes of theA
340curves and Ô¨Åt to the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine VmandKm
values. To assure that our derived kcatparameters reÔ¨Çected concentrations of
active enzyme, we estimated the active enzyme concentration of every kinasepreparation by titration of the samples with the tight binding inhibitorgeÔ¨Åtinib or AEE788 (see below).
Inhibition assays were carried out by using the same kinetic assay method,
with 10 mM MgCl
2and 1.25 mM EGFR autophosphorylation site peptide
(ENAEYLRVA) as the phospho-acceptor substrate. The ATP concentration wasÔ¨Åxed at 10
/H9262M or 1 mM, and the indicated concentrations of the inhibitors
were added before the addition of ATP.
Binding Constant Assay and Calculation of the KiappValues. The equilibrium
Ô¨Çuorescence quenching method was used to obtain the binding constant andestimate the active enzyme concentration as described (8). Fluorescence mea-surements were carried out in a nitrogen-sparged buffer containing 20 mM
Tris, 0.5% glycerol, 250 mM NaCl, and 1 mM TCEP. The obtained K
dvalues and
Km,ATP were used to calculate the Kiappvalues using the following equation
(40):
Kiapp/H11005Ki/H208491/H11001/H20851ATP/H20852/Km,ATP/H20850,
assuming that the Kdvalues obtained in the binding assays are equal to Ki
under the condition of the above kinetic assays.
